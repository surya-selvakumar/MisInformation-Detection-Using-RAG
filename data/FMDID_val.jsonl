Kobach, a Republican who has become a national leader in pushing for aggressive measures against undocumented immigrants and strengthening voter identification laws, touted his tough on immigration record at an announcement event for next yearâ€™s race.  â€œStrong borders and respect for rule of law are essential to our country and to our state,â€ Kobach said.  â€œKansas is the sanctuary state of the Midwest. We are the only state in the five state area that has done nothing to discourage illegal immigration.â€   Measures would include ending sanctuary policies in Kansas counties, cutting public benefits and welfare to undocumented people, ending in-state tuition for undocumented students at state universities and insuring that state and local law enforcement cooperate with federal immigration authorities, he said.  As secretary of state, Kobach was a strong proponent of tightening Kansasâ€™ voter identification statutes since he was elected in 2010, making the state a symbol for mostly Republican Party supporters who said the rules were meant to prevent voter fraud.  Opponents, mostly Democrats, said they discriminate against minorities and Kobachâ€™s efforts faced numerous legal challenges.  Trump created a commission last month to investigate voter fraud following his unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival in the 2016 U.S. election.  Since July 2015, Kobach has secured nine convictions for voter fraud in Kansas, according to a May statement from his office.  Kobach, an Ivy League and Oxford educated former Department of Justice official, said in addition to tackling illegal immigration, he would crackdown on lobbying in state capital Topeka as well as fight tax increases if elected.   He was highly critical of a move by Republican lawmakers on Tuesday to override a veto by Republican Governor Sam Brownback of legislation that would raise taxes, saying there was no need to feed the â€œgovernment monster.â€  The measure essentially rolls back income tax rate cuts the state enacted in 2012 that led to budget shortfalls. The higher rates are expected to raise $591 million in fiscal 2018, which begins July 1, and $633 million in fiscal 2019, according to a legislative analysis of the bill.", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: The U.S. Congress was wrestling with healthcare again on Tuesday, as lawmakers from both parties considered some approaches beyond simply repealing and replacing Obamacare. The widened healthcare discussion appeared unlikely to yield dramatic changes soon, but marked a shift from the long-running, Republican effort to gut 2010â€™s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is formally known. Republicansâ€™ last attempt in July to overturn former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law fell one short in the Senate in a humiliating defeat for President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In one Senate committee, a bipartisan effort was under way on Tuesday to repair Obamacare without repealing it, led by the Republican health committee chairman, Lamar Alexander, and the panelâ€™s top Democrat, Patty Murray. They want to stabilize the Obamacare individual insurance market by protecting its â€œcost-sharing subsidies.â€ Those payments go to insurers to help reduce out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans enrolled in Obamacare. Trump, who made repealing and replacing Obamacare a major campaign promise, has repeatedly threatened to stop the payments, which insurers say would force a 20 percent premium price increase. Alexander, who also wants states to have more flexibility to design health insurance plans under Obamacare, said on Tuesday the goal was a â€œsmall bipartisan stepâ€ that could break the years-long partisan stalemate over the law. The Tennessee lawmaker said he hoped to have a bipartisan consensus proposal by sometime next week, although it was unclear if McConnell would bring such a measure to the floor. He was noncommittal when asked about it on Tuesday. Some Republicans were supportive. Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson said if the government did not keep funding the cost-sharing subsidies, insurance premiums would likely rise and the government would have to spend more money on tax credits that help consumers afford the premiums. â€œThe insurance companies get their money either way,â€ Johnson told Reuters. Maine Republican Susan Collins, who voted against repealing and replacing Obamacare in July, said she hoped to support the bipartisan Obamacare repair effort. â€œBased on the hearings so far, (I) would expect to,â€ she said. The effort was being watched closely by companies such as Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), which has trimmed the number of states and counties in which it will sell Obamacare plans in 2018. The company said on Tuesday it was still working with some state regulators on its market participation for next year [L2N1LT17A]. Anthem and other insurers have a deadline of Sept. 27 to finalize their 2018 Obamacare roles. Separately, independent Senator Bernie Sanders, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, was pushing a plan to widen the Medicare health insurance program for seniors, to include everyone. Most Republicans looked askance at the idea, which Sanders has long championed, while some leading Democrats like House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said their priority was improving Obamacare. The Republican anti-Obamacare campaign was not entirely over. Two Republicans were planning to announce a new repeal-and-replace proposal on Wednesday that has White House support. Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy will offer legislation to give states money in the form of block grants instead of the federal funding states get under Obamacare. Critics said the approach would effectively cut billions of dollars in funding for Obamacare subsidies and for the Medicaid program for the poor that many states expanded under Obamacare. The Cassidy-Graham bill must pass by the end of September to comply with Senate procedural rules allowing it to advance with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes needed for most bills. â€œIt would take an extraordinary lift to get that done before the deadline,â€ said Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership.", "output": "1.

A spokeswoman for Australia s immigration minister Peter Dutton refused to comment. She said there had been no change in the government s policy of refusing to allow any asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach Australian shores, and detaining them instead in camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru in the South Pacific. The issue will be a key element of talks between Australia s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern on Sunday in Sydney.

But the movieâ€™s plucky intimacy shines through that fog. Itâ€™s a portrait, not a tribute  â€”   though as the documentary reminds us, every portrait is in some way a tribute to something. The film, directed by the actor Fisher Stevens and Alexis Bloom, debuts on HBO Saturday night after the cable network moved up its premiere from March. That decision is hard to begrudge. As this movie makes evident, these two were no strangers to making headlines. Ms. Reynolds was well known to one generation for, in part, the tabloid bonanza surrounding her when her husband Eddie Fisher skipped out with her best friend, Elizabeth Taylor. Several other generations have grown up surrounded by all things Princess Leia, memorably played by Ms. Fisher in the â€œStar Warsâ€ films. â€œBright Lightsâ€ finds mother and daughter living in separate houses in what they call â€œthe compound. â€ Ms. Fisher takes a soufflÃ© out of her oven and carries it on a tray down the path to her motherâ€™s house. â€œI usually come to her,â€ Ms. Fisher says. She pauses. â€œI always come to her. â€ Who wouldnâ€™t? Sheâ€™s Debbie Reynolds, movie star and cabaret performer. Ms. Reynolds rose to fame with cheery, wholesome roles, and even in her 80s could turn on that pert sunniness in a split second, so smoothly youâ€™d never know it was an act  â€”   except that this is a documentary, and it includes the footage of just before this light clicks on. â€œItâ€™s not my best day,â€ she sighs, sounding weary and a little   as she and Mr. Stevens discuss where exactly the camera will be. And then  â€”   bing!  â€”   there she is, as perky as a kindergarten teacher. Because the gently quirky celebrity documentary is an enjoyable if standardized format, the potency of â€œBright Lightsâ€ sneaks up on you. If it were just about its subjectsâ€™ huge, starry lives, that really would be enough for a documentary. But it also smartly, and subtly, pushes its audience to ask two of modern pop societyâ€™s central, uncomfortable questions: First, are famous people â€œrealâ€ people? And second, am I becoming my mother? By the time Mr. Stevens and Ms. Bloom start filming, this almost cosmic   between mother and daughter seems to have resolved itself to a wry but balanced mutual orbit. Though both women seem a little reluctant to admit it, the similarities between them abound. Ms. Fisherâ€™s house is decorated eclectically, with memorabilia and silly knickknacks everywhere. Ms. Reynoldsâ€™s collection is far more orderly: She was among Hollywoodâ€™s great archivists and had hoped to open a museum, but instead is resigned to auctioning off many of her pieces, including Marilyn Monroeâ€™s famous   dress from â€œThe Seven Year Itchâ€ and a pair of Judy Garlandâ€™s   shoes from â€œThe Wizard of Oz. â€ â€œI like my ghosts,â€ she tells her daughter. Ms. Fisher is brainy and salty and hilarious, and sheâ€™s frank and eloquent in describing being bipolar. We see both archival and    footage of Ms. Fisher in manic phases, and sheâ€™s articulate, artful even, about her  . â€œOne mood is the meal the next mood is the check,â€ she says. But she too knows how to flip the switch. She refers to her appearances at fan conventions as â€œthe lap dance,â€ but engages with her fans nonetheless. A woman cries. Little girls in their Princess Leia costumes beam. Their heroine gamely poses for photo after photo, signing every manner of memorabilia. Itâ€™s not so different, really, from her motherâ€™s cabaret act. That nightclub act comes up several times in â€œBright Lights,â€ including footage of a    Carrie being summoned to the stage to sing â€œBridge Over Troubled Water. â€ Her bold alto voice and sassy   almost, but donâ€™t quite, belie that sheâ€™s a barely cooperative teenager desperate to rebel. Ms. Fisher says she rejected singing more or less to spite her mother. Six or so years after that nightclub performance, she married Paul Simon. You know. The guy who wrote â€œBridge Over Troubled Water. â€ Itâ€™s all so Hollywood, so poetic, so dramatic. Despite their extraordinary circumstances, much of the family banter among Ms. Reynolds her son, Todd Fisher and Ms. Fisher seems like ordinary talk. Adult siblings agonize over an aging parentâ€™s finances and  . Mother and daughter have the same shoes. Brother and sister exchange knowing â€œwell, thatâ€™s Momâ€ shrugs. Thereâ€™s no people like show people, but Hollywood families are, somehow, still just families.", "output": "1. True"}

Michael Flynn resigned late on Monday after revelations he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. â€œItâ€™s obvious that Flynn was forced to write the letter of resignation under a certain amount of pressure,â€ Leonid Slutsky, head of the lower house of parliamentâ€™s foreign affairs committee, was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency. Flynn was a strong advocate for the need for softer foreign policy toward Russia and his departure could slow Trumpâ€™s pledge to improve relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. â€œThe target was Russia-U.S. relations, undermining confidence in the new U.S. administration,â€ Slutsky said, without specifying who he thought was responsible. Fellow lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev, who leads the upper house of parliamentâ€™s international affairs committee, said the resignation could be a sign of growing anti-Russian feeling in the White House. â€œEither Trump has not gained the requisite independence and he is gradually being (not unsuccessfully) backed into a corner, or Russophobia has already infected the new administration also from top to bottom,â€ Kosachev said on social media. The Kremlin has denied that Flynn discussed lifting sanctions with the Russian envoy and on Tuesday it declined further comment, saying the resignation was an internal matter for the United States. â€œWeâ€™ve said everything we want to say,â€ spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.

It has also gained a reputation for racial amity, from its nationally recognized commitment to busing and integrated schools in the 1970s and â€™80s, to the election of Harvey Gantt in 1983 as one of the Southâ€™s first prominent black mayors. But the fatal police shooting on Tuesday of a black resident, Keith Lamont Scott, and the protests that have followed are among numerous bumps and jolts that have shaken Charlotteâ€™s sense of itself recently as it emerged from a successful small city to a more complicated larger one. The tension continued on Thursday as Mr. Scottâ€™s family was allowed to view videos of the shooting but officials said they would not be made public. As protesters gathered for a third night, the mayor imposed a    a. m. curfew. After decades in which it willed itself to   status, Charlotte in the last decade has had to grapple with a host of   problems, including a corruption scandal that brought down a mayor, a recession that shook the banking industry to its foundations, a previous fatal police shooting of a black man in 2013 that sent angry residents into the streets and, this year, a   culture war with the state legislature over an   ordinance. There has also been a growing realization here of the depths of poverty that have come to coexist alongside the comfortable New South reality enjoyed by the cityâ€™s business class. Charlotte, with an estimated population of 827, 000, is a city of   memberships,   S. U. V.s in church parking lots and small plates of rabbit gnocchi at the clubby Wooden Vine Wine Bar and Bistro. But Mecklenburg County, of which Charlotte is the county seat, also ranked 99th among the largest 100 counties in the United States in a 2015 measure of poor childrenâ€™s economic mobility. It was one reason that the explosion of frustration this week did not catch everyone off guard. â€œIâ€™m not surprised,â€ said State Representative Carla Cunningham, an   who represents the neighborhood where Mr. Scott was killed. â€œThese social ills, at some point we must address them, because that is part of the hopelessness that these people are feeling. â€ On Wednesday night, Ms. Cunningham joined a few dozen people, many of them black, around the growing shrine to Mr. Scott in the parking lot of the tidy   apartment complex where he was shot. They spoke passionately about the need for police reform, but also about the fact that it was hard for them to get by in Charlotte. One woman said she was ready for her reparations payments, and for her promised 40 acres of land. â€œYou can keep the mule,â€ she quipped. LaWana Mayfield, a black woman who is a member of the City Council, said the week had been â€œa   call for some people in Charlotte. â€ But she quickly added: â€œFor a lot of people in Charlotte, itâ€™s not a   call. Itâ€™s a reality that we have already been dealing with. â€ Charlotte has long been a city built on business. Tom Hanchett, a historian here, notes that it was originally situated along a Native American trading path. It began to emerge as a banking powerhouse in the 1980s in part because of the efforts of Hugh L. McColl Jr. a banker and former Marine who, as chief executive of the NCNB Corporation, a Charlotte bank, oversaw a series of mergers and acquisitions and creative deals. The end product was the giant Bank of America corporation, today the stateâ€™s   private employer. Charlotte attracted even more banks, a number of corporate headquarters, and more and more people whose main interest was commerce. The newcomers who flocked here for new opportunities encountered a Southern city that had, in the 1950s and 1960s, chosen a relatively moderate, integrationist path, in contrast to places like Birmingham, Ala. But the city, which produces 30 percent of North Carolinaâ€™s gross domestic product, also suffers from serious racial disparities in income. Gene Nichol, a law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has been studying poverty in the city, noted in a recent study that the median household income for whites in Mecklenburg County is 86 percent more than the household income for blacks and Hispanics. â€œCharlotte has something of a structural problem, which is not uncommonâ€ in the United States, Mr. Nichol said Thursday. â€œCharlotte produces a lot of good jobs, a lot of   employment, and also a very large number of   jobs that do not provide an adequate living standard. â€ Charlotte residents like Samuel Henderson can feel stuck between the promise of the city of commerce and the reality of the city of the grind. Mr. Henderson, 24, an   is a house cleaner at a Charlotte hotel. He has some college education and two young children. He knows there are good jobs here, he said Thursday, â€œbut youâ€™ve got to go to college for them. â€ He dreams of a future in which he starts his own business in Charlotte. But when asked if that future would be bright, he equivocated. â€œItâ€™s a tough question,â€ he said. Though the Great Recession has come and gone here, the bomb that it set off in the banking industry shook the cityâ€™s confidence, said David Erdman, a lawyer and former member of the Charlotte City Council. Particularly distressing, Mr. Erdman said, was the 2008 fall of the giant   financial services corporation Wachovia, which was eventually acquired by Wells Fargo. At the time, Mr. McColl, in an interview with The Charlotte Observer, called the fall of Wachovia â€œa body blow to the city. â€ Other shudders were felt in the public sector in June 2014, when Patrick D. Cannon, who had stepped down as mayor in March, pleaded guilty to federal charges that he had accepted tens of thousands of dollars worth of bribes and perks from business interests while in office. In less than a year between 2013 and 2014, four people served as mayor. It was a surprising stain on a political system that many here had long considered to be efficient and clean. It is also a system that has thrived on consensus and   within a moderate band of   political expression. Voters, over the years, have backed both Mr. Gantt, a Democrat, and Pat McCrory, a Republican, who served as mayor from 1995 to 2009. Mr. McCrory is currently the North Carolina governor. The current mayor, Jennifer Roberts, is a Democrat. But that sense of   politics, too, seems to have ebbed with the City Councilâ€™s approval, in February, of an ordinance that allowed transgender people to use, while in publicly owned buildings, the restroom that corresponded with their gender identity. By the end of March, the   General Assembly, backed by Mr. McCrory, had passed legislation that overturned Charlotteâ€™s ordinance and restricted bathroom access for transgender people in public buildings across the state. A political, legal and cultural firestorm ensued. Performers like Bruce Springsteen canceled concerts in the state. The Atlantic Coast Conference and N. C. A. A. have pulled championship games out of the state. The N. B. A. decided to move the 2017   Game from Charlotte to New Orleans. In May, the federal Justice Department sued the state over the law, claiming it discriminated against transgender people. â€œDoggone, this has caused problems for our city and state,â€ Mr. Erdman said, including a test of Charlotteâ€™s consensus model. Mr. McCrory, who was popular among many Democrats as well as Republicans during his long tenure as Charlotte mayor, now finds himself in a difficult   race against his Democratic challenger and potentially alienated from voters in the stateâ€™s largest city. Tuesdayâ€™s police shooting came as no great surprise to Mr. Henderson, the hotel worker. He remembered similar protests after a   police officer shot Jonathan Ferrell, an unarmed college student and football player, in 2013. The officer in that case was charged with voluntary manslaughter, but the case ended in a hung jury and a mistrial. All of this complicated history was going around in Mr. Hendersonâ€™s head on Thursday as he mopped the floors of the hotel. But as he exchanged pleasantries with a visitor in the lobby, he spoke only of the most unruly protesters, and how they had complicated the cherished narrative of progress here. â€œTheyâ€™re making it worse,â€ he said, â€œnot making it better. â€", "output": "1.

The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad. The U.N. resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and, in a last-minute change, demands the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad within 24 months, instead of 12 months as first proposed. The U.S.-drafted resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Council to further reductions if it were to conduct another nuclear test or launch another ICBM. In a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, North Korea s foreign ministry said the United States was terrified by its nuclear force and was getting  more and more frenzied in the moves to impose the harshest-ever sanctions and pressure on our country . The new resolution was tantamount to a complete economic blockade of North Korea, the ministry said.  We define this  sanctions resolution  rigged up by the U.S. and its followers as a grave infringement upon the sovereignty of our Republic, as an act of war violating peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the region and categorically reject the  resolution ,  it said.  There is no more fatal blunder than the miscalculation that the U.S. and its followers could check by already worn-out  sanctions  the victorious advance of our people who have brilliantly accomplished the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force , the ministry said. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Nov. 29 declared the nuclear force complete after the test of North Korea s largest-ever ICBM test, which the country said puts all of the United States within range.  Kim told a meeting of members of the ruling Workers  Party on Friday that the country  successfully realized the historic cause of completing the state nuclear force  despite  short supply in everything and manifold difficulties and ordeals owing to the despicable anti-DPRK moves of the enemies . North Korea s official name is the Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK). South Korea s foreign ministry told Reuters it is aware of the North Korean statement on the new sanctions, again highlighting its position that they are a  grave warning by the international community that the region has no option but to immediately cease reckless provocations, and take the path of dialogue for denuclearization and peace . The North Korean foreign ministry said its nuclear weapons were a self-defensive deterrence not in contradiction of international law.  We will further consolidate our self-defensive nuclear deterrence aimed at fundamentally eradicating the U.S. nuclear threats, blackmail and hostile moves by establishing the practical balance of force with the U.S,  it said.  The U.S. should not forget even a second the entity of the DPRK which rapidly emerged as a strategic state capable of posing a substantial nuclear threat to the U.S. mainland,  it added. North Korea said those who voted for the sanctions would face its wrath.  Those countries that raised their hands in favor of this  sanctions resolution  shall be held completely responsible for all the consequences to be caused by the  resolution  and we will make sure for ever and ever that they pay heavy price for what they have done.  The North s old allies China and Russia both supported the latest U.N. sanctions. Tension has been rising over North Korea s nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House. In November, North Korea demanded a halt to what it called  brutal sanctions , saying a round imposed after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 constituted genocide. U.S. diplomats have made clear they are seeking a diplomatic solution but proposed the new, tougher sanctions resolution to ratchet up pressure on North Korea s leader. China, with which North Korea does some 90 percent of its trade, has repeatedly called for calm and restraint from all sides.  China said on Saturday the new resolution also reiterated the need for a peaceful resolution via talks and that all sides needed to take steps to reduce tensions. Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said on Saturday  the tougher resolution was aimed at preventing war. It suggested the United States had wanted an even harsher resolution, and noted there was no indication in the resolution that the United Nations could grant the United States permission for military action.  The difference between the new resolution and the original U.S. proposal reflects the will of China and Russia to prevent war and chaos on the Korean Peninsula.

The Ways and Means Committee is one of three panels with the authority to subpoena tax returns. Defying decades of precedent, Trump has refused to release his tax returns. This has made it harder for watchdogs to determine how his actions as president may affect his sprawling business empire, including his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Trump is hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe this weekend. Critics say disclosing tax returns would help settle concerns about possible conflicts of interest. While Democrats say tax committees in Congress should exercise their authority to request Trumpâ€™s federal tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service, Republicans who control Congress have shown little interest in doing so. â€œI donâ€™t think we can roll all over people just because theyâ€™re in a position of government,â€ said Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who chairs both the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the two other panels with the authority to request tax records.

Force was a graduate student at Vanderbilt University in Corkerâ€™s home state, Tennessee, when he was killed. Forceâ€™s parents live in South Carolina, the home state of Senator Lindsey Graham, the actâ€™s other Republican co-sponsor.     Graham, who dubbed the payments â€œpay to slay,â€ is chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees foreign aid. Palestinian officials have said they intend to continue the payments, which they see as support for relatives of those imprisoned by Israel for fighting against occupation or who have died in connection with that cause. To win broader support, the original act was modified to take into account the need for humanitarian aid. It exempts assistance for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network, creates an escrow account to hold assistance funds and spells out steps the Palestinian Authority can take for aid to resume. Corker said he was confident the bill would become law sometime in the coming months. Similar legislation has also been introduced in the House of Representatives. Opponents of the bill have said they worry that cutting off economic aid to the Palestinians would increase poverty and instability in the West Bank and Gaza, fueling more violence.", "output": "1.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: WASHINGTON  â€”   The continuing fallout from President Trumpâ€™s unsubstantiated wiretapping allegation cost him another ally on Thursday, as the embattled Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee announced he would step aside from his panelâ€™s investigation into Russiaâ€™s efforts to disrupt last yearâ€™s election. The announcement from the committeeâ€™s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California, came shortly before the House Committee on Ethics said he was under investigation because of public reports that he â€œmay have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information. â€ Mr. Nunesâ€™s recusal from the Russia inquiry was a blow to Mr. Trump, who in less than three months in office has seen the imbroglio over Russiaâ€™s disruption campaign exact political damage on some of his closest advisers and most vigorous supporters. The furor over the contacts that some of the presidentâ€™s aides had with Russian officials has already led to the firing of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trumpâ€™s national security adviser, and the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from overseeing the F. B. I. â€™s inquiry into the Russian efforts. Now it has led to the recusal of Mr. Nunes from the House Intelligence Committeeâ€™s Russia investigation, and Mr. Trump faces the potential revival of that inquiry. The investigation had descended into a partisan sideshow in the two weeks since Mr. Nunes told reporters that Trump associates had been swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by American spy agencies during the transition, citing intelligence reports that were classified. He then rushed to the White House to brief Mr. Trump, prompting Democrats to argue that Mr. Nunes had proved himself far too close to the president to run an independent investigation. The criticism intensified last week when The New York Times revealed that the classified information about incidental surveillance cited by Mr. Nunes came from White House officials. White House officials had been seeking evidence to bolster a claim that Mr. Trump made March 4 on Twitter that the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. Numerous current and former American officials  â€”   including James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director  â€”   have debunked the claim. Yet Mr. Nunes resisted demands to step aside until Thursday, when he found himself under investigation by the House ethics committee. The internal House ethics investigation into whether Mr. Nunes disclosed classified information is a striking twist for a chairman who has made the unauthorized disclosure of classified information a focal point of his Russia investigation. At the same time, he has repeatedly dismissed the idea that he was wrong to disclose the existence of â€œdozensâ€ of classified intelligence reports about incidental surveillance of associates of Mr. Trump. â€œAny talk of that is nonsense,â€ Mr. Nunes said in an interview with The Times last month. Mr. Nunes said in a statement that the ethics investigation was â€œentirely false and politically motivatedâ€ and that he would remain the intelligence committeeâ€™s chairman. But it was in the intelligence committeeâ€™s best interests for him to temporarily step aside from the Russia investigation, he said in the statement, which was issued 26 minutes before the ethics committee announced its inquiry. The statement also put the blame for the investigation on complaints against him made by multiple watchdog groups to the Office of Congressional Ethics, which is entirely separate from the ethics committee. Mr. Nunes dismissed those organizations as â€œ  activist groups,â€ though it was not clear what role, if any, their complaints played in setting off the inquiry. Mr. Nunes, who served on the presidentâ€™s transition team, has for weeks offered Mr. Trump fuel to keep his wiretapping claims in the news  â€”   and to make more unsubstantiated accusations. In an interview with The Times on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that the former national security adviser Susan E. Rice might have committed a crime by seeking the identities of the Trump associates who last year were swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by American spy agencies. Ms. Rice has said she did nothing wrong. Mr. Nunesâ€™s recusal on Thursday was welcomed by Democrats, who had questioned whether White House officials had used the congressman essentially to launder the information about incidental surveillance. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the panelâ€™s top Democrat, praised the chairmanâ€™s decision. â€œIt will allow us to have a fresh start moving forward,â€ he told reporters on Thursday. Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, a senior Republican on the committee, will assume control of the investigation. An accountant who formerly served as the chairman of the House ethics committee, Mr. Conaway will be assisted by two other Republicans on the committee, Mr. Nunes said: Representatives Tom Rooney of Florida and Trey Gowdy of South Carolina. Mr. Gowdy led the special investigation into the 2012 attacks on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. Mr. Gowdy is also on the ethics committee. Several of the watchdog groups that had complained to the separate Office of Congressional Ethics praised the ethics committeeâ€™s decision to investigate Mr. Nunes. Jordan Libowitz, spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, described the congressmanâ€™s disclosure of classified information as â€œso grave that it needs to be investigated right away. â€ The ethics committee comprises 10 House members: five Republicans and five Democrats. It is unclear how long the inquiry could take, but the investigations usually last months or years. The panel has the power to impose a range of penalties, from a letter admonishing a member to a recommendation that the House vote to expel a member. In more serious cases, the panel can choose to refer evidence to law enforcement officials, a move it can make confidentially. The independent Office of Congressional Ethics faced a threat in early January when House Republicans voted to gut it on the eve of the new Congress. Under pressure from Republican leaders and President Trump, they ultimately abandoned the effort. The recusal offered hope to Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, who worried that Mr. Nunesâ€™s behavior had discredited the panelâ€™s investigation and who had increasingly resigned themselves to the idea that they would have to conduct parallel inquiries rather than work with Republicans. â€œWe now have a chance to reclaim our committeeâ€™s independence, credibility and ability to make progress,â€ Representative Eric Swalwell of California said in a statement. As the House investigation has deteriorated into partisan feuding in recent weeks, many have turned to the Senate Intelligence Committee as Congressâ€™s last best hope for an impartial congressional investigation into Russian interference in the election. Since late July, the F. B. I. has been conducting its own counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the election, including an examination of whether Mr. Trumpâ€™s associates cooperated with Russian officials to influence the race.", "output": "1.

Jan Chamberlin resigned after five years with the choir, which originates from Utah, over the Jan. 20 ceremony, saying it â€œwill appear that (the) Choir is endorsing tyranny and fascism by singing for this man.â€ With three weeks to go before Trump is sworn in, teen classical singer Jackie Evancho is the only celebrity to have unequivocally embraced her role in an inauguration ceremony marked by soul-searching by larger invited groups, and fan backlash. The 1960s pop group, The Beach Boys, is considering an invitation to perform but has yet to make a final decision, a spokesman for the band said on Friday. â€œI simply cannot continue with the recent turn of events. I could never look myself in the face again,â€ Chamberlin wrote in a resignation letter that she posted on Facebook on Thursday. A separate petition on change.org started by Randall Thacker, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, had gathered more than 22,000 signatures on Friday. The petition says the participation of the Tabernacle Choir in Trumpâ€™s inauguration does not reflect the Churchâ€™s values and would harm its worldwide image. The Church says taking part in the inauguration is voluntary, and notes that the Tabernacle Choir, which hails from Salt Lake City, Utah, has sung at such celebrations for five previous Republican presidents. Church spokesman Eric Hawkins said on Friday public response to the inauguration plans â€œhas been mixed, with people expressing both opposition and support. The Choirâ€™s participation... is not an implied support of party affiliations or politics. It is a demonstration of our support for freedom, civility and the peaceful transition of power.â€  Some dancers in the Radio City Rockettes were also unhappy at performing. â€œWe do a lot of events, but there have been no events that could cause trauma. And doing this would cause trauma for some people,â€ one Rockettes dancer said this week, speaking anonymously with Marie Claire magazine. Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli suffered a fan backlash on social media after reports that he was planning to sing for Trump. Bocelli and country singer Garth Brooks both backed out of performing at the inauguration.

The decision, issued the next day, came after the prospective lawmakers, Sixtus Leung, 30, and Yau   25, made controversial remarks last month during an   ceremony in Hong Kongâ€™s Legislative Council. Rather than say â€œChinaâ€ in their oaths, they said â€œâ€ a term that many find offensive, associating it with its use by Japan during its occupation of China during World War II. Ms. Yau also added an expletive to her oath. Relations between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, a former British colony of 7. 3 million, were already frayed by   demonstrations that erupted in 2014 in response to the Chinese governmentâ€™s rejection of calls for free elections in the territory. The remarks by the two politicians, who have argued that Hong Kong should be independent from China, were widely seen as acts of defiance  â€”   and catalysts for a renewed political crisis. Where does the term â€˜ â€™ come from? Aoki Masaru, a Japanese Sinologist, argued that it originated in early Sanskrit transcriptions of Qin, the name of the dynasty that unified China more than 2, 000 years ago, according to a 2012 essay by the historian Joshua A. Fogel. Qin, pronounced â€œchin,â€ may have contributed to the countryâ€™s name in many Western languages. With the spread of Buddhism from India, and the translation of scriptures into Chinese, the word entered China and then Japan. Professor Fogel, who teaches at York University in Toronto, wrote that the Japanese used the name   for centuries, but especially from the 19th century through World War II. Before the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, the country had no official symbols or constitution, noted Xu Guoqi, a professor of history at the University of Hong Kong who is writing a book titled â€œThe Idea of China. â€ Its last imperial dynasty, the Qing, was established by Manchu invaders in the 17th century. Many Chinese nationalists and reformers in the final years of Qing rule  â€”   such as Liang Qichao and Zhang Taiyan  â€”   used the term â€œwith no hidden bad meaning,â€ he said.   was one of many names these intellectuals used to refer to their country, said John Delury, a professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. Some of the intellectuals were involved in the   resistance and had gone into exile in Japan, he added. â€œThey felt their country had been stolen for hundreds of years by an invading,   Chinese, Manchu people, and now they were trying to get it back,â€ Professor Delury said. They were searching for a name for the new nation, he said, that would differentiate it from the Qing dynasty. When did Chinese people begin to view the term   as a slur? The term is the name for China that has â€œmost exercised Chinese opinionâ€ throughout history, Professor Fogel wrote in his 2012 essay. Jan Kiely, a professor of Chinese studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said in an email that â€œstrong feelingsâ€ were stirred in Chinese people when the Japanese Empire used the word to refer to China during its incursions into Chinese territory, from the     War through World War II. For many Chinese today, Professor Kiely said,   recalls the sufferings of the occupation and references a Japanese imperial sense that the Chinese were inherently inferior. On Monday, Li Fei, the chairman of Chinaâ€™s parliamentary committee on the Basic Law, the   that governs Hong Kong, criticized Mr. Leung and Ms. Yau for using the term. â€œI especially condemn insults to the country and the nation,â€ Mr. Li told reporters in Beijing. â€œI hope Hong Kong people do not forget how Chinese were slaughtered by the Japanese invaders, and especially that the Japanese invaders committed huge crimes when they occupied Hong Kong. â€ Professor Kiely said that public memory of World War II had surged in China over the past two decades in tandem with rising nationalism, thanks in part to a proliferation of   memorials, museums, exhibitions and documentaries about the war. If the term   can be perceived as a slur against Chinese people, why did the two Hong Kong politicians include it in their   remarks? Professor Delury said the politicians appeared to be making a satirical comparison between the Chinese governmentâ€™s current control over Hong Kong and Japanâ€™s invasion in the 20th century. He said it was significant that the remarks were made in the context of what is normally an   ceremony that is designed to indicate submission to the Chinese government. â€œAll this historical stuff is very interesting, but at a certain level,â€ he said, â€œwhat theyâ€™re trying to do here is to register their refusal to obey the way theyâ€™re being told to obey. â€ But the  â€™ critics include people in Hong Kong who have pushed for democratic reforms in its political system. What explains that? After taking the oath in the Legislative Council, Mr. Leung attributed his pronunciation of China as â€œ â€ to his local Hong Kong accent. But Ming Sing, a professor of social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said in an interview that some people in Hong Kong dismissed that explanation as â€œmoral hypocrisy,â€ because Mr. Leung had previously made a point of attacking   legislators for their purported unwillingness to challenge the Chinese government. â€œHe was perceived to cover up his real intent,â€ Professor Sing said. Professor Sing said that many people in Hong Kong also believed that the two politiciansâ€™ remarks at the   ceremony handed the Chinese government a pretext to reinterpret the Basic Law, which was negotiated before Britain returned the territory to Chinese rule in 1997. He said they fear the Basic Law may be interpreted â€œin a way that could undermine the rule of law and political freedoms in Hong Kong. â€", "output": "1. True"}

Parts of the city have been gripped by tension since Friday when at least five people were killed in violence involving the police and opposition supporters who were accompanying their leader Raila Odinga after a trip abroad.  Japheth Koome, the police commander in the city, said investigations had started after four bodies were found in the Mathare Area Four slum on Sunday morning.   We went there and found those bodies with injuries,  he told a news conference, describing the murders as a criminal act rather than ethnic-driven violence. The violence took place a day before the Supreme Court rules on two cases seeking to nullify the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta in a repeat election held last month. Odinga, who successfully petitioned against Kenyatta s initial victory in the Aug. 8 vote and subsequently boycotted the repeat poll, visited the scene of the murders on Sunday and accused the government of being behind the killings.  Those who are doing these acts are the ones who already lost and want to hold onto power by force but we will remove them using the power of the people,  he told a crowd of his supporters. Police fired teargas and used water cannons to disperse protesters for the better part of the morning until calm was restored in the area in the afternoon. The broadcast industry regulator, Communications Authority of Kenya, said it had banned live broadcasts of political rallies, after all the main TV stations showed hours of live footage of the chaos that greeted Odinga s return.

As Jesus told his disciples, according to the Gospel of John, Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\n\nCaptain Khan is a hero. I am sure the soldiers he served with regard him as one. I know you and your wife do. Rest assured that millions of veterans regard your son as a hero as well.\n\nTo paraphrase from the Book of Ecclesiasticus, your sonâ€™s name liveth for evermore.\n\nYour son made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, a country that was new to you and your family and one which you openly embraced and certainly love.\n\nWhen you and your family arrived to America from Pakistan, you assimilated into our country. You adopted American ways, learned our history and apparently you even acquired a pocket Constitution along the way. Good for you sir.\n\nBut, there are many Muslims in America who not only have no desire to assimilate, but wish to live under Sharia Law.\n\nThat is unacceptable to Americans. There is only one law of the land. That is the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAs you well know, Mr. Khan, we live in violent times, dangerous times. Muslim madmen from ISIS and other radical Jihadi groups are on a murder and terror spree across the globe.\n\nYour religion of peace, Islam, is anything but that in 2016. That is a fact that is confirmed every time a Muslim shoots, bombs, beheads and tortures innocent men, women and children. This does not mean that every Muslim is a terrorist, but most terrorists, sir, are indeed Muslims.\n\nA Muslim terrorist attack has become the sign of the times.\n\nRegardless of what the feckless, naÃ¯ve, leftist ideologue Barack Obama and his dimwitted colleagues John Kerry, Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel state, the United States and the West are at war with Radical Islam. It is the job of the president of the United States to protect his nation from all enemies; foreign and domestic. Unfortunately, Mr. Obama romanticizes Islam and refuses to accept reality, which has resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent people across the world.\n\nGroups like ISIS and Al Qaeda have one goal, the complete destruction of the Judeo-Christian culture, our religions and our way of life.\n\nMany Americans have families that have been here for decades, even centuries. Many families like mine have relatives who fought in the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam and Desert Storm. Some families have relatives who fought in the American Revolution.\n\nWe donâ€™t plan on letting our country be devoured by Muslim maniacs. We are Americans sir, and not unarmed, socialist European zombies. We will do what is necessary to protect the United States. While many Democrats and liberals see the world through rose colored glasses, conservatives understand that there is good and evil in this world. Evil must be destroyed before it destroys us.\n\nStrong measures, wartime measures, must be taken to protect this country from those that wish to annihilate us and our way of life.\n\nMr. Trumpâ€™s plan to temporarily halt immigration from Muslim countries that are known to either support terrorism or harbor terrorist groups is not only pragmatic, but indeed it is constitutional. It is the constitutional duty of the president of the United States to protect this nation.\n\nThere is simply no way to vet hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees from war zones like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nEurope is being destroyed because reckless leaders like Angela Merkel have opened the continentâ€™s doors to a flood of over one million undocumented Muslims arriving with nothing more than a bad attitude and a haversack of Jihad.\n\nDo you think Americans are stupid? While the left lives in a dream world, the right does not. Mr. Trump understands the threat to his nation and the threat, sir, is not from Swedish Lutherans named Anna and Lars. The threat, sir, is from radical Islam.\n\nHow in Godâ€™s name are U.S. immigration authorities supposed to know the true intentions of a 22-year-old Syrian man? It is impossible. You know it is impossible.\n\nHow in Godâ€™s name are U.S. immigration authorities supposed to know the true intentions of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and thousands of other sundry Muslims who wish to arrive on our shores?\n\nIt is impossible. You know it is impossible.\n\nWhether you, your wife, the Muslim world and millions of Democrats are offended by Mr. Trumpâ€™s realistic view of the world is irrelevant.\n\nWhether you, your wife and son would have been prohibited from emigrating from Pakistan to America under Mr. Trumpâ€™s wartime plan is irrelevant. The security of this great land supersedes your desires and the desires of others who wish to come here now. The United States of America has no obligation to open its doors in order to placate foreigners and liberals in our government.\n\nTo adopt any other course but Mr. Trumpâ€™s would be a cause for further endangering the lives of Americans every day. That, sir, is unacceptable.\n\nYou attacked Mr. Trump in front of a worldwide audience, yet you canâ€™t understand the fact that he defends himself against attacks from you, Hillary Clinton and the left. What else is one to do sir?\n\nWe must live in a world of reality, not a world of denial, delusion and fantasy the Democrats inhabit every waking day of their lives.\n\nRadical Islam is the enemy of everyone on this planet who believes in freedom and justice.

Trump told the New York Times he would most likely seek repayment through renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which groups the United States, Mexico and Canada. Sean Spicer, a spokesman for Trump, said on Friday the incoming administration would need government funding to build the wall and that Trump said in October Mexicoâ€™s payment would be a reimbursement. â€œThe idea that weâ€™re going through the appropriations process and figuring out how to pay for it shouldnâ€™t be news,â€ he told a briefing, confirming earlier reports on the funding. Trumpâ€™s promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and make Mexico pay for it, was a major campaign theme and helped energize his supporters. The suggestion has infuriated Mexican officials who have said they would never agree to pay for a wall. Trump may face resistance in Congress to the idea of the United States paying for the wall. Some Republican lawmakers worry about the high cost and question whether it is the best way to solve the complex issue of illegal migration. Some conservative groups have called for a crackdown on benefits and jobs available to illegal migrants, which they say are a magnet for migration. Republican Representative Luke Messer told reporters on Friday he had proposed legislation to get Mexico to pay for the border wall by ending a child tax credit given to illegal immigrant parents, which he said cost $4.2 billion annually.  â€œIf you close that loophole for two years, you could pay for the higher ticket cost,â€ Messer said, referring to one estimate that a wall could cost $10 billion. CNN and other media organizations reported on Friday Trumpâ€™s transition team had signaled to congressional Republicans that he preferred to fund the wall through Congress as soon as April. In response, Trump tweeted that the media was not reporting that Mexico would repay money spent to build the wall. A â€˜Pay for the Wallâ€™ memo Trumpâ€™s team issued in early 2016 proposed pressuring Mexico by cutting off remittances from undocumented Mexicans in the United States. It proposed amending the Patriot Act, passed after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, to include wire transfers as accounts that could be frozen. â€œItâ€™s an easy decision for Mexico: make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion (in remittances) continues to flow into their country year after year,â€ the memo said. â€œWe have the leverage, so Mexico will back down,â€ it said. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nietoâ€™s office declined to comment on Trumpâ€™s comments on Friday. In August, Pena Nieto told Trump Mexico would not pay for a border wall. Representative Martha McSally, the Republican chair of the border and maritime security subcommittee, told Reuters a 2006 law known as the â€œSecure Fence Actâ€ would give Trump the authority he needs to extend fencing or build a wall. An internal report prepared by U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimates initial costs for expanding border fencing would cost over $11.3 billion. Building a wall would be more costly. Trump has signaled since being elected that he would be open to fencing rather than a wall in some areas.  If funding was tied to a government funding bill, lawmakers could be forced to approve it to avoid a government shutdown. House appropriators have no interest in threatening a shutdown, spokeswoman Jennifer Hing said. â€œThe (appropriations) committee has not received any request from the Trump team or GOP leadership on this issue. If and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it,â€ she said.

S. launch of Tomahawk missiles targeting a strategic Syrian airfield on Thursday night, Iran must be monitored carefully for the possibility that it may use its proxies for retaliation, especially against Israelâ€™s northern border. [Following eight years of inaction on Syria under the Obama administration, President Donald Trump demonstrated last night that he is willing to hold Syrian President Bashar   to account, this time by striking the Shayrat Airfield near the Syrian city of Homs that was believed to have been utilized to carry out a chemical weapons attack that killed scores of civilians.  The U. S. airstrikes signaled to Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers that Trump will act in Syria and the administration strongly supports the removal of the Syrian president  â€”   an important strategic ally of Moscow and Tehran. The U. S. military move demonstrates to Israel and the Sunni Arab bloc cast aside by Obamaâ€™s nuclear deal with the mullahs that American leadership has officially returned to the region. Assad himself is unlikely to retaliate since the last thing he wants amidst a   insurgency attempting to topple his regime is to go to war with Trump or expand the battlefield to U. S. ally Israel. Trumpâ€™s bold authority in Syria directly threatens Russian interests since it was Moscow that largely filled the security vacuum in that country when Obama repeatedly failed to take any meaningful action against Assad. However, Russiaâ€™s direct response will most likely be confined to vocal protestation, such as Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling the U. S. strikes â€œaggression against a sovereign nationâ€ carried out on a â€œ  pretext. â€ President Vladimir Putin cannot risk a military confrontation with Trump and Russia is already signaling willingness to abandon Assad to come to a larger regional accommodation. Still, there is the possibility that Russia may quietly support action by others, especially agents of a very nervous Iranian regime that has been preparing proxies for years who can heat up Israelâ€™s northern border and beyond.  Both Moscow and Tehran have reason for wanting Trump to pay a price for acting in their Syrian playground.  The question is whether they will dare to respond, even tacitly. And that brings us to Iran.  Trumpâ€™s embrace of Americaâ€™s traditional Sunni Arab partners at the expense of Tehran and his strong positions against the disastrous international nuclear agreement have been deeply concerning to the expansionist,   Twelvers in Tehran.  And while the removal of Assad from power would be a blow to Russia, depending on the ultimate outcome such a move could be disastrous for Iranâ€™s position in Syria.  Iranian Revolutionary Guard units have been fighting the   insurgents alongside the Syrian military and the   Hezbollah militia.  Syria represents a key pawn in Iranâ€™s geopolitical chessboard that stretches across the vital region. In recent weeks, there have been strong indications that Iran has been seeking to arm its Hezbollah proxy with even more advanced weapons that can target the Jewish state. Last month, Israel took the unusual step of striking a Hezbollah weapons convoy near the city of Palmyra that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was transporting advanced weapons to the   militia. Israeli leaders and Hezbollah terrorists have in recent weeks ratcheted up war rhetoric, with Israeli officials warning that Hezbollah, which can only act at the direction of Iran, has been preparing for conflict. Last Sunday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot warned the IDF would not hold back from striking Lebanese state institutions in a future conflict with Hezbollah. â€œThe recent declarations from Beirut make it clear that in a future war, the targets will be clear: Lebanon and the organizations operating under its authority and its approval,â€ Eisenkot stated. Hezbollah is not Iranâ€™s only option. Breitbart Jerusalem has been reporting on the formation of a â€œGolan Liberation Brigade,â€ which was announced last month by the   of the Iraqi Harakat al Nujaba Shiite militia and is reportedly being trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.  The   militia is another Iranian front that could be used to target Israelâ€™s Golan Heights at the behest of Tehran. The next few days and weeks will be critical in determining Iran and Russiaâ€™s resolve in the face of an awakened America that has returned from its   slumber.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: The U.S. Congress is expected to vote this week on sweeping, debt-financed tax legislation. Here are key parts of the bill. CORPORATE TAX RATE: Cuts corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, beginning Jan. 1, 2018. PASS-THROUGHS: Creates a 20 percent deduction for the first $315,000 of qualified business income for joint filers of pass-through businesses such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. For income above that threshold, the legislation phases in limits, producing an effective marginal tax rate of no more than 29.6 percent.   CORPORATE MINIMUM TAX: Repeals the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax, set up to ensure profitable corporations pay at least some tax. TERRITORIAL SYSTEM: Exempts U.S. corporations from U.S. taxes on most future foreign profits, ending the present worldwide system of taxing profits of all U.S.-based corporations, no matter where they are earned. This would align the U.S. tax code with most other industrialized nations, undercut many offshore tax-dodging strategies and deliver to multinationals a goal they have pursued for years.  REPATRIATION: Sets a one-time mandatory tax of 8 percent on illiquid assets and 15.5 percent on cash and cash equivalents for about $2.6 trillion in U.S. business profits now held overseas. This foreign cash pile was created by a rule making foreign profits tax-deferred if they are not brought into the United States, or repatriated. That rule would be rendered obsolete by the territorial system. ANTI-BASE EROSION MEASURES: Prevents companies from shifting profits out of the United States to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad. Sets an alternative minimum tax on payments between U.S. corporations and foreign affiliates, and limits on shifting corporate income through transfers of intangible property, including patents. In combination, these measures with the repatriation and territorial system provisions, represent a dramatic overhaul of the U.S. tax system for multinationals. CAPITAL EXPENSING: Allows businesses to immediately write off, or expense, the full value of investments in new plant and equipment for five years, then gradually eliminates this 100 percent expensing over five years beginning in year six. INTEREST DEDUCTION LIMIT: Caps business deductions for debt interest payments at 30 percent of taxable income, regardless of deductions for depreciation, amortization or depletion.  CLEAN ENERGY: Preserves tax credits for producing electricity from wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, municipal waste and hydropower. CARRIED INTEREST: Leaves in place â€œcarried interestâ€ loophole for private equity fund managers and some hedge fund managers, despite pledges by Republicans including President Donald Trump to close it. These financiers can now claim a lower capital gains tax rate on much of their income from investments held more than a year. A new rule would extend that holding period to three years, putting the loophole out of reach for some fund managers, but preserving its availability for many.   BRACKETS: Maintains the current seven tax brackets, but temporarily changes most of the income levels and rates. For married couples filing jointly, effective Jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $19,050, versus 10 percent up to $18,650 under existing law; 12 percent on $19,051 to $77,400, versus 15 percent on$18,651 to $75,900; 22 percent on $77,401 to $165,000, versus 25 percent on $75,901 to $153,100; 24 percent on $165,001 to $315,000, versus 28 percent on $153,101 to $233,350; 32 percent on $315,001 to $400,000, versus 33 percent on $233,351 to $416,700; 35 percent on $400,001 to $600,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $470,700 37 percent above $600,000, versus 39.6 percent above$470,700. For single individuals, effective Jan. 1, 2018 and ending in 2026, income tax would be: 10 percent up to $9,525, versus 10 percent up to $9,325 under existing law; 12 percent from $9,526 to $38,700, versus 15 percent on $9,326 to $37,950; 22 percent on $38,701 to $82,500, versus 25 percent on $37,951 to $91,900; 24 percent on $82,501 to $157,500, versus 28 percent on $91,901 to $191,650; 32 percent on $157,501 to $200,000, versus 33 percent on $191,651 to $416,700; 35 percent on $200,001 to $500,000, versus 35 percent on $416,701 to $418,400; 37 percent above $500,000, versus 39.6 percent above $418,400. These brackets would expire after 2025.

One of the methods used was a â€œtelegramâ€ app, an encrypted messaging service that ISIS often uses and is generally the first place the group takes credit for terror attacks.  The terror group named several prominent members of the Muslim community in both Germany and Austria as potential targets for assassination in an article entitled â€œKill the infidel imams in Germany and Austria. â€ Among the targets listed is Aiman Mazyek,   of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany. Mazyek has made controversial statements in the past, such as calling for German leaders to limit the number of migrants flowing into the country in late 2015. The Muslim leader has also slammed the   migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) likening them to Nazis after they revealed a platform of   last year. Omar   a Vienna city councilman for the Socialist Party (SPÃ–) and a member of the Council Committee on European and International Affairs was also listed as a target.   is also no stranger to controversy  â€”   in 2010 he led an official condemnation of Israel in the Vienna city hall over the Israeli raids on a flotilla heading for Gaza, which Israeli authorities claimed was not the  humanitarian mission activists stated it to be.   also led a protest against Israel in Vienna.

Killing Imams they donâ€™t agree with is nothing new for the Islamic State. In 2014 ISIS executed 13 clerics in the city of Mosul whom they deemed to be too moderate. Imam Muhammad al Mansuri was one of the victims of the terror group and was the imam in charge of the mosque in which ISIS leader     gave a rare public appearance to lead prayers. Islamic State killed a further six imams in early 2015 after they condemned the groupâ€™s actions when they burned Jordanian pilot Muâ€™ath Kasasbeh alive.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: HONG KONG  â€”   Since 2010, Yu Kai has followed the ritual every year: When a new Apple iPhone comes out, he gets rid of his old one and heads to a store in Beijing to buy the latest model. This year, however, he held back. Instead of buying the iPhone 6s, he has been waiting to see what the next iPhone looks like, and he said he might even switch to a model by a different maker. In China, where Apple has been a signifier of wealth and fashion, and where many Chinese update their smartphones each year, Mr. Yu is not an outlier. Appleâ€™s   earnings report on Tuesday showed how hard it can be to keep the attention of Chinaâ€™s fickle and increasingly    consumers. Timothy D. Cook, the companyâ€™s chief executive, said in an earnings call that sales in mainland China had fallen 11 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. Mr. Cook noted that sales had dropped from a high level: In the first quarter of 2015, sales were 80 percent higher than in the same period in 2014. But the decline announced on Tuesday is a setback for one of the most beloved brands in China. Chinaâ€™s young,   consumers are increasingly willing, analysts say, to try phones from the many competitors  â€”   including Huawei, Meizu and Xiaomi  â€”   that seek to compete with Apple on technical specifications and aesthetics but that offer their models at a few hundred dollars cheaper. Many customers like Mr. Yu, who is 29 and   consider the phone they use part of their personal identity, leading them to look at a broad range of available models. That being the case, Apple will have to fight to maintain its dominance of the high end of the market. Apple also faces other obstacles in China. Last week, the companyâ€™s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies services were shut down by a Chinese regulator, just six months after they started operating. The rare   by China suggests that Apple could face further pressure as the Chinese government increases its scrutiny of American companiesâ€™ operations within its borders. In the past four years, with strong demand in China for its products, Apple increased the number of retail stores in the country to 35 from just a handful, and Mr. Cook said on Tuesday that there would be 40 by the end of June. The company has also been able to tap into the enormous customer base of Chinaâ€™s largest wireless carrier, China Mobile, after years of talks resulted in an agreement in 2013 that brought the iPhone to the carrier. The deal contributed to Chinese consumers spending $59 billion on Apple products in the latest fiscal year. But one challenge for Appleâ€™s sales this year is that its most recent models do not represent a big leap from the previous generation. â€œEveryone bought a 6 series,â€ Steven C. Pelayo, a technology analyst at HSBC in Hong Kong, said by email, referring to models introduced in late 2014. They â€œwere less inclined to upgrade to a 6s, which only had very minor changes,â€ he added. Qu Dewei, who has been selling smartphones for four years in a technology mall in eastern Beijing, said it had been tough to sell iPhones since September, when the iPhone 6s came out. â€œItâ€™s been bad since then, itâ€™s been really bad,â€ Mr. Qu said as he leaned on the counter at his stall. On Wednesday afternoon, the mall where he works was largely empty. â€œNone of the brands do really great,â€ he said. â€œBut while I might sell one or two Huawei phones in 10 days, I may not even sell one iPhone 6s. â€ For years, smugglers have done a brisk business taking iPhones to mainland China from Hong Kong, where they cost less. But even the illegal sellers are feeling the pressure. In interviews, four smugglers who did well a year ago said they had now quit the trade. The iPhoneâ€™s weaker sales also reflect the broader slowdown in growth in Chinaâ€™s enormous smartphone market. Jason Low, an analyst in Shanghai with the research group Canalys, said he expected the Chinese smartphone market to grow only 4. 7 percent in 2016. As recently as 2013, it was growing 50 percent annually. â€œIf you look at the entire market, Apple cannot fight off so many competitors, like Samsung and local brands like Huawei and Oppo,â€ he said. â€œTheyâ€™re all trying to raise the average selling price, and that will bleed into Appleâ€™s sales flow. â€ Despite the pressure, Mr. Cook said in the earnings call on Tuesday that Apple was â€œoptimisticâ€ about China, even if it was losing ground. There is even a precedent for an Apple recovery: In 2012 and 2013, the companyâ€™s sales growth in China slowed as competitors like Samsung offered phones with larger screens, which are very popular in China. When Apple finally released a phone with a similar screen size in 2014, its market share roared back. In many ways, the company is in a similar position today. Samsungâ€™s Edge phones stand out with screens that have rounded edges on one side, and many in China say the camera on Huaweiâ€™s flagship model is better than Appleâ€™s camera. That puts more pressure on Apple to pack new features into the next iPhone, which is expected to come out this autumn. For Mo Chen, a    public relations professional who owns an iPhone 5, the next Apple smartphone will have to do much more than her current model for her to be tempted. She was blunt in her criticism: â€œThe iPhone 6 and 6s are really ugly. â€ Many of Ms. Moâ€™s   and former classmates use Android phones, she said, and she is considering switching to a device by the South Korean company or to a Chinese phone made by ZTE or One Plus. â€œI like Apple a lot,â€ she said. â€œI use an Apple computer. But in recent years, especially after I tried my friendsâ€™ Android phones, I realized that the brand has lost a bit of its charm. â€", "output": "1. True"}

The civil lawsuits present a potentially thorny issue for the two countries that have grown closer during the administration of President Barack Obama, who has visited the southeast Asian nation twice in the last two years. The lawsuits will likely affect relations, but they did not come as a surprise, said a U.S. congressional aide. â€œIt has been a concern of a lot of people for a long time. Corruption in Malaysia is a huge problem,â€ the aide said. No criminal charges have been filed in the scandal surrounding Malaysiaâ€™s 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, which was overseen by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Obama spoke generally with Najib on a visit to Malaysia last year about the need for transparency and good governance, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a news briefing. â€œFor business interests who are considering doing business in Malaysia, theyâ€™re going to be looking for signs that there is good business climate,â€ Earnest told reporters. The Malaysian government â€œshould be conspicuous about making clear that theyâ€™re committed to transparency and good governance, and the kind of rules that will encourage people who are considering investing in Malaysiaâ€™s fast-growing economy to have confidence that they can do so fairly,â€ Earnest said. Najib said in response to the lawsuits that his government would give its full cooperation to international investigations of the 1MDB case. Malaysiaâ€™s foreign minister Anifah Aman met the U.S. Ambassador to Malaysia Joseph Yun on Thursday to discuss the lawsuits. â€œMalaysia highly values its bilateral relations with the United States and calls on the U.S. to recognize the various steps taken by the Government of Malaysia to address the 1MDB issue,â€ the ministry said in a statement on Thursday night. Malaysiaâ€™s Attorney-General Mohamed Apandi Ali, however, expressed â€œstrong concerns at the insinuations and allegationsâ€ of wrongdoing against Najib in the lawsuits.  He said in a statement that none of the probes conducted by law enforcement agencies across the globe over the past year show that any funds were misappropriated from 1MDB. The U.S. investigation is the largest set of cases brought by the Justice Departmentâ€™s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, which seeks the forfeiture of the proceeds of foreign corruption. Targeting assets ranging from valuable paintings and a private jet to the 2013 hit movie â€œThe Wolf of Wall Streetâ€ and rights to popular songs, the civil lawsuits said $3.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB. 1MDB said in a statement that it was not a party to the lawsuit, did not have any assets in the United States, â€œnor has it benefited from the various transactions described.â€", "output": "1.

President Donald Trump and his Republicans had vowed for years to dismantle the law. It was a central campaign issue in 2016. Two House committees will next review the bill, so it could still change substantially. Here are its main provisions:  The Republicans want to eliminate next year Obamacareâ€™s income-based tax credits that help low-income people purchase individual insurance. These would be replaced with age-based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper income levels. While Obamacareâ€™s credits provided more assistance to those with lower incomes, those in the Republican plan would be largely based on age.  The Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including taxes on medical devices, health insurance premiums, indoor tanning salons, prescription medications and high-cost employer-provided insurance known as â€œCadillacâ€ plans. Those taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep.  The bill also repeals the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans.  And it repeals the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees. Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including several Republican states, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until January 1, 2020, providing states that chose not to expand under Obamacare a window to enroll more people. After that date, the expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. States that did not expand Medicaid would receive additional funds through a number of changes, including the reinstatement of disproportionate share hospital payments, money that is provided to hospitals that serve a large number of Medicaid and uninsured people. State Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover the same essential health benefits that health insurers on Obamacareâ€™s exchanges must provide. That fulfills a Republican promise to return more control to the states, as they can decide what their Medicaid plans must cover. The Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacareâ€™s most popular provisions. It would allow young people to stay on their parentsâ€™ health plan until age 26, ban insurers from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions and bans insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage. But the bill would allow insurers to mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more.  Insurers won another provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more. It would also allow states to set their own ratio.  The measure also provides states with $100 billion to create programs for patient populations, including high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. The bill would also revoke federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year.", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Marking another milestone for a changing planet, scientists reported on Wednesday that the Earth reached its highest temperature on record in 2016, trouncing a record set only a year earlier, which beat one set in 2014. It is the first time in the modern era of global warming data that temperatures have blown past the previous record three years in a row. The findings come two days before the inauguration of an American president who has called global warming a Chinese plot and vowed to roll back his predecessorâ€™s efforts to cut emissions of   gases. In reality, the Earth is heating up, a point long beyond serious scientific dispute, but one becoming more evident as the records keep falling. Temperatures are heading toward levels that many experts believe will pose a profound threat to both the natural world and to human civilization. In 2015 and 2016, the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El NiÃ±o, in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere. But the bigger factor in setting the records was the   trend of rising temperatures, which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. â€œA single warm year is something of a curiosity,â€ said Deke Arndt, chief of global climate monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. â€œItâ€™s really the trend, and the fact that weâ€™re punching at the ceiling every year now, that is the real indicator that weâ€™re undergoing big changes. â€ The heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic, with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean. Sea ice in that region has been in precipitous decline for years, and Arctic communities are already wrestling with enormous problems, such as rapid coastal erosion, caused by the changing climate. â€œWhatâ€™s going on in the Arctic is really very impressive this year was ridiculously off the chart,â€ said Gavin A. Schmidt, head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, a unit of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that tracks global temperatures. But Arctic people were hardly alone in feeling the heat. Drought and starvation afflicted Africa. On May 19, the people in the town of Phalodi lived through the hottest day in the recorded history of India, 123. 8 degrees Fahrenheit. El NiÃ±o has now ended, and climate scientists almost universally expect 2017 to be cooler than the year before. But the scale of the heat burst has been startling to many of the experts, and some of them fear an accelerated era of global warming could be at hand over the next few years. Even at current temperatures, billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean. The sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions. Those factors are causing the ocean to rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace, and coastal communities in the United States are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding. Their pleas for help from Congress have largely been ignored. The finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on Wednesday by three government agencies, two of them American and one British, that track measurements made by ships, buoys and   weather stations. They analyze the figures to correct for known problems, producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the Earth. The national meteorological agency of Japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis. In the British data set, 2016 set a record by only a small amount the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASAâ€™s. NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures, and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason. NASAâ€™s calculations suggested that the planet had warmed by well over a   Fahrenheit from 2013 to 2016. That is a huge change for the surface of an entire planet to undergo in just three years, and it appears to be the largest temperature increase over a   period in the NASA record, which begins in 1880. The findings about a   year were also confirmed by the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments. That group, however, did not find that three records had been set in a row in its analysis, 2010 was slightly warmer than 2014. In addition to the surface measurements, satellites are used to measure the temperature of the atmosphere within a few miles of the surface. Two groups that analyze these figures showed a   2016 in data going back to 1978, though in one data set it was a record by only a small margin. Since 1880, NOAAâ€™s records show only one other instance when global temperature records were set three years in a row: in 1939, 1940 and 1941. The Earth has warmed so much in recent decades, however, that 1941 now ranks as only the   year on record. The modern era of global warming began around 1970, after a long stretch of relatively flat temperatures, and the past three years mark the first time in that period that three records were set in a row. Of the 17 hottest years on record, 16 have now occurred since 2000. Two of the agencies that issued Wednesdayâ€™s figures, NOAA and NASA, will soon report to cabinet secretaries appointed by   Donald J. Trump, who has expressed doubt about the findings of climate science. In 2012, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, â€œThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U. S. manufacturing noncompetitive. â€ Fear has erupted within the agencies about whether their data will now be subject to political manipulation. Mr. Trump and his cabinet nominees have given no detailed indication of what their broad climate policies are likely to be, much less how they will manage the scientific enterprise of monitoring the climate. Since he was elected president, Mr. Trump has acknowledged there may be â€œsome connectivityâ€ between human activity and climate change, and he promised to keep an open mind on the subject. On Wednesday, in questioning before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Mr. Trumpâ€™s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, said, â€œI do not believe that climate change is a hoax. â€ He did not, however, say whether he believed that Mr. Trump was wrong on climate change. The three   years in a row undercut longstanding claims by a handful of contrarian scientists that global warming stopped after 1998. That argument was never backed by good statistical evidence, but it was highlighted repeatedly in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail in 2016. When the heat buildup in the ocean is taken into account, global temperatures are rising relentlessly. Scientists have calculated that the heat accumulating throughout the Earth because of human emissions is roughly equal to the energy that would be released by 400, 000 Hiroshima atomic bombs exploding across the planet every day. It is true that at the Earthâ€™s surface, the warming seems to be proceeding in fits and starts. â€œThe arc of global warming will be variously steep and less steep,â€ said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the   Earth Observatory of Columbia University. â€œIt never stopped. â€ In fact, the rate over time has been reasonably close to predictions that scientists first offered decades ago. Those same scientists have long warned that humanity is courting disaster by failing to bring   emissions under control. For example, many experts on sea level believe that a rise of 15 or 20 feet has already become inevitable, though they cannot say how fast it will happen. A rise that large would drown most of the worldâ€™s coastal cities without heroic efforts to fortify them.", "output": "1. True"}

But a large contingent of Democrats continue to feel the Bern, or at least remain very much out of love with Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhich brings us to this past weekend, which proved that sometimes what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas.\n\nThe \"Nevada fracas\" has created a media meme and a conversational focus for the conflict roiling the Democratic Party. That is because it encapsulates the grievances felt on both sides.\n\nSanders supporters see that some of their number were not seated in Las Vegas and see evidence that the system is rigged against them. Clinton supporters hear the epithets hurled at women on that stage, including the state party chair and Sen. Barbara Boxer, and perceive evidence of something else.\n\nOthers will adjudicate what happened in Las Vegas, where both candidates' camps seem to think they were entitled to a majority of delegates. (Although Clinton won the initial round of caucuses back in February, Sanders had the upper hand in an intermediate round at the county level on April 2.)\n\nOne camp wanted an open process; the other wanted respect for the rules. A voice vote was gaveled to a conclusion despite an uncertain outcome, which is bound to cause trouble. But in the end, the party chair herself has come to seem the principal victim â€” \"more sinned against than sinning\" â€” because of extreme phone and online harassment.\n\nNevada's convention seems to have been an egregious case, an outlier. In other states where actual delegates are chosen in several phases, regular order has been followed without a similar outburst.\n\nBut exceptions to the rule often make news. And in this case, cable TV and social media have endlessly repeated the raucous video shot at the convention and the toxic harassment that followed. As Nevada became a national story, Sanders was pressured to respond.\n\nThe candidate has condemned violence generically, but has not apologized for his backers. Instead, Sanders and his retinue have denied responsibility for what happened and doubled down on their long-simmering resentments against Democratic Party officials.\n\nThey say the entire process has been rigged against them, even parts that have been in place for decades. And the implicit message has been: Treat us fairly or expect there to be consequences. When this message is combined with Sanders' vow this week to \"carry our fight to the convention,\" it darkens the portents for the national convention in Philadelphia.\n\nSo what does Bernie want?\n\nLet's start with the obvious: He wants to be nominated and elected. That's understood. Every candidate has a perfect right to continue fighting until the last ballot is cast, as Sanders vows to do.\n\nBut even if he wins California, and several other states on June 7, Sanders would need vertiginous victory margins to win enough delegates to close the pledged delegate gap with Clinton. (The Democrats divide delegates proportionally according to the popular vote, which is just about as democratic a method as you can imagine.)\n\nSo Sanders' one path is to persuade superdelegates to prefer him over Clinton, even though they currently prefer Clinton by more than 10-1. (The only superdelegate to flip so far deserted Sanders for the front-runner.)\n\nSanders and his spokespersons say superdelegates should now ignore the overall vote and the pledged delegate totals and look at how much better Sanders does against Trump in hypothetical November matchups.\n\nThe only problem is that hypothetical tests six months before the election are notoriously unreliable. Just ask President Perot.\n\nMoreover, many of the poll respondents who create this November differential right now are Sanders supporters who say they will shift to Trump in November. The likelihood of their actually doing so is problematic, given past experience with disgruntled backers of other candidates who fell short. (The most recent example would be the Clinton backers in 2008 who swore they would not vote for the man who beat her, Barack Obama, but wound up doing so in the fall.)\n\nSo the \"path to the nomination\" for Sanders is not just uphill, it is essentially vertical.\n\nSo what else might Sanders want?\n\nNo one seems to think Sanders wants to be vice president or have any other role in a Clinton administration. He would return to the Senate, where he would be in a wholly new weight class of political influence.\n\nBut he clearly wants to make a difference, to alter how the Democrats go forward in the fall campaign and beyond.\n\nAnd that is what the Clinton camp must manage. It is entirely possible that the Democratic convention in Philadelphia this July will vote to change party rules, shrinking the number of superdelegates or requiring them to follow the voting results in their states.\n\nIt is also possible, if less likely, that the party would agree to allow more independents a role in its nominating process (although this would still depend on the will of the various states).\n\nSanders supporters will also strive to make the party platform more progressive, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and expanding Medicare to cover people of all ages and perhaps calling for free tuition at public colleges. (The platform already calls for much of Sanders' program regarding the campaign finance system and other issues.)\n\nThis might fall far short of the \"political revolution\" Sanders says his campaign is about. But it could still matter. And it could still point the party toward a far more progressive future.\n\nThat is one way in which the 1988 precedent is relevant. Jesse Jackson arrived in Atlanta with about 30 percent of the delegates (not nearly as many as Sanders will have this summer). At the time, it was easily the best showing for an African-American presidential candidate. And although Jackson was not going to be nominated (Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had a first-ballot majority), his message of racial and economic inclusion was popular and powerful within the party's base.\n\nThe Dukakis forces recognized this and turned the proceedings over to Jackson on the second night of the convention. Thousands of Jackson supporters jammed the arena while delegates, alternates and journalists waited outside â€” unable to enter. Jackson gave an hourlong oration on the theme of common ground, a siege gun speaking for unity.\n\nJackson did his part in the fall, helping Dukakis carry nearly 90 percent of the black vote and 70 percent of the then-minuscule Hispanic vote. Unfortunately for Dukakis, minority voters cast only about one ballot in seven in 1988.\n\nBut by 2012, the share of the vote cast by people of color had nearly doubled. That stunning growth has turned a dozen states that were red in 1988 to blue in 2012 (California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, Maryland, New Mexico, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware and Vermont).\n\nThe same demographic trends have made Florida, Ohio and Colorado toss-ups in presidential elections. All had been solidly Republican in 1988.\n\nSanders' hard base is not among minorities, of course, but among younger voters. His success has been built on winning three-fourths or even more of the voters under age 30. That is a group Clinton will need in the fall just as much as Dukakis needed Jackson's base in 1988.\n\nSanders may not want a Jackson-style prime-time convention session all his own. He might be willing to settle for platform and rules revisions that would validate his campaign. But if he wants a Bernie night in Philadelphia when he can bring his political revolution to life â€” even for a few hours â€” it might be a small price to pay for peace.", "output": "1. True"}

South Korea on Saturday braced for a possible further missile test by North Korea as it marked its founding anniversary, just days after its sixth and largest nuclear test rattled global financial markets and further escalated tensions in the region.  If our participation in talks is desired, I will immediately say yes,  Merkel told Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung in an interview to be published on Sunday. She pointed to negotiations that led to a landmark nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers in 2015. Back then, Germany and the five countries on the United Nations Security Council with veto power took part in talks that led to Iran agreeing to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of most sanctions. Merkel said that was  a long but important time of diplomacy  that ultimately had a  good end  last year, referring to when the deal was implemented.  I could imagine such a format being used to end the North Korea conflict. Europe and especially Germany should be prepared to play a very active part in that,  Merkel added. She said she thought the only way to deal with North Korea s nuclear program was to come to a diplomatic solution, adding:  A new arms race starting in the region would not be in anyone s interests.  Europe should stand united in trying to bring about a diplomatic solution and  do everything that can be done in terms of sanctions , she said. Merkel is expected to win a fourth term in office in a Sept. 24 vote, with polls giving her conservatives a double-digit lead over their rival Social Democrats. Merkel is widely seen in Germany as a safe pair of hands at a time of global uncertainty such as the North Korea crisis, Britain s looming departure from the European Union and Donald Trump s presidency in the United States. Merkel has spoken to leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe about North Korea this week.

Suu Kyi is facing international criticism, including from fellow peace prize winner Desmond Tutu, for not doing more to stop what the U.N. says are mass killings, rapes and the burning of villages taking place in Rakhine state. The violence has forced 421,000 Rohingya Muslims into neighboring Bangladesh. That is a turnaround from 1991, when the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded her the prize and praised  her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights . Once awarded, the prize cannot be withdrawn.  This has happened many times before that laureates have been criticized,  said Professor Geir Lundestad, who was the secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1990 to 2014. Lundestad said the prize remains a force for good, even if some winners later fall short of its ideals:  Aung Sang Suu Kyi was a very important spokeswoman for human rights in Burma and much of Asia. You cannot take that away from her.   The Nobel prizes were established by Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, whose fortune came in part from making and selling arms. The peace prize, worth 9 million Swedish Krona ($1.1 million) will be announced on Oct. 6 and can go to one or more individuals or organizations. A number of winners of the peace prize have gone on to launch wars or escalate them. Israeli leader Menachem Begin ordered the invasion of Lebanon in 1982, four years after sharing the Nobel with Egypt s Anwar Sadat for their Camp David peace accord. Sadat was assassinated by an Islamist army officer in 1981. Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat shared the 1994 prize with Israel s Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres for the Oslo accords, which have not brought a lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Rabin was assassinated by a far-right nationalist in 1995 and Peres was voted out of office eight months later. Arafat later presided over the Palestinians during the second intifada, a violent uprising against Israeli occupation. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, awarded the prize in 1990 for his role in bringing the Cold War to a peaceful end, sent tanks in 1991 to try to stop the independence of the Baltic countries, though he later let them become independent. U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger shared the 1973 prize with North Vietnam s Le Duc Tho for what turned out to be failed efforts to end the Vietnam War. Tho declined the award, the only laureate ever to do so, accusing Washington of violating the truce. The war ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon to the North Vietnamese. When U.S. President Barack Obama won in 2009 just months after taking office, even he said he was surprised. By the time he came to Oslo to collect the prize at the end of the year, he had ordered the tripling of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated,  he said in his speech.  I m responsible for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land. Some will kill, and some will be killed. And so I come here with an acute sense of the costs of armed conflict.  Among Suu Kyi s critics is Tutu who, in a Sept. 7 letter to his  dearly beloved younger sister  writes:  If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep.  On Sept. 19, Suu Kyi condemned rights abuses in Rakhine state and said violators would be punished. While Western diplomats and aid officials welcomed the tone of her message, some doubted if she had done enough to deflect global criticism. Dan Smith, the director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize might even have harmed the Rohingya.   She has an aura,  he said of Suu Kyi, adding that maybe her stellar international reputation  masked the true awfulness  of abuses over many years of the Rohingya.  When she responded to questions about the Rohingya by saying  why are you focusing on them, not on other issues?, people were inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt.  Suu Kyi was the rare winner, like Nelson Mandela, to rise from political prisoner to national leader. Mandela stepped down after five years as South Africa s first black president with his reputation largely unblemished, but some of his allies from the apartheid-era liberation movement faced scandals in office.  Maybe it s this move from the image of the bold, heroic defender of human rights and ordinary people ... into what is inevitably a more grubby world of politics where compromises are made  that tarnishes reputations, said Smith. Even saints face criticism. Mother Teresa, the 1979 Nobel winner canonized by Pope Francis last year, was faulted in 1994 by British medical journal The Lancet for offering neither diagnoses nor strong pain killers to dying patients in her Calcutta hospice. The decision to give the award in 2012 to the European Union was criticized at the time. Brussels was then imposing tough financial bailout conditions on member Greece that many economists said destroyed livelihoods. Tutu, among others, also faulted the EU as an organization that uses military force. The risk of disappointment arises because Nobel committees pick laureates for the hope they carry or a recent achievement, rather than the sum of a career, said Asle Sveen, a historian of the Nobel Peace Prize.  It is a always a risk when they promote somebody, because they are getting involved in politics,  he told Reuters.  And they cannot predict what is going to happen in the future.    That is what makes the Nobel Peace Prize different from all the other peace prizes,  said Sveen.  Otherwise you would give the prize to very old people just before they die.  Among the favorites are parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, such as Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini and John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State at the time. The deal, which saw Iran agree to curbs on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions, has been criticized by hardliners in both Tehran and Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump called it  an embarrassment to the United States  in a speech at the United Nations this month, and has suggested Washington could repudiate it. Experts on the prize say it is precisely the sort of breakthrough among foes that the committee tends to recognize.  This is the first time that a country subjected to Chapter VII (of the U.N. Charter) has seen its situation resolved peacefully,  said Henrik Urdal, Director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, referring to how Iran s nuclear program is no longer labeled a threat by the U.N. Security Council.   Focusing on the EU and Iran would also be a signal to the United States that the Iran nuclear deal has a broad support base,  Urdal told reporters. Other possible contenders are Pope Francis, Syria s  White Helmet  rescue crews, the UN refugee agency UNHCR and its high commissioner Filippo Grandi. UNHCR has already won twice. Last year s prize went to Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos for his efforts to end half a century of war that killed a quarter of million people.", "output": "1. True"}
{"instruction": "Task: Please determine whether the text is 0. False, 1. TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: LONDON  â€”   Patrick Stobbs recently sat in a conference room here playing songs from his smartphone, attempting to show how his   Jukedeck, is at the cutting edge of music. The tune sounded like the soundtrack to a 1980s video game. â€œThis is where we were two years ago,â€ he said, looking slightly embarrassed. â€œAnd this is where we are now,â€ he continued. He then played a gentle piano piece. Its melody was simple, and it was unsubtle in its melancholy, but there was no denying that it could work as background music for, say, a health insurance commercial. Mr. Stobbs didnâ€™t write the music himself, nor did he commission it from a composer. Jukedeck is one of a growing number of companies using artificial intelligence to compose music. Their computers tap tools like artificial neural networks, modeled on the brain, that allow the machines to learn by doing, rather as a child does. So far, at least, these businesses do not seem to be causing much anxiety among musicians. â€œWe see our system as still in its infancy itâ€™s only learnt a certain amount about music,â€ Mr. Stobbs said, although he quickly hinted how he hoped Jukedeckâ€™s music could advance: â€œThereâ€™s no rule of physics that says computers canâ€™t get as good as a human. â€ Having machines write music is not new. In the 1950s, the composer Lejaren Hiller used a computer to produce the â€œIlliacâ€ Suite for string quartet, the first   score. Since then, countless researchers have pushed that work forward. But several   are now trying to commercialize A. I. music for everything from jingles to potential pop hits. Jukedeck, for instance, is looking to sell tracks to anyone who needs background music for videos, games or commercials. The company charges large businesses just $21. 99 to use a track, a fraction of what hiring a musician would cost. Mr. Stobbs wouldnâ€™t reveal how many tracks it has sold, but said that the British division of   pays for a monthly subscription. Tech giants are also involved. In June, Google Brain announced Magenta, a project that aims to have computers produce â€œcompelling and artisticâ€ music, filled with surprises. Its efforts so far do not quite fit the bill. In September, DeepMind, the   British artificial intelligence company, also released results of an experiment it undertook for fun. DeepMind put samples of piano music into its WaveNet system, used to generate audio, such as speech. The system, which was not told anything about how music worked, used the initial audio to synthesize   clips that sound like   jazz. IBM also has a research project called Watson Beat, which musicians will be able to use to transform their workâ€™s style, making songs sound Middle Eastern, for example, or â€œspooky. â€ Jukedeckâ€™s beginnings are somewhat surprising for a tech company. Mr. Stobbs and the composer Ed   both 29, founded it in 2012. They had been choristers at Kingâ€™s College School in Cambridge, England, and Mr.   went on to study music at the University of Cambridge, where he first learned that artificial intelligence could compose. After graduating from Cambridge, the pair set up a choral boy band (â€œa terrible idea,â€ Mr. Stobbs said) and had aspirations to run a record label. But in 2010, Mr.   attended a computer science lecture at Harvard, where his girlfriend was studying. The lecturer made coding sound relatively straightforward, and also made Mr.   recall his earlier studies in A. I. music. He decided to put the two together, and he set about building Jukedeck on the flight home. Jukedeckâ€™s system involves feeding hundreds of scores into its artificial neural networks, which then analyze them so they can work out things like the probability of one musical noteâ€™s following another, or how chords progress. The networks can eventually produce compositions in a similar style, which are then turned into audio, using an automated production program. It has different networks for different styles, from folk to â€œcorporateâ€  â€”   something that sounds like the glossy electronica typically played at business conferences. The company only recently started experimenting with the artificial neural networks for the audio output as well as the composition. This should make tracks sound more natural and varied  â€”   more human, in other words. Other companies working on A. I. music tend to involve musicians more directly in the process. The Sony Computer Science Laboratory in Paris, for example, considers musicians essential to its Flow Machines project, which has received funding from the European Research Council. The idea behind the project is to get computers to write pop hits, said FranÃ§ois Pachet, the laboratoryâ€™s director. â€œMost people working on A. I. have focused on classical music, but Iâ€™ve always been convinced that composing a short, catchy melody is probably the most difficult task,â€ he said. He added: â€œA compelling song is actually a rare and fragile object. It can only work if all the dimensions are right: the melody, the harmony, the voice, the dress of the singer, the discourse around it  â€”   like, â€˜Why did you write this song?â€™ No one is able to model all that right now, and Iâ€™m interested in that problem. â€ Flow Machinesâ€™ main system is a composing tool that works similarly to Jukedeckâ€™s: by getting a computer to analyze scores  â€”   everything from Beatlesâ€™ songs to dance hits  â€”   so that it can learn from them and write its own. However, its output is then given to musicians, who are free to use it, change it or throw it away as they like, at no charge. (Negotiations are underway regarding contractual obligations if record labels release any of this music.) Musicians give â€œa sense of agency,â€ Mr. Pachet said. â€œThe systems donâ€™t know why they want to make music. They donâ€™t have any goal, any desire. â€ Around 20 acts have already used the system, Mr. Pachet said, some performing the songs they wrote using it at a recent concert. He is in talks with some   groups, like the indie band Phoenix, to try it, he added, and several albums will be released this year. Musicians appear to enjoy it. â€œI could never have written a song like the one I did without it,â€ said Mathieu Peudupin, a French rock musician who goes by the name Lescop. â€œIt drove me to a place I would never have gone myself. â€ He said it was like working with a bandmate, although he ignored most of its suggestions. â€œBut what singer in the world listens to his bandmates?â€ he said, laughing. Mr. Pachet and Lescop both said they did not think listeners would ever entirely accept   music. â€œMusic fans need to fall in love with musicians,â€ Lescop said. â€œYou canâ€™t fall in love with a computer. â€ But the founders of Jukedeck are less certain. Mr.   sees artificial intelligence changing the way we listen, especially if computers eventually â€œunderstand music enough to make it respond in real time to, letâ€™s say, a game, or you going for a run,â€ he said. â€œRecorded musicâ€™s brilliant, but itâ€™s static. If youâ€™re playing a game, Hans Zimmer isnâ€™t sitting with you composing. I think responsive systems like that will be a big part of the music of the future. â€", "output": "1. True"}

His client would post a $50 million bond, secured by $10 million in cash. He would stay in a rental apartment in Manhattan and wear a GPS monitoring device. And one more thing: Mr. Zarrab would pay for   guards to ensure that he did not flee and to escort him to and from the courthouse. The request, which a judge is expected to take up on Thursday, is not as unusual as it may seem. The rich are different from everyone else, even those accused of crimes. But a handful of extremely wealthy defendants, particularly those from overseas, are testing courts by proposing to live in   gilded cages while they await their fate. Prosecutors vigorously objected to Mr. Zarrabâ€™s being allowed to face trial under such conditions, telling a federal judge in Manhattan that the proposed plan would allow a rich defendant to build â€œa personal jail for himselfâ€ in a Manhattan apartment, â€œstaffed by a firm on his payroll. â€ â€œZarrabâ€™s proposed bail conditions,â€ the government said, â€œare an attempt to use his tremendous wealth to obscure the flight risk through a facade of security that is beyond the reach of all but a small subset of fabulously wealthy defendants. â€ Mr. Zarrabâ€™s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, has sharply disputed the governmentâ€™s position, saying that at the time of his arrest, Mr. Zarrab was arriving in Miami to visit Disney World with his wife and    daughter, is devoted to his family and charitable causes and is not a threat to flee. Whether Mr. Zarrab succeeds remains to be seen, but other defendants have already been granted release on such terms. Last October, Ng Lap Seng, a Chinese billionaire indicted on charges that he bribed the former president of the United Nations General Assembly, was granted bond of $50 million, secured by $20 million cash and a Midtown apartment where he would be confined and subjected to GPS monitoring and    guards at his own expense. Many thousands of people arrested in New York languish in the cityâ€™s jails because they are unable to make even modest bail. So advocates for prisoners and lawyers for indigent defendants say the idea that some defendants are able to stay out of jail because they have the means to finance a novel confinement plan is blatantly unfair. â€œIt just reinforces for me the point that our entire system of pretrial detention is predominantly based on wealth,â€ said Inimai M. Chettiar, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice who runs an initiative to end mass incarceration. Joshua Norkin, a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society of New York, said the elaborate bail package that was being proposed for Mr. Zarrab and that was granted to Mr. Ng should remind judges in the state court system that they have the tools to release   people â€œon alternative and more creative forms of bail, and theyâ€™re failing to do it. â€ The cases of wealthy defendantsâ€™ receiving special bail conditions are not limited to international defendants. In 2009, Marc S. Dreier, a Manhattan lawyer who pleaded guilty to running an elaborate scheme that defrauded hedge funds and other investors of $700 million, was granted a $10 million bond pending trial and remained in his East Side apartment, secured by electronic monitoring and armed security guards, which his family paid for. Mr. Dreier, prosecutors said, used his criminal proceeds to support a lavish lifestyle, including ownership of the apartment, property in the Hamptons, a valuable art collection and an $18 million yacht. In a written opinion, the judge in the case, Jed S. Rakoff, acknowledged concerns that such an arrangement for Mr. Dreier gave people of means â€œan opportunity for release that poorer people could never obtain. â€ Many kinds of bail conditions favored the rich, Judge Rakoff said, and, conversely, there were many defendants who were too poor to afford even the most modest of bail bonds or financial conditions of release. â€œThis is a serious flaw in our system,â€ he wrote. Still, he added, â€œit is not a reason to deny a constitutional right to someone who, for whatever reason, can provide reasonable assurance against flight. â€ One unusual condition set by Judge Rakoff was that Mr. Dreier had to consent in writing to the use of â€œreasonable forceâ€ by the armed guards in case he tried to flee. Mr. Dreier later was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The debate last fall over Mr. Ngâ€™s bail touched on similar issues. Mr. Ng, a Chinese real estate magnate with a net worth of about $1. 8 billion, owned private airplanes and had passports from at least three countries, the government said. In a bail hearing, a prosecutor, Daniel C. Richenthal, argued that Mr. Ng, who has pleaded not guilty, had no family or other ties in the United States. â€œThere is no reason for him to remain,â€ Mr. Richenthal said. â€œLiterally zero.    bond is meaningless to him $20 million is meaningless to him. â€ The judge, Vernon S. Broderick, ultimately ruled that there were conditions that could assure Mr. Ngâ€™s appearance in court, and, over the governmentâ€™s objection, granted the $50 million bail package, including home confinement with    security, the monitoring of his phone calls and other strict conditions that he detailed in an order. The latest case involves Mr. Zarrab, who has pleaded not guilty to charges that include conspiring to violate the United States sanctions on Iran. The case has been widely watched in Turkey: In 2013, Mr. Zarrab was detained by the Turkish authorities in a broad corruption investigation of businessmen with ties to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then prime minister and now Turkeyâ€™s president. The office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, has asked that the judge, Richard M. Berman, deny bail to Mr. Zarrab, saying evidence of his participation in the charged offenses was â€œoverwhelming,â€ and claiming Mr. Zarrab misled a court officer regarding his international travel and his assets. Mr. Bhararaâ€™s office noted Mr. Zarrab had amassed â€œa considerable fortune,â€ citing evidence of his ownership in about 20 properties, seven sea vessels, 17 luxury automobiles, a private airplane and over $10 million in artwork. Mr. Zarrabâ€™s lawyer, Mr. Brafman, has argued in court papers that his client, who was born in Iran and moved to Turkey as an infant, is not a risk to flee. Mr. Brafman asked the judge not to detain his client â€œsimply because he is wealthy and lacks ties to the United States,â€ and he argued that the bail proposal â€œremoves any possible concern of flight. â€ â€œMr. Zarrab is a husband and a father who is committed to his family,â€ Mr. Brafman wrote, â€œand would not countenance life as a fugitive. â€", "output": "1.

Under the rescue plan, an independent panel would erase some of Puerto Ricoâ€™s $70 billion debt load that has crippled the island state already facing a 45 percent poverty rate and the Zika epidemic. U.S. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, a Republican, has endorsed the fix and the fate of the measure could help define his tenure as party leader which began in October. But Ryan can rely on some Democrats who say the rescue will aid the ailing island even if some of the legislationâ€™s provisions are too punitive of Puerto Rico. â€œThis is the only bill that will attract enough support from our colleagues on the Republican side to pass in a Congress they control,â€ said Rep. Raul Grijalva, the leading Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee. Grijalva of Arizona said he expects lawmakers will ratify the plan when they write the fine-print of the legislation at a hearing on Wednesday. Rep. Rob Bishop, the panelâ€™s chairman, postponed a law-writing session in April because of opposition to the Puerto Rico rescue but on Tuesday he said he was hopeful. Ryan and Democratic leaders stress the aid plan for the island means relief without federal spending though investors will see a cut in their Puerto Rican bond holdings and they are fighting for terms that could limit the hit to their portfolios. A leading voice for investors, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), on Tuesday backed the plan which expects Puerto Rico to control deficit spending. A Puerto Rico oversight panel, or control board, could veto Puerto Rico spending measures that it finds irresponsible and SIFMA endorsed such â€œbroad powers to enforce and monitor fiscal discipline.â€ The oversight board would have the power to push creditors to accept a write-down of debt, even over the objections of holdout investors. The plan would also ask the oversight board to protect the interests of Puerto Rico pensioners who rely on a system that is now under funded by at least $40 billion.", "output": "1. True"}

Roof, a   young white supremacist who killed nine black parishioners last year when he opened fire during a   assault on Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, was found guilty by a federal jury here on Thursday. Mr. Roof, 22, stood, his hands at his side and his face emotionless, as a clerk read the verdict aloud in Federal District Court, where he had been charged with 33 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death. Mr. Roof, whose lawyers conceded his guilt, will face the same jurors when they gather on Jan. 3 to begin a more suspenseful phase of his trial to decide whether he will be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole. The jury deliberated for only about two hours on Thursday afternoon, and as a clerk began to read the guilty verdicts, one after the next, a few women in the courtroom nodded with satisfaction. After the court adjourned, the two adult survivors of the attack, Felicia Sanders and Polly Sheppard, shared a long embrace. â€œI wasnâ€™t expecting anything less,â€ Ms. Sanders told reporters later. â€œI knew it was going to be guilty, guilty, guilty, all the way through. â€ Ms. Sandersâ€™s husband, Tyrone, called Mr. Roof â€œpure evilâ€ as he held his wifeâ€™s hand. â€œMy thoughts were if I could get to him, what would I do,â€ said Mr. Sanders, whose son died in the attack. â€œBut the Lord kept me from charging. â€ The outcome seemed a foregone conclusion from the first minutes of the trial, which began on Dec. 7 and included a swift acknowledgment from the chief defense lawyer, David I. Bruck, that Mr. Roof was responsible for the â€œastonishing, horrible attackâ€ on June 17, 2015. Mr. Roof had chillingly confessed to investigators nearly 18 months earlier and revealed his purpose in a blatantly racist manifesto that he published online. His choice of targets seemed intensely premeditated  â€”   he scouted the church half a dozen times  â€”   although he also researched other black churches and a festival elsewhere in South Carolina before settling on Charleston because, he wrote, it is the â€œmost historic city in my state. â€ Prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed on the basic contours of Mr. Roofâ€™s march toward racial animosity. He belonged to no hate groups and acted alone in Charleston, but they said he had been an avid consumer of racist materials online. â€œYou can easily give him way too much credit for thinking of this stuff if you donâ€™t see where it came from,â€ Mr. Bruck said of Mr. Roof, who had declared in his writings that he had not been â€œraised in a racist home or environment. â€ In a   closing argument, an assistant United States attorney, Nathan S. Williams, depicted Mr. Roof as â€œa man of hatred, a man whoâ€™s proven to be a coward and a man of immense racial ignorance. â€ The prosecutorâ€™s voice often rose in outrage, and the jurors were again shown photographs of the carnage Mr. Roof left behind: blood, bodies, and   tables. â€œHe must be held accountable for each and every action he took in that church,â€ Mr. Williams urged. Mr. Roof has said he intends to represent himself during the penalty phase, so Mr. Bruck, as he has done throughout the trial, did his best on Thursday to suggest that his client was unstable, and thus not fully accountable. Mr. Bruck, who called no witnesses, peppered his closing argument with words like â€œabnormal,â€ â€œdelusional,â€ and â€œsuicidal. â€ Mr. Roof told the F. B. I. in a confession shortly after being arrested that he had saved ammunition to kill himself if, as he expected, he confronted the police when he left Emanuel. The Wednesday night assault on the oldest A. M. E. congregation in the South began less than an hour after Mr. Roof entered through an unlocked side door and took a seat at a weekly Bible study meeting. The congregants, including the churchâ€™s pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, were studying the parable of the sower. When the congregants closed their eyes for a familiar benediction, the sound of gunfire roared through the fellowship hall. When they looked up, they saw Mr. Roof holding a semiautomatic pistol he had bought about two months earlier and concealed in a pack on his waist. Mr. Pinckney was the first wounded, and the churchgoers began diving below the roomâ€™s circular tables. Mr. Roof kept firing, striking the victims at least 60 times. One photo showed a table bearing an opened Bible, a study sheet and an empty magazine. It was one of the most unfathomable racial attacks in decades, and it upended the notion of a postracial America that some had imagined after the election of the countryâ€™s first black president. But fears of street violence eased when family members of five victims appeared at Mr. Roofâ€™s bond hearing less than 48 hours after the killings and expressed forgiveness for the accused. President Obama flew here for Mr. Pinckneyâ€™s memorial service and delivered a eulogy in the form of an indignant and sorrowful meditation on race. This elegant port city where half of all slaves disembarked and the Civil War began soon assumed a mantle of racial healing, although some in the community found the good feelings a superficial papering over of inequities in education, law enforcement and poverty. The victims of the attack at Mother Emanuel, as the church is known, were Mr. Pinckney, Cynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lee Lance, the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor, Tywanza Sanders, the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr. the Rev. Sharonda   and Myra Thompson. The three survivors were Ms. Sanders, Ms. Sheppard and Ms. Sandersâ€™s    granddaughter. During turns on the witness stand, Ms. Sanders and Ms. Sheppard described the havoc that turned a house of worship into a   scene. Ms. Sheppard told jurors that Mr. Roof had approached her and asked whether she was wounded. She was not. â€œIâ€™m going to leave you to tell the story,â€ Mr. Roof replied, according to Ms. Sheppard. Mr. Roof was arrested the next morning in Shelby, N. C. where F. B. I. agents questioned him for about two hours and began to piece together his descent into racist thinking and how, over the course of six months, he planned his assault. But before Mr. Roof spoke of his beliefs, which he had detailed in a handwritten journal and an online manifesto, he admitted to the attack. â€œI did it,â€ Mr. Roof said. The confession served as the centerpiece of the prosecutionâ€™s case. Prosecutors also introduced an array of technical evidence, such as phone records and GPS data, to demonstrate Mr. Roofâ€™s premeditation and document his views on race. He wrote that he mounted the attack in Charleston because no one else would take a stand against what he perceived as an epidemic of    crime and the relegation of white Americans to   status. He called himself a white nationalist, as well as a white supremacist, and said he subscribed to ideologies advanced by Klansmen and Nazis. Mr. Roof wore a jacket bearing patches of the   flags of South Africa and Rhodesia and posed in photographs with the Confederate battle flag. In a consequence that he surely did not anticipate, that flag was removed from the grounds of the South Carolina State House in response to the church killings. The decision to try Mr. Roof was a subject of some dispute because he had offered to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. Ms. Sanders and Ms. Sheppard both supported such an agreement, as did many family members of the victims. But they welcomed the verdict on Thursday, even as they girded for the next round. â€œWe were overjoyed that the jury saw fit to give us this triumph,â€ said the Rev. Sharon Risher, Ms. Lanceâ€™s eldest daughter. â€œIt gives us an opportunity to start the healing process and we just thank God. â€", "output": "1. True"}

The administration would provide small employers tax credits to cover costs.\n\nSenior administration officials said that the package would highlight the presidentâ€™s desire to boost taxes on the nationâ€™s wealthy households and help lower- and middle-class families. New tax credits would help those in need of child care and households with two earners, they said, while other proposals â€” such as covering community college tuition â€” would help students.\n\nThe moves would â€œeliminate the biggest tax loopholes and use the savings to let the middle class get ahead,â€ said one of the senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity during a conference call with reporters to describe the plan before the presidentâ€™s speech. This person also said that 99â€‰percent of the impact of the tax increases would fall on the top 1â€‰percent of earners.\n\nThe ambitious â€” and controversial â€” proposals demonstrate the White Houseâ€™s increasing confidence about the trajectory of the U.S. economy. For the past year and a half, it has debated how much it could trumpet the recovery when so many Americans have not felt any change in their own economic outlook.\n\nBut the plan drew immediate fire from Republican â€” and could face criticism from some Democrats â€” who have in the past increased the amount of money exempt from inheritance taxes they branded â€œdeath taxes.â€ Most Republicans have long opposed increases in capital gains rates, and many favor eliminating the tax altogether.\n\nâ€œThis is not a serious proposal,â€ wrote Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in an e-mail late Saturday. â€œWe lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler, flatter tax code, not big tax increases to pay for more Washington spending.â€\n\nâ€œSlapping American small businesses, savers, and investors with more tax hikes only negates the benefits of the tax policies that have been successful in helping to expand the economy, promote savings, and create jobs,â€ Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said in a statement Saturday night.\n\nâ€œThe president needs to stop listening to his liberal allies who want to raise taxes at all costs and start working with Congress to fix our broken tax code.â€\n\nThe administration tried to head off some of that attack by asserting that elements of the package resembled proposals endorsed by Republicans. Officials also said that the capital gains tax rate was 28â€‰percent during President Ronald Reaganâ€™s terms in office. The Obama administration would also seek to limit the impact of the tax increases by saying the higher capital gains and dividend rates would apply only to couples earning more than $500,000 a year.\n\nOfficials said that the relatively low capital gains tax rate with a top rate of 20â€‰percent has enabled the 400 highest-earning taxpayers â€” with $139â€‰million or more of income â€” to pay an average rate of 17â€‰percent when the top income tax rate is 35â€‰percent.\n\nThe proposal to impose a 7 basis point fee on financial institutions with assets of more than $50â€‰billion will also run smack into opposition from big banks and insurance companies. The administration compared the fee with a proposal by former House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) for an excise tax on large financial institutions. And last week, the House Budget Committeeâ€™s ranking Democrat, Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), proposed a 0.1â€‰percent surcharge on financial market transactions.\n\nOne of the senior administration officials Saturday said that the goal of the proposed fee from the White House was to discourage big financial institutions from excessive borrowing. He said that despite banking revisions after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, highly leveraged financial institutions â€œstill pose risks to the broader economy,â€ adding that â€œthis fee is designed to make that activity more costly.â€\n\nThe economic recovery has freed the president to push for more ambitious domestic policies, many designed to help those in the poor and middle class who are still lagging behind. In the past week alone, Obama has announced new proposals on paid sick leave, free community college tuition and expanded broadband access. And while he might have trouble pushing those through the GOP-controlled Congress, Obama could still end up defining key issues for the elections in 2016.\n\nâ€œThe battle for the next American agenda is already on,â€ said Donald A. Baer, chief executive of Burson-Marsteller and formerly chief speechwriter for President Bill Clinton. â€œThereâ€™s this effort to define a new growth and share agenda â€” growth but not only growth alone, and sharing the growth but not just sharing the wealth.â€ He said Obamaâ€™s college and broadband access are examples of proposals that could add to growth and give poor and middle-class people the tools to increase their share in it.\n\nBut Obama has to balance his rhetoric â€” between optimism and caution â€” by talking up the strong recovery while acknowledging that wage growth remains weak.\n\nâ€œThereâ€™s always been a tension between things are in fact getting better and people are not feeling great,â€ said Wade Randlett, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and major Democratic donor. â€œOne is economic fact, and the other is polling, which always catches up over time.â€\n\nNow the president is so comfortable with the idea of talking up the economic recovery that his advisers have branded it â€” â€œAmericaâ€™s resurgenceâ€ â€” and made it a regular talking point in Obamaâ€™s stump speeches and weekly radio addresses. And it is likely to be a centerpiece of the State of the Union address.\n\nIn bragging about performance, Obama administration officials point to factors including the best streak of job growth since the 1990s, a recovery in the housing market and healthier balance sheets for households, companies and the federal government. And they have contrasted that performance with the anemic economies of Europe and Japan as evidence that the United States has regained its global economic dominance in what Obama has called a â€œbreakthrough year for America.â€\n\nBut wages have been a stubborn reminder of the recoveryâ€™s shortcomings. In November, average hourly private-sector nominal wages inched up 6â€‰cents, but in December, they fell 5 cents. After adjusting for inflation, wages for the entire year crawled up 0.7â€‰percent, a modest amount in an economic recovery. It is a point that has been featured prominently in comments by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has emerged as a leader of the Democratic Partyâ€™s liberal wing.\n\nâ€œIâ€™m feeling better about the economy, but I donâ€™t think we have in place a set of policies that will assure that this recovery will be either sustained or fully inclusive,â€ said Lawrence H. Summers, a former top adviser to Obama, former Treasury secretary and now a professor at Harvard University. â€œThatâ€™s why I think more needs to be done.â€\n\nThe White House typically aims its messages directly at the middle class, but, partly in response to Warren, Obama administration officials are more comfortable talking about how some of its proposals benefit poorer Americans.\n\nâ€œWeâ€™re on offense on minimum wage and the environment,â€ Randlett said. â€œThatâ€™s the kind you only do when you have the leash of good economics.â€", "output": "1.

Podesta was responding to a Politico report that Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had planned to reassess staffing and strategy after the first four primaries but are becoming increasingly critical of their aides and demanded the evaluation sooner. The former secretary of state would be more inclined to add new staff rather than fire current employees, according to the Politico story, which cited six unnamed sources. Clinton, once the clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has lost ground to challenger Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who is expected to win the New Hampshire primary. Last week she narrowly beat Sanders in the Iowa caucuses, the first nominating contest for the Nov. 8 election. Asked by MSNBC about the Politico story, Clinton said: â€œI have no idea what theyâ€™re talking about or who they are talking to.â€ â€œWeâ€™re going to take stock, but itâ€™s going to be the campaign that Iâ€™ve got,â€ Clinton said in the interview with MSNBC. â€œIâ€™m very confident in the people that I have.

Journalists face the issue of how much guidance they should provide to help their audiences make sense of the news. The question is especially keen after the 2016 election when the media grappled with challenging false statements made by Republican Trump in his campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Fifty-nine percent of U.S. adults reject the idea of adding interpretation, saying that the news media should present the facts alone, the survey showed. Four in 10 favored adding some interpretation to the facts. â€œAlthough the public prefers the news media to present â€˜just the facts,â€™ they may not even agree on what the facts are,â€ Pew said in a statement. In the same survey, 81 percent of registered voters said that most supporters of Clinton and Trump not only disagreed over plans and policies, but also disagreed on basic facts. Voters who supported Trump, now the president-elect, favored a â€œjust the factsâ€ approach by 71 percent to 29 percent. Clinton supporters were evenly split on the issue.

But the industry has a Plan B if the New York businessman loses to his more green-minded Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday: carbon capture and storage, a technology that captures carbon dioxide from burning coal and injects it underground, where many scientists are optimistic it cannot contribute to global warming. Coal backers see CCS as a politically feasible solution that could help the next president thread the needle between environmentalists and a once-powerful business that is in desperate need of a lifeline. They have been pushing both major party candidates to embrace it. Staff at the National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative held separate teleconferences with the Clinton and Trump campaigns in August on the merits of a bill that would extend and raise tax breaks for coal and other fossil fuel companies doing CCS in oilfields, from $10 per ton of carbon stored to $35 a ton. NEORI is made up of diverse groups ranging from environmental ogranizations to some of the countryâ€™s largest coal companies. Weeks after the teleconference, Clinton announced her support for the bipartisan CCS bill. Nearly 20 of 100 senators, including Clintonâ€™s vice presidential running mate Tim Kaine, also back it and expect it to gain momentum.      Trump has not given a position on the bill, but a senior policy adviser to Trumpâ€™s campaign, Dan Kowalski, said he â€œsupports all sources of American energy. This includes clean coal and research into new coal technologies.â€  â€œMy sense is Clinton recognizes that, especially in certain parts of the country, coal-based energy and other fossil fuels provide some of the highest-paying jobs in our economy,â€ said Brad Crabtree, of the Great Plains Institute, a policy group that pushes for the deployment technologies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and the parent organization of NEORI. Oil drillers have used CCS since the 1970s, pumping carbon dioxide into aging reservoirs to force out remaining crude. Coal advocates want to expand CCS to coal-fueled power plants. But the business is expensive and needs incentives. Trumpâ€™s anti-regulation stance has made him a clear favorite of the industry, because it suggests lower costs and risks for major producers like Arch Coal Inc, Peabody Energy Corp, Cloud Peak Energy Inc and Alpha Natural Resources Inc. The sector has given about $223,000 in support of Trump, compared with none for Clinton, according to a Reuters analysis of contributions over $200 made by several of the biggest coal companies and their employees. Coal faces a potentially starker future under Clinton. She has promised to build on Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s disputed Clean Power Plan to curb carbon output and suffered political damage earlier this year when she said that by doing so â€œweâ€™re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.â€       Those jobs are already quickly evaporating.  The industry now employs only about 65,000 miners across states like West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Wyoming, down from around 91,000 in 2011, according to the most recent statistics from the U.S. Department of Energy. The countryâ€™s top two biggest coal companies, Arch and Peabody Energy, this year filed for bankruptcy. Neither Trump scrapping federal regulations nor the expanded use of CCS will likely restore the sector, where production last year dropped to the lowest level since 1986, to its previous heights.

Unlike other things that kill us, it often seems to come out of nowhere. But evidence has increasingly accumulated that cancer may be preventable, too. Unfortunately, this has inflamed as much as it has assuaged peopleâ€™s fears. As a physician, I have encountered many people who believe that heart disease, which is the single biggest cause of death among Americans, is largely controllable. After all, if people ate better, were physically active and stopped smoking, then lots of them would get better. This ignores the fact that people canâ€™t change many risk factors of heart disease like age, race and family genetics. People donâ€™t often seem to feel the same way about cancer. They think itâ€™s out of their control. A study published in Science in January 2015 seemed to support that view. It tried to explain why some tissues lead to cancer more often than others. It found a strong correlation between the number of times a cell divides in the course of a lifetime and the risk of developing cancer. In other words, this study argued that the more times DNA replicates, the more often something can go wrong. Some took this to mean that cancer is much more because of â€œbad luckâ€ than because of other factors that people could control. Unfortunately, this simple explanation is not really what the study showed. Lung cells, for instance, divide quite rarely, and still account for a significant amount of cancer. Cells in the gastrointestinal tract divide all the time and account for many fewer cancers. Some cancers, like melanoma, were found to be in the group of cancers influenced more by intrinsic factors (or those we canâ€™t control) when we clearly know that extrinsic factors, like sun exposure, are a major cause. Further, this study was focused more on the relative risks of cancer in one type of tissue versus another. What we really care about is how much we can reduce our own risk of cancer by changing our behavior. A more recent study published in Nature argues that there is a lot we can do. Many studies have shown that environmental risk factors and exposures contribute greatly to many cancers. Diet is related to colorectal cancer. Alcohol and tobacco are related to esophageal cancer. HPV is related to cervical cancer, and hepatitis C is related to liver cancer. And youâ€™d have to be living under a rock not to know that smoking causes lung cancer and that too much sun can lead to skin cancer. Using sophisticated modeling techniques, the researchers argued that less than 30 percent of the lifetime risk of getting many common cancers was because of intrinsic risk factors, or the â€œbad luck. â€ The rest were things you can change. Most recently, in JAMA Oncology, researchers sought to quantify how a healthful lifestyle might actually alter the risk of cancer. They identified four domains that are often noted to be related to disease prevention: smoking, drinking, obesity and exercise. They defined people who engaged in healthy levels of all of these activities as a â€œlow riskâ€ group. Then they compared their risk of getting cancer with people who werenâ€™t in this group. They included two groups of people who have been followed and studied a long time, the Nursesâ€™ Health Study and the Health Professionals   Study, as well as national cancer statistics. Of the nearly 90, 000 women and more than 46, 000 men, 16, 531 women and 11, 731 men fell into the   group. For each type of cancer, researchers calculated a   risk, which is the percentage of people who develop cancer who might have avoided it had they adopted   behaviors. About 82 percent of women and 78 percent of men who got lung cancer might have prevented it through healthy behaviors. About 29 percent of women and 20 percent of men might have prevented colon and rectal cancer. About 30 percent of both might have prevented pancreatic cancer. Breast cancer was much less preventable: 4 percent. Over all, though, about 25 percent of cancer in women and 33 percent in men was potentially preventable. Close to half of all cancer deaths might be prevented as well. No study is perfect, and this is no exception. These cohorts are overwhelmingly white and consist of health professionals, who are not necessarily like the population at large. But the checks against the national data showed that if anything, these results might be underestimating how much cancer is preventable by healthy behaviors. This also isnâ€™t a randomized controlled trial, and we can certainly argue that it doesnâ€™t prove causation. A bigger concern to me is that people might interpret these findings as assigning fault to people who get cancer. You donâ€™t want to get into situations where you feel as if people donâ€™t deserve help because they didnâ€™t try hard enough to stay healthy. Much of cancer is still out of peopleâ€™s control. I was especially worried because, in this study, â€œlow riskâ€ status required all four healthy lifestyles. Failing in any one domain put you in the   category, and that seemed like a lot to ask of people. On further reading, though, I discovered that the requirements werenâ€™t overly burdensome. Not smoking was defined as never having smoked or having quit at least five years ago. Thatâ€™s clearly good for health. Moderate alcohol consumption was defined as no more than one drink a day on average for women, and no more than two for men. Thatâ€™s pretty much what I have argued for in writing about this issue in the past it in no way requires abstinence. Adequate weight was defined as a B. M. I. of at least 18. 5 and no more than 27. 5. The cutoff for â€œoverweightâ€ is 25, meaning that you donâ€™t have to be thin you just have to be less than obese (B. M. I. 30). Finally, exercise was defined as 150 minutes a week of   activity or 75 minutes of   activity. Thatâ€™s a reasonable and quite achievable goal. I was surprised to realize that Iâ€™m already â€œlow risk. â€ I bet many people reading this are â€œlow risk,â€ too. As we talk about cancer â€œmoonshotsâ€ that will most likely cost billions of dollars and might not achieve results, itâ€™s worth considering that  â€”   as in many cases  â€”   prevention is not only the cheapest course, but also the most effective. Simple changes to peopleâ€™s behaviors have the potential to make sure many cancers never occur. They have a side benefit of preventing health problems in many other areas, too. Investment in these efforts may not be as exciting, but it may yield greater results.", "output": "1. True"}

The proposal to increase military spending by $54 billion and cut nonmilitary programs by the same amount was unveiled by White House officials as they prepared the presidentâ€™s plans for next yearâ€™s federal budget. Aides to the president said final decisions about Medicare and Social Security would not be made until later in the year, when he announces his full budget. But Sean Spicer, his spokesman, cited Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign commitments about protecting those programs and vowed that â€œheâ€™s going to keep his word to the American people. â€ In effect, Mr. Trump appears determined to take sides in a generational struggle between older, sicker Americans who depend on the entitlement programs, and their younger, poorer counterparts whose livelihoods are shaped by the domestic programs likely to see steep cuts. He also set up a battle for control of Republican Party ideology with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who for years has staked his   reputation on the argument that taming the budget deficit without tax increases would require that Congress change, and cut, the programs that swallow the bulk of the governmentâ€™s spending  â€”   Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. â€œI donâ€™t know how you take $54 billion out without wholesale taking out entire departments,â€ said Bill Hoagland, a longtime Republican budget aide in the Senate and now a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. â€œYou need to control it in the area of the entitlement programs, which heâ€™s taken off the table. It is a proposal, I dare say, that will be dead on arrival even with a Republican Congress. â€ Speaking to governors at the White House, Mr. Trump said his spending demands would be at the core of the speech he gives Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress. â€œThis budget follows through on my promise to keep Americans safe,â€ he said, calling it a â€œpublic safety and national securityâ€ budget that will send a â€œmessage to the world in these dangerous times of American strength, security and resolve. â€ In the first part of the speech, Mr. Trump will recount â€œpromises made and promises kept,â€ said the aides, who requested anonymity during a briefing with reporters. The rest of the speech will focus on how he will help people with their problems and how he intends to protect the nation. The presidentâ€™s budget proposals  â€”   which were short on detail but are said to exempt not just Medicare and Social Security but also veteransâ€™ benefits and law enforcement efforts  â€”   would lead to deep reductions in federal programs that touch millions of lives. The White House signaled that it would begin with agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service and social   programs. A budget with no entitlement cuts and one that does not balance most likely has no chance of passing the House, and could be rejected by Senate Republicans as well. Mr. Trumpâ€™s proposals are too far to the right in terms of domestic cuts and too far to the left in terms of balance. Their failure could have practical implications for the White House. If Congress fails to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, Mr. Trumpâ€™s promise to drastically rewrite the tax code could also die, since the president was counting on that budget resolution to include special parliamentary language that would shield his tax cuts from a Democratic filibuster. Without it, any tax legislation would have to be bipartisan enough to clear the Senate with 60 votes. But beyond legislative considerations, the fate of Mr. Trumpâ€™s proposal will go a long way toward determining how significantly his brand of economic populism has changed Republican orthodoxy. Mr. Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that Republican promises to transform Medicare and slash entitlement spending were the reason the party lost the White House in 2012, helpfully   Mr. Ryan, who sat at the bottom of the ticket that year, in his analysis. Social Security, health care and net interest now comprise nearly 60 percent of all federal spending, and that figure is expected to soar to 82 percent over the next 10 years. â€œPaul Ryanâ€™s budget plans with cuts to Social Security and Medicare are not that popular with most voters, and what helped elect Donald Trump was the promise not to cut benefits and programs,â€ said Douglas Elmendorf, the recently departed director of the Congressional Budget Office and current dean of Harvardâ€™s John F. Kennedy School of Government. â€œThat is an unresolved tension. â€ White House officials said the broad outlines of a spending plan represented the logical culmination of Mr. Trumpâ€™s efforts to make good on his campaign pledges to prune what he considers wasteful government spending even as he expands what he considers an underfunded military. â€œIt will show the president is keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do,â€ said Mick Mulvaney, the presidentâ€™s budget director. â€œWe are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars. â€ Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers said aid to foreign governments, which makes up a tiny fraction of federal spending, was one such target. The budget for the I. R. S. which was the target of Republican criticism during Barack Obamaâ€™s administration, would be slashed by 14 percent, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provides grants for community banks and local development, would be all but eliminated. The White House blueprint calls for a 24 percent cut to the E. P. A. â€™s budget, according to a person who had seen the document but was not authorized to speak on the record. That would amount to a reduction of about $2 billion from the agencyâ€™s annual budget of about $8. 1 billion, reducing its spending to levels not seen since Ronald Reaganâ€™s presidency. But it is far from clear whether Congress will approve such steep cuts in popular programs. While congressional Republicans have long targeted the E. P. A. â€™s regulatory authority, they are also aware that about half the agencyâ€™s annual budget is passed through to popular   programs, like converting abandoned industrial sites into sports stadiums and other public facilities, which lawmakers of both parties are loath to cut. And most of the agencyâ€™s federal office spending goes toward funding programs that are required by existing laws. Last year, even as congressional Republicans railed against the Obama administrationâ€™s E. P. A. regulations, they proposed cutting only $291 million from the agencyâ€™s budget. Environmental advocates denounced the proposed cuts, saying they would devastate environmental protection and public health programs while doing little to increase national security. â€œThe assault on human health begins now with President Trumpâ€™s plan to slash the E. P. A. â€™s resources, which are vital to protecting Americansâ€™ drinking water and air from pollution,â€ said Scott Faber, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group. But the information to emerge about the budget raises more questions than it answers. Democrats, of course, will be no friend, either. â€œDemocrats will make crystal clear the misplaced priorities of the administration and the Republican majority,â€ said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the   Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, â€œand we will fight tooth and nail to protect services and investments that are critical to   American families and communities across the country. â€ But the budget may be the most striking example in Mr. Trumpâ€™s young presidency of the ways in which he is challenging the orthodoxy of his own party. Since the start of his insurgent campaign, Mr. Trump has opposed the Republican Partyâ€™s   positions on a range of policies, including free trade, how to deal with Russia and the future of government entitlement programs. Republicans in Congress had hoped that the influence of the two former Republican House members in Mr. Trumpâ€™s cabinet  â€”   Tom Price, head of health and human services, and Mr. Mulvaney  â€”   would have led to new conclusions about the need to address entitlement programs that are swelling drastically with baby boomersâ€™ retirement. Instead, Mr. Trump appears intent on extracting the savings he needs for military spending from the one part of the budget already most squeezed, domestic discretionary spending.", "output": "1.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: INDIANAPOLIS  â€”   Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, desperate to alter the course of a presidential primary fight in which Donald J. Trump is closing in on victory, announced Wednesday that Carly Fiorina would be his running mate if he won the Republican nomination. The move, a day after Mr. Trump scored unexpectedly wide victory margins in sweeping five East Coast states, amounted to the grandest diversionary tactic a presidential candidate can stage  â€”   or at least the grandest one available to a candidate trailing by about  400 delegates who failed to win more than 25 percent of the vote in any state on Tuesday. Taking the stage after 4 p. m. before a modest but spirited crowd in a cavernous pavilion here, Mr. Cruz described Mrs. Fiorina, the former presidential candidate and   chief executive, as â€œbrilliant and capableâ€ and deeply principled, and praised her for having â€œshattered glass ceilings. â€ Mr. Cruzâ€™s criteria for a pick, in his telling, seemed to be aimed squarely at Mr. Trump. â€œDo they think through decisions in a rash and impulsive way?â€ he asked. â€œDo they pop off the handle at whatever strikes them at any given moment?â€ He held up Mrs. Fiorina as someone who knows â€œwhere jobs come from. â€ â€œBorn in Texas,â€ he added, grinning, â€œthe very first thing I liked about her. â€ Mr. Cruzâ€™s decision to rush out a   pick before next weekâ€™s primary in Indiana, which is becoming    for his candidacy, was the political equivalent of a student pulling a fire alarm to avoid an exam: It was certain to draw attention and carried the possibility of meeting its immediate goal, but seemed unlikely to forestall the eventual reckoning. Still, for Mr. Cruz, it could serve to shift the focus away from Mr. Trumpâ€™s success and from his own wheezing alliance with Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who agreed to clear out of Indiana if Mr. Cruz withdrew from competition in Oregon and New Mexico. And since endorsing Mr. Cruz last month, Mrs. Fiorina has proved to be an eager surrogate, attacking both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton with zeal. On Wednesday, Mrs. Fiorina quickly seized on the role of faithful sidekick, singing a song to Mr. Cruzâ€™s daughters from the stage, appraising the senator as â€œa lot of funâ€ and repeatedly hammering home the Cruz campaign argument that Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are essentially indistinguishable on policy. â€œTheyâ€™re not going to challenge the system,â€ she said. â€œThey are the system. â€ Mr. Cruzâ€™s announcement was prompted by the same countervailing forces that pushed him to strike the nonaggression pact with Mr. Kasich on Sunday: Mr. Cruzâ€™s polling in Indiana showed him down   in Indiana last week, according to two Republicans familiar with the findings. He has edged closer to Mr. Trump in nightly surveys this week, but remains behind. â€œIf the election were held today, weâ€™d lose but not get crushed,â€ said a Republican familiar with Mr. Cruzâ€™s polling. What is striking, though, is that Mr. Cruz decided to tap Mrs. Fiorina even after his own surveys indicated she would offer only a modest boost. In Indiana and subsequent states, Mr. Cruzâ€™s campaign tested the impact if Mr. Cruz named Mrs. Fiorina as his running mate and found it was only worth â€œa couple of points,â€ said a Republican briefed on the polling results. â€œVoters like her. They donâ€™t love her,â€ said this Republican, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the  . Yet Mr. Cruzâ€™s gambit may present a perilous challenge for Mr. Trump, who faces mounting criticism for his derisive remarks about women, including his repeated claims that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s sole political asset is â€œthe womanâ€™s card. â€ Already viewed unfavorably by a majority of women in general election polls, Mr. Trump has clashed savagely with Mrs. Fiorina in the past. He has mocked her business record, her voice and even her looks. â€œLook at that face,â€ Mr. Trump said in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine last summer. â€œWould anyone vote for that?â€ Another slashing comment directed at Mrs. Fiorinaâ€™s appearance or gender could have grave consequences for Mr. Trump, especially with female voters he would need to win over to compete in the fall. Current and former advisers to Mr. Trump said he has long found Mrs. Fiorina an agitating presence and described her in public and private as an unworthy opponent with dubious business credentials. And Mr. Trump has repeatedly disregarded advisers who urged him steer clear of conflict with a comparatively obscure rival, no matter how fervent his distaste for her. Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who was dismissed from the campaign last summer, said Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers warned him that his treatment of Mrs. Fiorina would be perceived as a test of his discipline for the general election. â€œWe had already anticipated that there would be attacks of sexism, that there would be attacks that you donâ€™t respect women,â€ said Mr. Nunberg, who now opposes Mr. Trump, paraphrasing the Trump campaignâ€™s counsel to the candidate. â€œThis was a major test to show you can compete as a presidential candidate. â€ Mr. Nunberg added, â€œUnfortunately, Donald failed that test miserably. â€ For Mr. Cruz, the drawbacks to naming Mrs. Fiorina are many: A pick designed to change momentum in a primary could prove less than optimal for a general election. Voters might find it presumptuous for a candidate to name his prospective running mate while trailing by several hundred delegates. Then there are the taunts from Mr. Trump. â€œHeâ€™s wasting his time,â€ the   told reporters Tuesday night, when asked about Mr. Cruzâ€™s preparations for a possible selection. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump responded dismissively to reports of a   ticket: On Twitter he posted a clip of Mrs. Fiorina on television, earlier in the campaign, calling Mr. Cruz a politician who â€œsays whatever he needs to say to get elected. â€ (A â€œsuper PACâ€ supporting Mr. Kasich circulated a memo listing Mrs. Fiorinaâ€™s past criticisms of Mr. Cruz in greater detail.) For those inclined to cast Mr. Cruzâ€™s   Senate tenure as a triumph of principle, the selection and its unusual timing could register as the kind of unconventional move of a Republican who has made a career of bucking the partyâ€™s establishment. But among Republicans in Washington, where skirmishes with Mr. Cruz have focused more often on tactics than policy substance, the maneuver appeared likely to reinforce the perception among his detractors that he is cynical and calculating. Either way, in Mrs. Fiorina, Mr. Cruz has turned to a credible outsider and an expert attack dog who has sparred often with the senatorâ€™s rivals in both parties. She will surely be deployed in California, where the June 7 primary could determine whether Mr. Trump captures the delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the convention. Mrs. Fiorina has statewide political experience there, having been the Republican nominee against Senator Barbara Boxer in 2010. Her connections with the sort of party activists likely to vote in the primary there could give Mr. Cruz a valuable surrogate in the weeks leading up to it. She did, however, lose her one California campaign by 10 points and has since left the state to live in the Virginia suburbs of Washington. Mindful of the gender gap often evident in Mr. Trumpâ€™s polling, Cruz allies hope that Mrs. Fiorina will prove a capable foil to him, as she did while besting him in a series of debate exchanges during her own candidacy. In recent weeks, she has again relished the role, disparaging Mr. Trump in interviews and urging him to â€œman upâ€ and debate Mr. Cruz   . She has also shown a habit of answering questions addressed to Mr. Cruz at news conferences, interjecting to sing his praises or defend his actions. In the past, though, Mrs. Fiorina has chafed at being described as   material. Last year, she called it â€œsexistâ€ that she was often asked whether she was running for president in the hopes of being chosen as someoneâ€™s running mate. More recently, she had hedged when asked about her interest. As Mrs. Fiorina sat beside Mr. Cruz for a Fox News interview last month, the Texas senator was asked whether he would consider Mrs. Fiorina for the role. A live audience cheered, and Mrs. Fiorina answered before Mr. Cruz could. â€œLetâ€™s win the nomination first,â€ she said. Mr. Cruzâ€™s selection of Mrs. Fiorina was also reminiscent of a candidate whom he revered. In his 1976 primary against President Gerald R. Ford, Ronald Reagan  â€”   lagging and needing to change the subject  â€”   announced his choice of a running mate before the Republican convention. The gamble paid off in the short term. His selection of Senator Richard S. Schweiker of Pennsylvania led the evening news, slowed the news mediaâ€™s rush to declare Ford the presumptive nominee and allowed Reagan to continue wooing delegates. But Reaganâ€™s announcement came after the primaries had ended, not with 10 states remaining, and he was closer behind Ford in the delegate count than Mr. Cruz is today to Mr. Trump. Mr. Schweiker carried the promise of winning over a clear constituency, the Pennsylvania delegation, while it is unclear which voters Mrs. Fiorina could deliver. And Reagan still lost to Ford.", "output": "1. True"}

The proposal would unbind Republican delegates from how citizens in various states voted and allow them to vote instead based on their personal consciences.\n\nFor weeks, members of the rules committee had been urged to support this rebel effort. One delegate said she had received some 400 emails urging her to support the so-called conscience clause.\n\nIt all converged late Thursday night, after an exhausting day of mind-numbing, obscure rules changes. Then came the dramatic moment, a vote that one 40-year rules committee veteran said had \"obviously been the subject of more pre-convention publicity than any rules matter ever in living memory.\"\n\nThe incessant campaign of the anti-Trump rebellion rankled some of the delegates committed to the New York businessman. â€œThe people who sent all those emails: Itâ€™s over, folks,â€ proclaimed Iowa delegate Steve Scheffler while the committee debated the proposal. â€œLetâ€™s get behind our nominee right now.â€\n\nThe results were disastrous: Not only did the #NeverTrump delegates lose on their issue by an overwhelming number, but the Republican delegates voted to strengthen the binding of delegates.\n\nUsing procedures to their advantage, pro-Trump forces on the committee shut down the #NeverTrump effort with ease. In the end, the anti-Trump delegates failed event to get a tallied vote on the â€œconscience clauseâ€â€”they were shouted down in a voice vote. They were denied even the chance to debate the initiative.\n\nâ€œThis angst isnâ€™t going to go away just because we paper over it with rules,â€ said Sen.

Under their interpretation of party rules, delegates have always been free to vote their conscience.\n\nThe #NeverTrump movementâ€™s last chance to stop Trump will be through a last-minute challenge on the convention floor, when state delegations participate in the official vote for the presidential nomination.\n\nUsually, each state delegation chairperson simply announces the state delegatesâ€™ vote count, as it has been pre-assigned by party rules.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: On a muggy afternoon in April, Angelina Iles, 65, folded herself into my passenger seat and took me on a tour of her beloved Pineville, La. a sleepy town smack in the middle of the low, wet state. We drove past     houses and   businesses  â€”   shuttered restaurants, a decrepit gas station  â€”   as Iles, an   retired lunchroom worker and community activist, guided me toward the muddy banks of the Red River. Near there stands the   Art Deco shell of the Huey P. Long hospital, which once served the poorest of the poor in Rapides Parish  â€”   and employed more than 300 workers. When employers leave towns like Pineville, they often do it with a deaf ear to the pleading of state and local governments. But in the case of Huey P. Long, the employer was the government itself. Its demise began, arguably, in 2008, when Bobby Jindal was swept into the Louisiana governorâ€™s mansion on a     platform, promising to modernize the state and unleash the power of American private industry along the Gulf Coast. At the time, Louisiana was flush with federal funds for Hurricane Katrina reconstruction and running a budget surplus. Jindal and the State Legislature slashed income taxes and started privatizing and cutting. This was a source of great pride for Jindal. During his failed bid for the presidency last year, he boasted that bureaucrats are now an endangered species in Louisiana. â€œIâ€™ve laid off more of them than Trump has fired people,â€ he said, â€œand Iâ€™ve cut my stateâ€™s budget by more than heâ€™s worth. â€ He laid off more than just bureaucrats. Jindal cut appropriations for higher education, shifting the cost burden onto students themselves. (State spending per student was down more than 40 percent between 2008 and 2014 just one state, Arizona, cut more.) And he shuttered or privatized nine charity hospitals that served the stateâ€™s uninsured and indigent. They were outdated and costly, Jindal argued, and private management would improve access, care and the bottom line. Huey P. Long was one of those hospitals. Iles, along with dozens of other workers and activists, helped organize a protest against the cuts, she told me. They held a vigil on the hospitalâ€™s front lawn. Iles even helped produce an   documentary called â€œBad Medicineâ€ that was broadcast on local television. But it was all for naught. â€œThe good governor did not want to listen to us,â€ Iles said, checking her constantly buzzing phone in the car. The hospital closed its doors in 2014, and its patients were redirected to other local medical centers and clinics. All of the hospitalâ€™s workers lost their jobs. Driving around Pineville, Iles and I dropped in on a friend of hers from church, Theresa Jardoin, 68, who worked in the hospital for 41 years, most recently as an EKG supervisor. Out of work, she spends most of her days at home, taking care of her family. Earlier, Iles had introduced me to another friend, Linette Richard, whose story was similar. She had been working as an ultrasound technician when the hospital closed. She lost much of what she had been expecting for her retirement, because she had not been there long enough. â€œNobodyâ€™s jumping to hire a    especially in my field,â€ Richard said. â€œYou can get a   job, like McDonaldâ€™s or Burger King. But higher up? We donâ€™t have positions available. Thatâ€™s the way it is. â€ Thatâ€™s the way it is across much of Louisiana. The state has added 80, 000 new jobs since the Great Recession officially ended in 2009. But at the same time, jobs have been shrinking at every level of government, with local offices losing 10, 600 workers, the state government 31, 900 and the federal government 1, 600. Louisiana is an exaggerated case, but the pattern persists when you look at the country as a whole. Since the recession hit, private employers have added five million jobs and the government has lost 323, 000. The country has recovered from the recession. But public employment has not. The public sector has long been home to the sorts of jobs that lift people into the middle class and keep them there. These are jobs that have predictable hours, stable pay and protection from arbitrary layoffs, particularly for those without college or graduate degrees. Theyâ€™re also more likely to be unionized less than 7 percent of   workers are represented by a union, while more than a third of those in the public sector are. In other words, they look like the   jobs our middle class was built on during the postwar years. The public sectorâ€™s slow decimation is one of the unheralded reasons that the middle class has shrunk as the ranks of the poor and the rich have swollen in the   years. This is certainly true in Louisiana, where five of the 10 biggest employers are public institutions, or health centers that in no small part rely on public funds. In Rapides Parish, which includes Pineville, the biggest employer is the school district. Across the country, when   workers lose their jobs, the burden disproportionately falls on black workers, and particularly women  â€”   people like Theresa Jardoin and Linette Richard. â€œWe felt middle class,â€ Richard told me. â€œNow we feel kind of lower. â€ In the middle of the last century, a series of legal and legislative decisions  â€”   fueled by and fueling the civil rights movement  â€”   increased the number of black workers in government employment. F. D. R. ended official discrimination in the federal government and in companies engaged in the war effort Truman desegregated the armed forces Kennedy established the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and Johnson signed an executive order banning discrimination by federal contractors. As a result, black workers gained more than a quarter of new federal jobs created between 1961 and 1965. And the share of government jobs held by women climbed 70 percent between 1964 and 1974, and nearly another 30 percent by the early 1980s. Through the middle of the century, the wage gap between white and black workers narrowed as social forces and political pressure compelled private businesses to open up better jobs to black workers. â€œ  work has been a backbone of the black middle class for many reasons,â€ says Mary Pattillo, a sociologist at Northwestern who studies race and class. Affirmative action helped bring marginalized groups into the public work force there, they benefited from more public scrutiny of employment practices. â€œThe inability to fire people in a   fashion has likely protected   who are perhaps likely to be fired in a   fashion,â€ she says. As of 2007, black workers were 30 percent more likely than workers of other races to be employed in the public sector. For any number of reasons, the Great Recession unraveled much of the progress made by the black middle class. Leading up to the mortgage crisis, black families tended to have a higher proportion of their wealth tied up in their homes. And regardless of their income, black families were much more likely to be rejected for conventional mortgages and pushed into   subprime loans. All of this meant that when housing prices turned down, the   wealth gap yawned. As of 2013, white households were, on average, 13 times wealthier than black households, the biggest gap since 1989, according to Pew Research Center data. Declining tax revenue led to tightened state budgets, which led to tens of thousands of layoffs for   employees. And during the recovery, public workers became easy political targets precisely because of their labor protections.   rights, pension funds and mandatory raises look like unnecessary drains on state coffers to a work force increasingly unfamiliar with such benefits. And when the layoffs came, black Americans experienced a disproportionate share of the ill effects. A graduate student of sociology at the University of Washington, Jennifer Laird, wrote a widely cited dissertation, examining the effects of   layoffs on different races. She found that the   unemployment rate climbed more for black men than for white men  â€”   and much more for black women than for white women, with the gap between the two groups soaring from less than a percentage point in 2008 to 5. 5 percentage points in 2011. â€œIt may be that black workers are more likely to be laid off when the layoffs are triggered by a sudden and significant reduction in funding,â€ she wrote. â€œWhen the number of layoff decisions increases, managers have more opportunities to discriminate. â€ Worse, once unemployed, black women were â€œthe least likely to find   employment and the most likely to make a full exit from the labor force. â€ As a result of all these economic punishments, a recession that set America back half a decade may have set black families back a whole generation, if not longer. And because the public sector provides so many essential services, cuts to it have a cascading effect. Hospitals close, and people have to drive farther away for medical care. Teachersâ€™ aides lose their positions, and local kids no longer have the same degree of   attention. Angelina Iles, the retiree I met in Pineville, cited the loss of dental,   and emergency medical services as being a particularly profound problem for her community. Other states and towns are electing to have smaller public work forces. Wisconsin, for instance, has thinned its ranks of government workers by some 5, 000 since its Republican governor, Scott Walker, led a push to abrogate public workersâ€™ organizing rights  â€”   a political choice with profound economic and racial ramifications. â€œThey try to say that collective bargaining is a drain on the economy, when it provides the ability and opportunity for folks to have a seat at the table,â€ Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, told me. And the economic evidence does show that a higher concentration of unionized workers increases intergenerational mobility and raises wages for all workers, public and private. With time, government jobs should come back that pathway to the middle class should grow again. â€œGovernment jobs are always slower to come back after a recession,â€ says Roderick Harrison, a former Howard University demographer. It takes time for private businesses to rehire workers. It takes time for tax revenue to rise to a level at which cities and states feel comfortable adding public workers back onto their payrolls. â€œThat means that the portion of the black middle class that was dependent on government jobs  â€”   police, schools, emergency workers and so on  â€”   is going to take longer to recoup and regain whatever positions they had,â€ he says. For Pineville, that recovery might come too late for many of its workers, especially those who were looking toward retirement. Because Linette Richard canâ€™t find suitable work, she and her husband get by on what he makes as a car salesman. She has given up trying to find work again around Pineville. So has Theresa Jardoin, who has resigned herself to a tougher retirement than she thought she would enjoy. â€œAll of a sudden, thereâ€™s nothing,â€ she said, sitting in an easy chair in her living room, just blocks from Huey P. Long, playing with her granddaughterâ€™s hair. â€œYou canâ€™t enjoy retirement in this situation. â€ â€œYou didnâ€™t even get a pocket watch, did you?â€ Iles asked. â€œNo,â€ Jardoin said, with a resigned laugh. â€œJust aches and pains. â€", "output": "1.

Mrs. Trumpâ€™s suit, filed on Monday in a New York State court, accuses The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, of libel for reporting last year on claims that a modeling agency she worked for in the 1990s was also an escort service. The new complaint does not refer explicitly to the White House or Mr. Trump, or even her status as a candidateâ€™s wife when the article was published and now as first lady. Instead, it refers to opportunities she had â€œto launch a   commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multimillion dollar business relationships for a multiyear term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world. â€ Because of the Daily Mail article, it says, â€œplaintiffâ€™s brand has lost significant value,â€ greatly reducing those opportunities. It claims $150 million in damages. A spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump said she was not trying to make money from her role as first lady. Mr. Trump has fended off criticism that his business dealings around the world create conflicts of interest in his official role, and he has put his adult sons in charge of his businesses rather than sell his assets or put them into a blind trust. On the day he took office, the White House altered its online biography of Mrs. Trump, after complaints that the original wording promoted her line of jewelry. The Daily Mail published its article on Mrs. Trump on Aug. 20, quoting from a report in a magazine in Slovenia, Mrs. Trumpâ€™s native country, and a book about her. She and her representatives have insisted that the claims it repeated are false. On Sept. 1, Mrs. Trump sued The Daily Mail in a state court in Montgomery County, Md. and on the same day, the tabloid published a retraction. Last week, the Maryland court dismissed the case, saying it did not have jurisdiction. The new case against Mail Media, a corporation that operates the Daily Mailâ€™s website, was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, where the company has offices. Mrs. Trump also sued a Maryland blogger, Webster Tarpley, who published claims like those cited by The Daily Mail. She settled that case on Tuesday, and her lawyer, Charles J. Harder, said in a statement that Mr. Tarpley had agreed to pay Mrs. Trump â€œa substantial sum as a settlement. â€", "output": "1. True"}

Comey, on Tuesday recommended no criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state, lifting an enormous legal cloud from her presidential campaign less than two hours before she boarded Air Force One for her first joint campaign appearance with President Obama. But on a day of political high drama in Washington, Mr. Comey rebuked Mrs. Clinton as being â€œextremely carelessâ€ in using a private email address and server. He raised questions about her judgment, contradicted statements she has made about her email practices, said it was possible that hostile foreign governments had gained access to her account, and declared that a person still employed by the government  â€”   Mrs. Clinton left the State Department in 2013  â€”   could have faced disciplinary action for doing what she did. To warrant a criminal charge, Mr. Comey said, there had to be evidence that Mrs. Clinton intentionally transmitted or willfully mishandled classified information. The F. B. I. found neither, and as a result, he said, â€œour judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. â€ The Justice Department is highly likely to accept the F. B. I. â€™s guidance, which a law enforcement official said also cleared three top aides of Mrs. Clinton who were implicated in the case: Jake Sullivan, Huma Abedin and Cheryl D. Mills. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said last week that she would accept the recommendation of the F. B. I. and career prosecutors in the case after a storm of criticism about an impromptu meeting between her and former President Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix. Mr. Comeyâ€™s   announcement, delivered with no advance warning only three days after his investigators interviewed Mrs. Clinton in the case, riveted official Washington and is likely to reverberate for the rest of the campaign. In offices across the capital, all eyes turned to television screens to hear the outcome of a yearlong investigation that could have thrown the 2016 presidential election into disarray and changed history. As Mr. Comey strode to the lectern at the F. B. I. headquarters at 11 a. m. Mrs. Clinton was waiting backstage a few blocks away to address the National Education Association. Her aides said she did not know what Mr. Comey was going to say. Five minutes into Mr. Comeyâ€™s remarks, and before he announced that the F. B. I. would not seek charges, a smiling Mrs. Clinton began her speech. By 2:45 p. m. she and Mr. Obama were descending the stairs of Air Force One for a campaign rally in Charlotte, N. C. while back in Washington the State Department spokesman, John Kirby, was fending off questions from reporters about what Mr. Comey described as the departmentâ€™s lax security in handling classified information. White House officials said Mr. Obama also did not know about Mr. Comeyâ€™s plans ahead of time. The F. B. I. director said he did not coordinate the statement with the Justice Department or any other agency. â€œThey do not know what I am about to say,â€ he declared. A Republican former federal prosecutor, Mr. Comey seemed at first to be laying the groundwork for some kind of legal charge. Speaking sternly, and in far more detail than he usually does, he listed several previously undisclosed findings from the F. B. I. â€™s investigation: â–  Of 30, 000 emails Mrs. Clinton handed over to the State Department, 110 contained information that was classified at the time she sent or received them. Of those, Mr. Comey said, â€œa very small numberâ€ bore markings that identified them as classified. This finding is at odds with Mrs. Clintonâ€™s repeated assertions that none of the emails were classified at the time she sent or received them. The F. B. I. did not disclose the topics of the classified emails, but a number of the 110 are believed to have involved drone strikes. â–  The F. B. I. discovered â€œseveral thousandâ€   emails that were not in the original trove of 30, 000 turned over by Mrs. Clinton to the State Department. Three of those contained information that agencies have concluded was classified, though Mr. Comey said he did not believe Mrs. Clinton deliberately deleted or withheld them from investigators. â–  In saying that it was â€œpossibleâ€ that hostile foreign governments had gained access to Mrs. Clintonâ€™s personal account, Mr. Comey noted that she used her mobile device extensively while traveling outside the United States, including trips â€œin the territory of sophisticated adversaries. â€ â–  Mrs. Clinton used multiple private servers for her personal and government business, not just a single server at her home in New York that has been the focus of media reporting for more than a year. Her use of these servers  â€”   some of which were taken out of service and stored  â€”   made the F. B. I. â€™s job enormously complicated as it struggled to put together, in Mr. Comeyâ€™s words, a jigsaw puzzle with â€œmillions of email fragmentsâ€ in it. Despite all that, Mr. Comey said the F. B. I. did not find that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s conduct revealed â€œintentional misconduct or indications of disloyalty to the United States or efforts to obstruct justice. â€ But a person in her position, he said, â€œshould have known that an unclassified system was no placeâ€ for the emails she was sending. And he said it raised troubling questions about how the State Department handled classified information. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, declined to comment, except to say it was clear from Mr. Comeyâ€™s remarks that â€œtheyâ€™ve looked at this in excruciating detail. â€ Mr. Obama, he said, remained â€œenthusiasticâ€ about Mrs. Clintonâ€™s candidacy. The Clinton campaign clearly hoped that the announcement would bring to a close a saga that has haunted Mrs. Clinton since March 2015, when the existence of her personal email account surfaced. â€œWe are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the department is appropriate,â€ said the campaignâ€™s spokesman, Brian Fallon. â€œAs the secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved. â€ Republicans seized on Mr. Comeyâ€™s sharp criticism, saying it raised doubts about Mrs. Clintonâ€™s fitness for high office. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, asserted in a post on Twitter that David H. Petraeus, the former C. I. A. director, had been charged for doing far less than Mrs. Clinton, and the lack of charges showed that the system was â€œrigged. â€ In fact, F. B. I. officials have long said that what Mr. Petraeus did  â€”   knowingly handing a diary with classified information to his biographer and lover, then lying about it to investigators  â€”   was worse than what Mrs. Clinton did. In the Petraeus case, the F. B. I. recommended a felony indictment, but the Justice Department allowed him to plead to a misdemeanor. The deal that Mr. Petraeus received shadowed Mrs. Clintonâ€™s case from the start because it appeared to set a higher bar for bringing charges against her. â€œIn looking back at our investigations into the mishandling or removal of classified information,â€ Mr. Comey said, â€œwe cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. â€ Congressional Republicans swiftly called for the F. B. I. to release more details about its findings. â€œIf it wants to avoid giving the impression that the F. B. I. was pulling punches,â€ said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, â€œthe agency must now be more transparent than ever in releasing information. â€ Speaker Paul D. Ryan was equally critical. â€œWhile I respect the professionals at the F. B. I. this announcement defies explanation,â€ he said in a Twitter post. â€œNo one should be above the law. â€ For an agency that seemed to be in no rush, the F. B. I. â€™s investigation wrapped up quickly. By the time the investigators interviewed Mrs. Clinton in three and a half hours of questioning on Saturday, they had compiled months of findings. Mrs. Clinton appeared to say nothing to contradict what they had already discovered about how the private server was used, a law enforcement official said. The investigators then worked with Mr. Comey through the holiday weekend to review her testimony and determine whether there was any new information that might warrant criminal charges, law enforcement officials said. They found none. For weeks, F. B. I. agents expected the investigation would not yield charges. They shared Mr. Comeyâ€™s conclusion that Mrs. Clinton had showed poor judgment but that she had not committed a crime. In the spring, Mr. Comey declared that the campaign calendar would not dictate the pace of the investigation. But the Democratic National Convention begins on July 25 in Philadelphia, and F. B. I. officials did not want to be seen as influencing the outcome of the election after the nomination. Mr. Comeyâ€™s announcement was believed to be the first time that the F. B. I. had ever publicly disclosed its recommendations to the Justice Department about whether to charge someone in any   case, let alone a presidential candidate. His decision to announce the results of the investigation was made before the uproar over Ms. Lynchâ€™s meeting with Mr. Clinton, according to a law enforcement official. He decided to make his findings public, the official said, because he wanted to make the F. B. I. â€™s position clear before referring the case to the Justice Department. While the F. B. I. â€™s recommendation spares Mrs. Clinton and her aides criminal charges, it does not remove the possibility that they could be denied security clearances if Mrs. Clinton is elected and she appoints them to jobs that require such clearance. The State Department plans to conduct its own administrative review after the Justice Department acts. â€œWe donâ€™t share the broad assessment made of our institution that thereâ€™s a lax culture here when it comes to protecting classified information,â€ said Mr. Kirby, the State Department spokesman. â€œWe take it very, very seriously. â€", "output": "1.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: The criticism itself will neither surprise nor sting Pep Guardiola. He made that perfectly clear months ago, on the day he was presented as Manchester City manager. â€œI know when it is not going well, you are not going to help us,â€ he told the assembled news media that day. Guardiola has spent his entire coaching career at clubs where crisis and defeat are synonyms. The pressure cookers of Barcelona and Bayern Munich soon remove any thin skin. â€œWhen we play badly, you have to say, â€˜Oh, this team played badly,â€™â€ he said. Over the last 15 games, Guardiola has heard that more than he would have liked. Manchester City has won just four times since the start of October. Against Leicester City on Saturday, Guardiolaâ€™s side allowed three goals inside 20 minutes. His team is now 7 points behind Chelsea, the Premier Leagueâ€™s    leader. In recent weeks, Manchester City has played poorly more often than not. Guardiola has not especially enjoyed hearing it, of course. His news conferences have become awkwardly staccato, most of his answers preceded by a brief, pointed glare at his inquisitor. He would have expected nothing less, however. â€œI know this is business,â€ he said back in July. At times, however, it has not felt like business. In defeat, or even the absence of victory, Guardiola  â€”   more than any of his peers  â€”   is reproached not just for his professional decisions, his tactics and team selection, but for his personal flaws, too, as if the number of games City loses is directly proportional to the number of character failings its manager possesses. After the defeat at Leicester, for example, Peter Schmeichel, the former Manchester United goalkeeper, declared that Guardiolaâ€™s refusal to adapt his tactics to try to combat the reigning Premier League champions marked him as a â€œvery arrogant man. â€ â€œThat is a man saying: â€˜I know best. My way of playing football is the best,â€™â€ Schmeichel added. That is not the only accusation that has been leveled at Guardiola during Cityâ€™s stutter over the last 10 weeks: Intransigence has been featured, as has a supposed tendency to overcomplicate matters, and a perfectionistâ€™s restlessness. For his part, Guardiola admitted after leaving Bayern that he is â€œarrogant,â€ though not to the point that he thought he could change German soccer. All of this illustrates just how acidic, how charged, the subject of Guardiola has become. This is not just another of those quibbles and squabbles that sustain the soap opera of the Premier League over the course of a long season it runs deeper than that. There are few subjects  â€”   perhaps JosÃ© Mourinho apart  â€”   more contentious, more keenly felt than the issue of whether Guardiola deserves the lofty reputation that precedes him. That is because, at root, the debate is not actually about Guardiola at all. It is about English soccerâ€™s sense of self. Almost every week since Guardiola arrived, in those news media briefings he finds such a chore, one question has recurred. Now, he is almost waiting for it. He knows, at some point, he will be asked whether the Premier League is the strongest in the world. His answer is not always the same. In the middle of October, he chided the lazy assumption that soccer in Spain and Germany was lacking in intensity. â€œYou have not been there, so you do not know how intense it is,â€ he said. A couple of weeks later, he seemed to have changed his tune. â€œGuys, you have to be so proud,â€ he said, his tone studiously flat. â€œThe Premier League is so difficult. â€ His reaction to the question is now more consistent. He smiles, fleetingly, when he hears it: It is so familiar that it has almost become comforting. He is also, it is fair to say, just a little bit amused by the fixation it is, after all, curious that a league so bombastic in its   should appear to be so desperate for validation. There is, however, a reason for it. Guardiola, in English eyes, is the epitome of Continental sophistication. He has enjoyed unparalleled, almost unbroken, success in the two domestic competitions that might be considered the Premier Leagueâ€™s superiors, in Spain and Germany. He is also  â€”   from what he wears to how he thinks  â€”   resolutely other. He eschews both the traditional options for Premier League managers on the sideline  â€”   tracksuit to convey dynamism, business suit to project authority  â€”   in favor, usually, of a turtleneck, skinny jeans and sneakers. On the surface, so below: Many of Guardiolaâ€™s principles border on heretical in England. He does not mind that his goalkeeper, Claudio Bravo, is not a wonderful stopper of shots or a fearsome collector of crosses, because Guardiola believes it is more important that he plays a role in starting attacks. â€œIâ€™m sorry, but until my last day as a coach, I will try to play from my goalkeeper,â€ he said after a draw with Everton in the middle of this difficult run. Nor does he have much time for Englandâ€™s obsession with the physical. â€œI am not a coach for the tackles, so I do not train them,â€ he said after the defeat at Leicester. In a league and in a country that treasures its reputation for blood and thunder, where, as Xabi Alonso once observed, a tackle can be applauded almost as loudly as a goal, such an    dismissal is unthinkable. It is that otherness that makes Guardiolaâ€™s presence in England so fascinating, of course it is also, however, what makes him the subject of such heightened emotions. In part it is because his endorsement is a considerable prize in a public relations battle if Guardiola, of all people, can be won over by the idea that Englandâ€™s top division is the most demanding of all, then it would prove beyond doubt that there is substance behind the spin. But it is more than that. If Guardiola struggles  â€”   or if he fails outright  â€”   at Manchester City, then the myth of English exceptionalism is vindicated. The Premier League can continue to regard itself as a world apart. He will have failed the Rainy Night in Stoke test, the idea that greatness accrued elsewhere in Europe can only ever come with an asterisk until it has been proved when faced with the unique array of challenges on offer in England. If he succeeds, though, then all of that falls away. He has made it plain that he does not intend to compromise his beliefs for his new surroundings. â€œI won 21 titles in seven years: three titles per year playing in this way,â€ he said earlier this season. â€œIâ€™m sorry, guys. Iâ€™m not going to change. â€ This, in essence, is a battle of ideas. Guardiola, in many ways, represents a new way of thinking. Should he thrive, it would not just represent the triumph of his philosophy, but also the failure of so many of the tenets that are central to Englandâ€™s identity. That is where the vitriol comes from that is why it has become personal. It is not about Guardiola it is about us.", "output": "1. True"}

The bitterness that has long marked the fight intensified as Republicans seized the opportunity to make good on a central campaign promise to get rid of the law, a pledge reinforced on Wednesday by Vice   Mike Pence, who met with House Republicans not far from where the president gathered with Democrats. The Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obamaâ€™s signature health care law, has created online insurance marketplaces, offered new protections to people seeking health insurance, and provided coverage to millions of people near the poverty line through expanded Medicaid. Health policy experts say that system could collapse if Republicans cut off funds for the expanded coverage and end penalties for people who go without health insurance. â€œThe American people voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country,â€ Mr. Pence said, â€œand we are determined to give them that. â€ He said that   Donald J. Trump would use his executive authority to help make the transition away from the health care law, but did not offer specifics. Democrats vowed aggressive resistance, however, and said they would not participate in drawing up a replacement for the law after the swift efforts to unravel it. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new Democratic leader, playing off Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign slogan, said repealing the law would â€œmake America sick again. â€ Republicans are using a procedural approach that will allow them to repeal substantial parts of the health care law without Democratsâ€™ being able to mount a filibuster in the Senate. By a vote of 51 to 48 on Wednesday, the Senate took the first step, agreeing to take up a budget resolution, or blueprint, that would clear the way for legislation repealing major provisions of the  law. But even as Republicans spoke of moving quickly to repeal the law, it remained far less clear how and when they would go about replacing it. Senate debate on the budget resolution is expected to continue for several days, and the House plans to take up the measure once the Senate has approved it. As Republicans charged ahead, both sides seemed cognizant of the possible fallout from unwinding the law, which has become deeply enmeshed with Americaâ€™s health care system and has provided insurance for about 20 million people. Mr. Trump weighed in with several Twitter posts. He advised that Republicans needed to â€œbe careful in that the Dems own the failed Obamacare disaster,â€ and added, â€œDonâ€™t let the Schumer clowns out of this web. â€ Mr. Trump predicted that the health care law would â€œfall of its own weight. â€ Representative Chris Collins of New York, a Republican who is one of Mr. Trumpâ€™s top supporters in Congress and is part of his transition team, said it was important to be sure that Democrats bear responsibility for the failings of the health care law. Republicans point out that premiums have risen and that consumers in many places have fewer choices of insurers. â€œWe have to make sure we keep reminding America, we are repealing it because it failed, we are repealing it because they all but demanded that we repeal it,â€ Mr. Collins said. â€œAnd that was a key piece of Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign. â€ But as Republicans expressed eagerness to repeal the law, they acknowledged that replacing it would take more time. It is also unclear how insurance companies will react during this period and whether they will continue to offer the marketplace plans that millions of people have come to rely on. â€œThere will naturally be a reasonable transition period,â€ said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. â€œYou canâ€™t adopt new reforms all at once. â€ Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, noted that it had taken six years to get into â€œthe ditch we find ourselves in now. â€ â€œWhen your truck or car is in a ditch, the first thing you need to do is get out of the ditch,â€ Mr. Cornyn said. â€œAnd sometimes that takes a lot of hard work. â€ To that, Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, parried that when a car goes into a ditch, â€œthe first thing I donâ€™t do is dismantle the car. â€ â€œThat doesnâ€™t help me get anywhere in terms of transportation,â€ she said. Democrats signaled little interest in helping Republicans determine what to do after repealing major parts of the health care law. Mr. Schumer predicted that in a year, Republicans would â€œregret that they came out so fast out of the box. â€ He said Democrats would consider working on a replacement only after Republicans presented their own plan. â€œIf you are repealing, show us what youâ€™ll replace it with first,â€ Mr. Schumer said. â€œThen weâ€™ll look at what you have and see what we can do. â€ Later, Mr. Schumer said of Mr. Trump, â€œItâ€™s his and their responsibility, plain and simple  â€”   name calling isnâ€™t going to get anything done. â€ He added, â€œThey really need to calm things down a little. â€ Speaker Paul D. Ryan tried to offer assurance that no change in coverage would be abrupt. â€œThe point is, in 2017, we donâ€™t want people to be caught with nothing,â€ he said. â€œWe want to make sure that thereâ€™s an orderly transition so that the rug is not pulled out from under the families who are currently struggling under Obamacare while we bring relief. â€ Mr. Obama huddled with congressional Democrats for about 90 minutes in what was billed by the White House as a strategy session to forge a unified Democratic response to the Republicansâ€™ rollback effort. In reality, the session was essentially a   party for a man who passed his signature legislative accomplishment under   majorities in Congress and a â€œpep rallyâ€ for Affordable Care Act defenders, in the words of an attendee, Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia. The gathering, which could be Mr. Obamaâ€™s last trip to the halls of Congress that have been the site of alternating triumph and defeat, had a     air, with numerous Democratic lawmakers, including Mr. Johnson, sneaking out to attend to business more pressing than hearing the presidentâ€™s words. Mr. Obama, for his part, did not ask his allies to block all efforts to alter the law, but warned Democrats against â€œrescuingâ€ Republicans by defecting on votes that would dismantle it. The president provided an array of arguments for keeping the Affordable Care Act and offered a mild mea culpa for his shortcomings as a salesman over the years. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said, â€œHe acknowledged the failures in selling the law in its entirety to the American people. â€", "output": "1. True"}

Among other things, the Indian government accused the Pakistani authorities of refusing to return the shoes of the visiting wife of Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav after she turned them over to security for the visit. Jadhav, a former officer in the Indian navy, was arrested in March 2016 in the Pakistani province of Baluchistan, where there has been a long-running conflict between security forces and separatists, and he was convicted of planning espionage and sabotage. His wife and mother were allowed to see him behind a glass window on Monday, eight months after he was sentenced to death, but that gesture of goodwill appeared to have quickly descended into acrimony. Ties between the nuclear-armed neighbors are in a deep chill and Jadhav s case has added to long-running tensions, with each accusing the other of supporting cross-border violence.  Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said Jadhav s family had been subjected to harassment when they arrived to see him.  The Pakistani press was allowed on multiple occasions to approach family members closely, harass and hector them and hurl false and loaded accusations about (Shri) Jadhav,  Kumar said in a statement. Pakistan s foreign ministry rejected the accusations.  The Indian baseless allegations and twists ... about the visit of the wife and mother of Commander Jadhav, a convicted terrorist and spy, who has confessed to his crimes, are categorically rejected,  it said. The Pakistani statement added that it had kept both Pakistani, Indian and international media  at a safe distance, as requested by India . Pakistan authorities say Jadhav confessed to being assigned by India s intelligence service to plan, coordinate and organise espionage and sabotage activities in Baluchistan  aiming to destabilise and wage war against Pakistan . India says Jadhav is innocent, and it won an injunction from the World Court to delay his execution, arguing he was denied diplomatic assistance during his trial by a military court. On Monday, Pakistan released a picture of Jadhav s mother, Avanti, and wife, Chetankul, seated at a desk and speaking to him from behind the glass partition. Islamabad said it had honored its commitment to give access to the family.  But India said Jadhav s mother was not allowed to speak in her native Marathi language and was frequently interrupted during the meeting.  Kumar said the two women had been asked to remove the red dot that Hindus wear as well as their jewelry and shoes during security screenings, adding that Pakistani authorities had refused to return the shoes that Jadhav s wife had worn. The Pakistani foreign ministry rebuttal did not address the report of the missing shoes.

After losses, he was so angry that he couldnâ€™t speak. The team was part of his identity. It started in his childhood, when the quarterback Brian Sipe led the Browns to improbable   victories. As an adult, Mr. Stemler became a   holder. He cried when the team moved to Baltimore in 1995, and he found love again when the National Football League awarded Cleveland with a new Browns franchise in 1998. But somehow, after hundreds of Sundays at the stadium or in the television glow, it all came to an end. It wasnâ€™t because the Browns were bad, necessarily. It was something else. Something deeper. Mr. Stemler, a    landscape supplies salesman in Columbus, Ohio, pinpoints the moment to a Sunday in October 2014, when the Browns thumped the Pittsburgh Steelers,  . As giddy fans spoke of a new era in Cleveland, Mr. Stemler felt nothing. â€œIs this really what makes me happy?â€ he asked himself. â€œEveryone is going nuts, and Iâ€™m just kind of sitting there,â€ Mr. Stemler added. â€œI remember this guy looking at me and asking: â€˜Whatâ€™s wrong? Why arenâ€™t you excited? â€™â€ The strange feeling did not go away. â€œI think I have gotten to a point in my life where I need to let things go that donâ€™t bring me enjoyment,â€ he said. â€œI think as you get older, you realize you donâ€™t hang on to things that donâ€™t bring you joy. If itâ€™s not making me happy, then why do it? Donâ€™t just do it because you feel like you should be doing it. Thatâ€™s what I was doing  â€”   I was going up every Sunday for the Browns, and I was dreading it. â€ Most fans develop a bond with a team as children. For reasons that may go unquestioned, they stick with it, no matter the emotional toll. In the view of the New Yorker writer and editor Roger Angell, our connection to sports is ultimately tied to caring: â€œdeeply and passionately, really caring  â€”   which is a capacity or an emotion that has almost gone out of our lives,â€ he wrote in 1975. But then there are those fans who begin to question why they care so much. Once doubt takes hold, they wonder why they spend so much time and emotion on mere games. Before they know it, they are on a path that takes them away from the majority culture for whom sports adulation is the norm. Julio Guerrero, 33, was an impressionable boy when the quarterback Brett Favre came on the scene for the Green Bay Packers in 1992. As Favre gave new life to the Packers, Mr. Guerrero, who lives in Milwaukee and manages a call center, became devoted to the team and joined the Sunday ritual that defines football fandom. â€œYou donâ€™t miss a game unless you have like a really special family function, like a wedding or a funeral,â€ he said. â€œThat is part of your Sunday. Itâ€™s part of the culture. Itâ€™s what you do. You go to work five days a week and you make sure you watch the Packers. â€ Mr. Guerrero embraced Favreâ€™s style of play. Here was an unruly kid from Mississippi who won over Green Bay fans with his gunslinger style and led the team to a Super Bowl victory. It seemed as if the fun would go on forever. But when Favre left the Packers in 2008, Mr. Guerrero sensed his devotion starting to wane. Somehow he couldnâ€™t relate to Favreâ€™s successor, Aaron Rodgers, and he realized his fandom had reached an end when he wasnâ€™t thrilled by the Packersâ€™ Super Bowl victory in 2011. He no longer spends his Sundays in front of the TV. He has become the guy at work who canâ€™t talk about the game on Monday morning. He has built a new life for himself that doesnâ€™t include football. â€œI think the new set of friends I have are more into music and movies and arts, which is more of what I am into these days,â€ Mr. Guerrero said. â€œI donâ€™t really feel that connected anymore to people who go to the bar and watch the football game every Sunday. â€ Even before he attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Robert McNees lived for its basketball team, the Tar Heels. Now an associate professor of physics at Loyola University Chicago, he can still see a freshman named Michael Jordan hitting the game winner against Georgetown in the 1982 N. C. A. A. tournament championship game. Dr. McNeesâ€™s affection for the team lasted well after he graduated. But as he grew older, he began to realize that much of his emotional attachment was bound to his fond memories of his college days. His moment of reckoning came in 2012. After holding a   lead with two and a half minutes to go against Duke, North Carolina ended up losing at the buzzer. Dr. McNees was inconsolable. Then he started to question himself. â€œI was bummed out after that,â€ he said. â€œThen I was bummed out about the fact that I was so bummed out about it. Why? These are two groups of   to    playing a game. It should not have that much of an impact on a grown man. â€ Dr. McNees, 43, decided to take a step back. He has not sworn off the Tar Heels altogether, but he no longer watches every game. And when he does, he is careful not to allow the outcome to ruin his day. Finding that kind of middle ground is not an option for most fans, including Rob Jordan, a    lawyer in Manhattan. As a child, he had posters of the baseball stars Ken Griffey Jr. and Mike Piazza on the walls of his bedroom. As Mike Schmidt cried while announcing his retirement at a 1989 news conference, Mr. Jordan wept right along with him. His fandom deepened with the rise of fantasy sports. He became well versed in even the most obscure baseball, basketball and football players, and he said he won thousands of dollars as a result of his expertise. About the time he turned 30, he decided that fantasy sports was no longer the best use of his time. And it wasnâ€™t a big step from cutting out fantasy to leaving behind sports fandom altogether. Recently, Mr. Jordan gave up cable TV, meaning he no longer has access to ESPN. He didnâ€™t bother to watch an inning of the 2016 World Series  â€”   not even Game 7, which was viewed by 40 million  â€”   although it was broadcast on network television. â€œI think there was a point where I consciously looked around and said, â€˜Hey, I can keep admiring and celebrating the accomplishments of somebody else for a minimal amount of   entertainment value, or I can better allocate that time toward my own dreams and projects,â€™â€ Mr. Jordan said. â€œClearly, I came out on the side of the latter. â€ â€œIt got to a point where even seeing a grown man in his   wearing a jersey with some other name on the back struck me as immature and odd,â€ he added. â€œYou say, â€˜Come on man, grow up. â€™â€", "output": "1.

Obama won the White House in 2008 partially on a promise to overcome partisan divides in Washington. He has called his failure to do that, seven years after taking office, a regret. On the ninth anniversary of his 2007 announcement in Springfield that he was running for president, Obama addressed Illinois lawmakers at the state Capitol where he once worked as a state senator in what he described as a collegial, friendly atmosphere. â€œI was able to be part of that here, and yet I couldnâ€™t translate it the way I wanted to in our politics in Washington,â€ he said. Obama said reducing the influence of money, making it easier to vote and ending the way voting districts were drawn politically would help solve the problem.  â€œWeâ€™ve got to build a better politics,â€ he said. â€œWhen I hear voices in either party boast of their refusal to compromise as an accomplishment in and of itself, Iâ€™m not impressed.â€ Congressional Republicans have said the Democratic president is often unwilling to work with them to pass legislation. â€œâ€The central premise of the Obama presidency was to unite the country, and thatâ€™s been an unquestionable failure,â€ Doug Andres, a spokesman for Republican Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan, said in a statement.  Obama has made clear he views Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trumpâ€™s rhetoric as corrosive. Trump, who has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, won the New Hampshire Republican primary on Tuesday as the parties hold state-by-state nominating contests for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Obama. The chamber in which Obama addressed Illinois lawmakers also became a microcosm of the challenges he was hoping to address. Democrats stood and clapped when Obama said the country was better off since he became president. Republicans stayed seated. The situation was similar to what occurred at his annual State of the Union addresses in Washington.  Obama chided both sides, however, and said he believed Republicans shared some of his values even if they disagreed on how to enact them. He noted the importance of basic governance such as fixing roads and passing budgets, a reference to a crisis facing his home state.  Republican Governor Bruce Rauner has refused to sign a spending plan for Illinoisâ€™ 2016 fiscal year without winning Democratic concessions that would weaken collective bargaining rights for public-sector unions, impose term limits, freeze property taxes and make it harder for workers injured on the job to collect damages from their employers. Democrats, who control both of Illinoisâ€™ legislative chambers, have resisted his demands, setting up a stalemate that has left the stateâ€™s public universities and social-service programs starved for funding. Chicago State University, for example, last week declared a financial emergency, and furloughs have been imposed at other public universities. Obamaâ€™s trip was aimed both at solidifying his legacy in a familiar place and making good on a promise to spend his last year working toward healing partisan wounds. Shortly after arriving, he stopped at a restaurant he frequented as a state senator, then shook hands with onlookers outside the Old State Capitol, where Obama announced his bid for the White House exactly nine years ago.", "output": "1.

In June al Shabaab overran a military base in the town of Af Urur in the hills area, killing 38 people, mainly soldiers.

[Last year the Kellogg Company discontinued several flavors of its Kashi brand cereal, a product advertised as a healthier cereal choice. But instead of simply picking some of Kelloggâ€™s other brands to replace Kashi, school officials decided to hold taste testing for other, newer brands. Ultimately the district chose the Back to the Roots brand, The New York Times reported.  The new brand features lower levels of sugar and salt, as well as fewer calories than any of the Kelloggâ€™s cereals, the paper reports. The small companyâ€™s offering is also free of preservatives and does not artificially add vitamins. In addition, its cereals are certified as organic. â€œBreakfast is really important to us, and weâ€™re trying to get our menu to where we want it to be,â€ said Eric Goldstein, the chief executive of the Office of School Support Services, told the paper. â€œIn the world we live in, though, there are so many constraints, so being able to offer Back to the Roots cereals for us is like a breath of fresh air. â€ Up to 254, 000 children a day eats breakfast at New York City schools, according to district officials. The move to replace several of the Kelloggâ€™s brands with the healthier choice comes on the heels of pressure from Congress, the state and some parents for schools to make better choices for school food programs. New York school officials also said that during the taste testing, kids chose the Back to the Roots brand over others. The district is still offering brands by the big cereal companies  â€”   General Mills, Post Foods, and even Kelloggâ€™s, among them  â€”   but school administrators feel the new brands are offering a healthier choice. The big change in New York only adds to the woes of the Kellogg company, whose stock has been falling along with its market share. Only a month ago the company announced it was slashing its sales force, laying off over 1, 000 workers, and shuttering 39 distribution centers. The February announcement came on top of major cuts already announced this year. Early in January Kellogg Co. announced it was firing 250 workers. The multiple rounds of cutbacks occurred after Kelloggâ€™s decided to cut its advertising with Breitbart News at the end of 2016, thereby snubbing Breitbartâ€™s 45 million readers. In November, Kelloggâ€™s noted that Breitbart Newsâ€™s conservative readers are not â€œaligned with our values as a company. â€ While the decision by Kelloggâ€™s to cease advertising made virtually no revenue impact on Breitbart. com, it did represent an escalation in the war by leftist companies like Target and Allstate against conservative customers whose values propelled Donald Trump into the White House.

The new poll finds former neurosurgeon Ben Carson rising 10 points to land in second place with 19%. Together, these two non-politicians now hold the support of a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, and separately, both are significantly ahead of all other competitors.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush stands in third place with 9%, down 4 points since August, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz holds fourth place with 7%. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker follow at 5%, with all other candidates at 3% or less, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who notched the only other statistically significant shift in the poll by falling 5 points since August.\n\nTrump's gains come most notably among two groups that had proven challenging for him in the early stages of his campaign -- women and those with college degrees. While he gained just 4 points among men in the last month (from 27% in August to 31% now), he's up 13 points among women, rising from 20% in August to 33% now. Trump has also boosted his share of the vote among college graduates, increasing his support among those with degrees from 16% in August to 28% now. Among those without degrees, he stands at 33%, just slightly higher than the 28% support he had in August.\n\nTrump has also catapulted ahead of the rest of the field among Republicans who back the tea party movement, from 27% support in August to 41% now. Among that group in the new poll, Carson follows with 21%, and Cruz, another candidate with an anti-Washington message, holds third with 11%. No other candidate tops 5% among tea partiers. Carson's gains, meanwhile, have come chiefly among core partisans -- he's up 13 points among Republicans and 11 points among conservatives -- and he runs closest to Trump among white evangelicals (32% back Trump, 28% Carson), a key voting bloc within the Republican primary electorate. Carson also has enthusiasm at his side. Republicans are more than twice as likely to say they would be enthusiastic with Carson at the top of the ticket than if Rubio, Cruz, Walker or Bush led the GOP into 2016, and while he and Trump are about even in enthusiasm (43% would be enthusiastic if Carson got the nod, 40% if Trump did), fewer say they would be disappointed if Carson emerged the victor (20% would be dissatisfied or upset if Carson won, 32% if Trump did). Still, most Republican voters (51%) think Trump is most likely to emerge as the GOP winner, well ahead of the 19% who think Bush will top the party ticket and 11% who think Carson will. In a July poll, 14% of Republican voters said they thought Walker was most likely to wind up the winner, in the new poll, that figure stands at just 1%. Support for the \"outsider\" contingent of Trump, Carson and to some extent businesswoman Carly Fiorina (who hasn't built on her post-debate boomlet in this poll, she has just 3% support) rests more on their positions on the issues than their experience outside of Washington. Among those backing one of those three candidates without experience in elective office, 75% say they back them because of their views on the issues, 16% because of their on-the-job experience and 7% because they dislike the other candidates. Among those backing candidates who have previously been elected to office, 34% say their experience is the main draw, 51% issue positions, and 14% say it's due to dislike of the other candidates. \n\n\n\n\"So, ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again,\" Trump told the crowd at his announcement.

Although Bush's support for the nomination has dipped only slightly since the August poll, there are few positive signs for a man once seen as the front-runner for the nomination. The 19% who think he's most likely to win the party's nomination is down from 31% in July. Nearly half of Republicans (47%) say they would be dissatisfied or upset should he win the nomination, and just 16% say they would be enthusiastic about his candidacy if he did win. And his push to be the candidate of economic growth hasn't resonated: Just 7% who call the economy an extremely important issue say they would back him for the Republican nomination. As Trump and Carson have gained, Republican voters have begun to gain enthusiasm for the coming presidential election. While 28% described themselves as \"extremely enthusiastic\" about the election in July and August, that's now climbed to 34%, while deep enthusiasm among Democrats has dipped from 33% to 28%. Trump's growth in the field has also come alongside an increase in attention to the issue of illegal immigration. A majority of Republicans now call the issue extremely important to their vote for president, 51% now call it extremely important, up from 39% in a June CNN/ORC poll. Among that group, Trump holds a wide lead, with 42% support compared with 17% for Carson, 10% for Cruz, 9% for Bush and 5% for Walker.

For that reason alone, the budget is another sign of a president feeling unhindered in his final years of office and eager to take advantage of an improving economy.\n\nDetails of the budget have been guarded closely by administration and Capitol Hill officials. But sources on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue said Obama will propose increasing discretionary spending by about $70 billion (several sources cautioned the proposed increase likely will be slightly less). The money would be divided equally between defense and non-defense accounts.\n\nâ€œThe President will propose to end the across-the-board sequester cuts that threaten our economy and our military,\" a White House official said. \"The Presidentâ€™s budget will fully reverse those cuts for domestic priorities, and match those investments dollar-for-dollar with the resources our troops need to keep America safe.â€\n\nAn administration official told The Huffington Post that the spending additions the president will outline -- which appear larger than those he proposed in last year's budget -- would be offset by cutting spending and closing tax loopholes. The overall budget, the official added, would have measures to reduce the deficit through a similar combination of savings.\n\nFor Republicans, the proposal will likely be perceived as fiscally reckless, if not politically brazen. After all, it was the GOP wins in the 2010 election that set the stage for sequestration's across-the-board budget cuts in the first place.\n\nAfter that election cycle, Obama attempted to craft several debt-reduction deals with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) as a nod to conservative victories. But the deals never came to fruition. And in the summer of 2011, as the debt ceiling was nearly breached, the two sides fell back on an exchange that neither truly liked.\n\nUnder The Budget Control Act of 2011, spending was reduced by nearly $1 trillion and Congress created the so-called Super Committee to find roughly $1.5 trillion more in savings. When the committee failed to find consensus, mandatory sequestration cuts kicked in, forcing more than $1 trillion in cuts over 10 years. Sequestration was delayed a few months starting at the beginning of 2013. But by March of that year, it was law of the land.\n\nThough Republicans have lamented sequestration's effects on defense operations -- and some have worried about non-defense programs in their districts -- they have largely resisted proposals to replace sequestration with any package that includes tax hikes.\n\nâ€œRepublicans believe there are smarter ways to cut spending than the sequester and have passed legislation to replace it multiple times, only to see the president continue to demand tax hikes,\" said Cory Fritz, a spokesman for Boehner. \"Until he gets serious about solving our long-term spending problem itâ€™s hard to take him seriously.\"\n\nBut Obama also may find critics of his budget proposal on his side of the aisle -- for not being bolder. A roughly $70 billion increase may seem healthy, if not daring. But as The New York Times noted, it represents a small portion of a budget expected to reach $3.9 trillion, and it comes at a time when the deficit is shrinking. Senate Budget Committee ranking member Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), for one, has called for a major government investment in infrastructure and other domestic priorities well beyond where the Obama administration appears willing to go.\n\nThe administrationâ€™s hope is that somewhere in the ideological middle (albeit closer to the liberal side of the divide), there will be enough lawmakers to forge a majority.\n\nRep.

Democrats had unexpectedly sat down in the middle of the House of Representatives chamber to demand a vote on gun control legislation, and with the body officially in recess,   the cable network known for â€œgavel to gavelâ€ coverage of Congress, had no means to cover it. Then it found an unlikely source: the social media feeds of House members who had turned to Periscope, a live   app, and Facebook Live. â€œAs soon as we knew it was available, we went for it,â€ Terry Murphy,  â€™s vice president for programming, said on Thursday after a short nightâ€™s sleep. â€œWe didnâ€™t know when we got into it that we would be doing it for 24 hours. There just wasnâ€™t much time to debate it. â€ So began what was arguably the most memorable   period the network has seen in years, one that Mr. Murphy estimated had probably set a record for continuous broadcast of a social media feed and that others suggested amounted to something of a declaration of independence from congressional landlords, who control the TV cameras inside the Senate and House chambers. But it was perhaps even more momentous for Periscope, which debuted just over a year ago after being acquired by Twitter. As of 5 p. m. Wednesday, Twitter messages that one or both of the live video streams broadcast by Representatives Scott Peters and Eric Swalwell of California embedded had already been viewed more than a million times, according to the company. â€œWe always told ourselves that if we were successful, we were building a tool to give a voice to the voiceless,â€ Kayvon Beykpour,   and chief executive of Periscope, said in an interview. â€œItâ€™s showing you the truth from different peopleâ€™s perspectives. Itâ€™s a really raw way of experiencing what you watch. â€œIn this case, itâ€™s really ironic that the voiceless were our elected representatives. â€ Twitter has long had a presence in Washington, and holds regular training sessions for politicians and media organizations on how best to use its tools. After Twitter bought Periscope, the video app was incorporated into the companyâ€™s training efforts. About a month ago, Twitter held a training session with the House Democratic caucus that focused specifically on how to use Periscope. A staff member from Mr. Petersâ€™s office attended. On Wednesday, when   lost access to cameras  â€”   which are normally shut off when the House is not in session  â€”   an aide suggested that Mr. Peters turn to Periscope as a means of broadcasting what was happening on the House floor. A Facebook spokeswoman said that broadcasts by members of the House had reached more than 2. 9 million viewers on the social media site. Mark Zuckerberg, the companyâ€™s founder, wrote in a post on Thursday morning that use of Facebook Live was â€œbringing more openness to the political process. â€ Overnight ratings were not available for  . Other networks shared brief segments from the live feeds, but it was   that stuck with them, overriding other coverage and cutting away only when Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other House Republicans returned to the floor around 10 p. m. for a series of votes.   is no stranger to   sessions  â€”   be they for a filibuster or a contentious vote  â€”   but the impromptu   which Mr. Murphy said the network had no advance knowledge of, was different. A staff of around 25 people remained overnight in the Capitol and at the networkâ€™s offices a few blocks away, and the regular morning team was called in four hours early. â€œIt was the least scripted of the   sessions weâ€™ve had to cover,â€ Mr. Murphy said. The fact that   does not control the cameras inside congressional chambers has been a source of disquiet for the network since it arrived on the air in 1979. Every time a new leader comes to power in either chamber, Mr. Murphy said, network executives send a letter requesting greater access, including the placement of independent media cameras inside the chamber. Thus far, they have been denied. The network employs about 270 people and has an annual budget of $70 million, according to a spokesman, Howard Mortman. It enjoys a niche following: Journalists covering the federal government treat it as a lifeline, and for those addicted to politics from coast to coast, few sources can rival its unvarnished transmission. While  â€™s decision to stick with the protest drew a flurry of criticism on Twitter, Mr. Mortman said there had been no serious concerns raised from Mr. Ryanâ€™s office or outside groups. â€œWe want to show as much of Congress as we can  â€”   thatâ€™s our mission,â€ he said. â€œThis clearly is a big story, and this gives us a way to show whatâ€™s happening in an area where our own cameras are not allowed. â€", "output": "1.

Trump on Thursday announced a new campaign finance chairman in response to questions about his readiness for a general election race. Trump, speaking to thousands at a rally in Charleston, West Virginia, on Thursday night, sharpened his criticism of Clinton, the kind of tactic that some Republican strategists believe will help unify the party. He blasted Clinton for saying recently she would impose clean-energy policies that would put coal miners out of business. He put on a hard hat presented to him by the stateâ€™s coal minersâ€™ association and made a shoveling motion. â€œAnd for those miners, get ready: Youâ€™re going to be working your asses off,â€ he said. In a sign some Republicans are rallying around Trump, Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, whose family has helped bankroll the anti-Trump group Our Principles, is set to endorse Trump on Friday when the candidate visits Omaha. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who ran unsuccessfully for the 2016 nomination, told CNN he now supported Trump as well. Ryan criticized Trump in December for proposing to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States and knocked him in March for failing to denounce white supremacist groups during a television interview. The House speaker, who was the running mate of Republican 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a harsh Trump critic, said he hoped the party would be unified by this summer but that the pressure was on Trump to do that. â€œHe won fair and square,â€ Ryan said of Trump, acknowledging his own policy differences with the New York billionaire businessman. He added: â€œIf we donâ€™t unify all wings of the party, weâ€™re not going to win this election.â€ Ryan repeatedly denied interest in running for president this year despite attempts to draft him by some in his party. He has been putting together a policy plan for House Republicans to campaign on, which he says will be released before the convention in July. Trump on Thursday began shifting focus from the bruising primary campaign to the general election. He has largely used his own money for his primary fight but plans to follow the more typical path of raising money from outside sources for the general election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. He named his campaign finance chief on Thursday", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: WASHINGTON  â€”   Some of the current members of the Supreme Court had written books before they were nominated. Remember â€œCivil Procedure in Sweden,â€ by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Or â€œRegulation and Its Reform,â€ by Justice Stephen G. Breyer? Perhaps not. But a book by Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trumpâ€™s pick for the Supreme Court, may make a more lasting impression. It is called â€œThe Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,â€ and it opens a window into Judge Gorsuchâ€™s thinking not only on those topics, which are interesting enough, but also on the relationship between them and abortion. The book, published in 2006, is ambitious, learned, balanced and unusually lucid, at ease in philosophy, law and empirical research. It discusses the Supreme Courtâ€™s abortion jurisprudence in detail, but Judge Gorsuchâ€™s goal was not to critique those cases. He asked, rather, whether a constitutional right to abortion necessarily implies a right to assisted suicide and euthanasia. Sure, there are general statements about the value of human life, drawn from what Judge Gorsuch called â€œsecular moral theory. â€ â€œHuman life is fundamentally and inherently valuable,â€ he wrote, adding that â€œthe intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong. â€ This led him to support existing laws barring assisted suicide and euthanasia. But that broad statement does not answer the question of whether a fetus is a human life in the sense that Judge Gorsuch meant, or where he stands on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. Asked about the book at his 2006 confirmation hearing, after President George W. Bush nominated him to the federal appeals court in Denver, Judge Gorsuch first said that his personal views did not affect his judicial work. â€œMy writings, just to clarify, have been largely in defense of existing law, that is, they are consistent with the Supreme Courtâ€™s decisions in this area and existing law in most places,â€ he added. â€œSo, I do not think there is actually much tension between my writings and anything that might come before the court. â€ That is about right. In the book, Judge Gorsuch argued that bans on assisted suicide and euthanasia should be retained, based partly on his understanding of the limits of the constitutional logic of the Supreme Courtâ€™s abortion decisions. His account of Roe v. Wade, for instance, is straightforward. â€œUnder Roeâ€™s express holding,â€ Judge Gorsuch wrote, â€œa fetus does not qualify as a person. â€ In a footnote, he described a contrary view from a 1986 dissent. Notably, it came from a mentor, Justice Byron R. White, for whom Judge Gorsuch worked as a law clerk in 1993 and 1994. â€œThe right to terminate a pregnancy differs from the right to use contraceptives because the former involves the death of a person while the latter does not,â€ Judge Gorsuch wrote, describing his old bossâ€™s views. The important point for Judge Gorsuch was that the debate over assisted suicide was different from the one over abortion, as there was no doubt that there was a person involved when suicide was at issue. The task there, he said, was balancing â€œthe interests of those persons who wish to control the timing of their deaths and those vulnerable individuals whose lives may be taken without their consent due to mistake, abuse or pressure in a regime where assisted suicide is legal. â€ Judge Gorsuch also worked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy during his clerkship for Justice White, who had by then retired. As it happened, Judge Gorsuch arrived at the Supreme Court soon after another major abortion decision, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, issued in 1992. In a carefully hedged statement that avoided reliance on firsthand knowledge, though he doubtless had some, Judge Gorsuch described the atmosphere at the court in the wake of the Casey decision. â€œRumors persist,â€ Judge Gorsuch wrote, â€œof considerable acrimony among court members during deliberations in Casey, arising perhaps in part because Justice Kennedy reportedly switched his vote after the courtâ€™s conference on the case, thereby altering the outcome in the case. â€ The Casey decision is generally said to have reaffirmed Roeâ€™s core holding. In the book, Judge Gorsuch argued that the decision should be read narrowly, in an apparent attempt to limit its implications for a right to assisted suicide or euthanasia. He acknowledged that the controlling opinion in Casey  â€”   from Justices Kennedy, Sandra Day Oâ€™Connor and David H. Souter  â€”   contained sweeping language, and he quoted what he called its â€œmystery of lifeâ€ passage, which is generally attributed to Justice Kennedy. â€œAt the heart of liberty is the right to define oneâ€™s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life,â€ the joint opinion said. But the opinion also relied on a second and narrower ground, saying that respect for precedent  â€”   stare decisis, in legal Latin  â€”   required the court to follow Roe. Judge Gorsuch argued that the flowery stuff was an aside. â€œUsually, though not always, only the narrowest rationale is said to control future courts,â€ he wrote. â€œCasey may come to be dominantly read as a stare decisis decision  â€”   a ruling, in essence, that we must respect the abortion right out of traditional deference to settled law  â€”   rather than creating any new,   right to â€˜define oneâ€™s concept of existence,â€™â€ Judge Gorsuch wrote. At bottom, then, Judge Gorsuch saw no necessary constitutional connection between a right to abortion and one to assisted suicide or euthanasia. But Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year and whom Judge Gorsuch hopes to replace, said the questions were related, if only because the Constitution was silent about all of them. â€œWe have now determined,â€ Justice Scalia said in a 2004 speech, â€œthat liberties exist under the federal Constitution  â€”   the right to abortion, the right to homosexual sodomy  â€”   which were so little rooted in the traditions of the American people that they were criminal for 200 years. â€ He added that his colleagues might be prepared to discover a right to assisted suicide in the Constitution. â€œWeâ€™re not ready to announce that right,â€ he said, sarcastically. â€œCheck back with us. â€", "output": "1.

[CNBC reports that the social media company posted a   earnings report showing earnings of 16 cents per share on a revenue of $717 million. This fell short of analystsâ€™ expectations, who had anticipated a higher revenue of approximately $740. 1 million, according to an estimate from Thomson Reuters. Twitter had posted 12 cents per share on revenue of $479 million in 2016.  Twitter adjusted its guidance for the first quarter from the range of $75 million to $95 million, falling fall short of Wall Streetâ€™s expected estimate of $191. 3 million. Twitterâ€™s stock crashed a full 10 percent following the announcement of the earnings report. The company did report a 4% increase in active monthly users with 319 million users per month, up from 317 million users in 2016. Twitterâ€™s advertising revenue decreased from the year previously, with the company reporting revenue of $638 million. Of that, US revenue was down 5% totaling $440 million, while international revenue totaled $277 million, an increase of 12% from 2016. The company also reported a loss of $143. 6 million in the 4th quarter, much worse than the reported $67. 2 million loss in the same quarter for 2016, according to NASDAQ. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey discussed the poor performance of the company, saying, â€œWhile revenue growth continues to lag audience growth, we are applying the same focused approach that drove audience growth to our revenue product portfolio, focusing on our strengths and the   nature of our service. This will take time, but weâ€™re moving fast to show results. â€ Twitterâ€™s Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto claimed that   were happy with the companyâ€™s revenue growth: â€œRevenue growth will continue to lag audience growth due to the sales cycle, and could be further impacted by the escalating competition for digital advertising spending and our efforts to   our revenue product feature portfolio. â€ The company also stated that they had made great progress with Twitter features on the platform such as the â€œHome Timeline. â€ â€œWe also improved the relevance of notifications to increase engagement and bring people back to Twitter. These changes improved retention for both monthly active and daily active usage, as well as increased Tweet impressions and time spent on the service,â€ the company stated. It is believed by some that President Trumpâ€™s tweets may have a large effect on the platform in both positive and negative capacities. Analyst Richard Greenfield stated, â€œThe incessant news flow from the Trump administration playing out on Twitter and the ensuing global reaction pushes Twitter users to be increasingly engaged with the platform. â€ However, Richard Kramer of Arete Research told CNBC that the presidentâ€™s tweeting may deter brands from advertising on Twitter due to fear of the current extreme polarization among Americans over politics. â€œI think whatever your political views, itâ€™s clear that Trump is extremely divisive, and this isnâ€™t really a positive for advertisers,â€ said Kramer. Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft and a Twitter shareholder, spoke to CNBC about Twitterâ€™s performance and CEO Jack Dorsey. â€œEvery time I talk to Jack, the message is, â€˜We need more. More innovation. Move, move, move,â€™â€ said Ballmer, â€œGet the cost base right and move forward. â€ â€œRunning two companies is not the best idea,â€ said Ballmer referring to Jack Dorseyâ€™s other company, Square. â€œAnd Iâ€™ll stand by the notion that Jackâ€™s a very creative, innovative guy, as well evidenced by the fact that he started two amazing companies.   â€¦     I give him credit for that, and I think nowâ€™s the time to focus down, at least from my perspective, on the stock I own. â€ Breitbart Senior editor MILO predicted the death of Twitter following his suspension from the platform in 2016.

The spokesman for the Hungarian government Zoltan Kovacs defended the new law noting the government had gone to the European Commission for Democracy through Law, also known as the Venice Commission, who had seen no problems with it. The Venice Commission wrote a report on the new law saying it, â€œpursues a prima facie legitimate aim and can be considered to be necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. â€ Kovacs also rejected accusations that the law was mimicking a similar law in Russia saying that the Hungarian law does not require NGOs to register as â€œforeign agentsâ€ and does not take away their public funding. The does, however, force NGOs to say where their funds are coming from and be more transparent. The law is largely seen by many as a continuation of the Hungarian governmentâ€™s crackdown on international NGOs financed by     billionaire George Soros. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has slammed Soros in the past saying that he has agitated within Hungary through NGOs to open the borders for the mass migration of millions into Europe. In a speech at the European Parliament in April, Orban said, â€œGeorge Soros and his NGOs want to transport one million migrants to the EU per year. He has personally, publicly announced this programme and provides a financial loan for it. You could read this yourselves. â€ The Hungarian government has also passed a law that some have charged as targeting the Central European University (CEU) which was founded by Soros. Orban said that it was unfair for the university to be able to issue U. S. degrees without having a campus in the U. S. as it gave it an advantage over all other Hungarian universities. Hungary joins a growing number of other Eastern European countries who have come out against Soros and his NGO network including establishment figures in Romania, Poland, Serbia, Bulgaria and Slovakia.

The deal outlines a faster rise in New York City, but carves out a slow lane for small businesses and surrounding counties. In less prosperous areas north of the city it rises to $12.50 per hour before a state review of the lawâ€™s impact. The minimum wage agreement was part of a broad budget deal that Cuomo announced late on Thursday. He said the plan included 12 weeks of paid family leave and $4.2 billion in tax cuts. The  $147 billion budget caps spending growth at 2 percent. â€œI believe that this is the best plan the state has produced in decades,â€ Cuomo told a news conference in the state capital, Albany. Cuomo has earmarked $100 billion in infrastructure spending in the state. The budget also increases school funding by 6.5 percent to $24.8 billion and freezes tuition at the state university system, SUNY.    The minimum wage has been a controversial element in difficult budget negotiations that threatened to delay the spending plan past the start of the stateâ€™s fiscal year on April 1. The agreement, including the minimum wage, still needs to get approval from lawmakers. Under the terms of the deal the minimum wage would rise from its current $9 per hour to $15 over three years in New York City starting on Dec. 31, 2016. City businesses with up to 10 employees would be given four years to implement the measure. Long Island and Westchester County around New York City would be given six years to push through the increases while the rest of the state would see the minimum wage rise to $12.50 in five years, with indexed increases to $15 possible after review.    There is also a provision to suspend the increases from 2019 if economic conditions worsen. The compromise is a climb down for Cuomo and his fellow Democrats who had pushed for a $15 state-wide minimum and no carve outs for small businesses. Republicans argued that a flat statewide rate could hurt businesses in less wealthy areas. â€œIt may not go to $15. Thereâ€™s no guarantee, thatâ€™s the good thing,â€ said Senator George Amedore, a Republican representing a constituency upstate, who commented on the agreement to Reuters. Phil Steck, a Democratic Party assembly member, who represents a district 165 miles (265 km) north of the city, argued that the opposite was true, and a lower minimum wage would be a blow to the upstate economy. â€œWe have a very strapped economy in upstate New York and the surest way to ensure continued poverty is to run a low wage economy,â€ he said. â€œIf anything, the poorer areas of the state needed an increase in the minimum wage more.â€   The multi-tier solution could also dampen the national drive  for a $15 minimum wage that has gathered pace as Democrats mobilize their base ahead of the presidential election in November. They hailed an important victory when California Governor Jerry Brown and legislators reached an agreement on Monday to raise the stateâ€™s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023. Cuomo said New Yorkâ€™s â€œcalibratedâ€ path to raising the minimum wage could be an example for the rest of the county. â€œIt is raising the minimum wage in a way that is responsible and a positive for the overall economy,â€ he said.", "output": "1.

Robert Bentley resigned Monday, his power and popularity diminished by a sex scandal that staggered the state, brought him to the brink of impeachment and prompted a series of criminal investigations. Ellen Brooks, a special prosecutor, said Mr. Bentley quit in connection with a plea agreement on two misdemeanor charges: failing to file a major contribution report and knowingly converting campaign contributions to personal use. He pleaded guilty Monday afternoon. It was a stunning downfall for the governor, a Republican who acknowledged in March 2016 that he had made sexually charged remarks to his senior political adviser, Rebekah Caldwell Mason. â€œI have decided it is time for me to step down as Alabamaâ€™s governor,â€ Mr. Bentley said at the State Capitol. He did not mention the charges to which he pleaded guilty, or the deal with prosecutors that mandated his resignation. His exit from government and guilty pleas followed mounting calls for his resignation, especially after a report that was made public on Friday said he had fostered â€œan atmosphere of intimidationâ€ and compelled state employees to help him cover up his relationship with Ms. Mason. Impeachment hearings  â€”   the first in Alabama in more than a century  â€”   began Monday morning, when the State House was consumed by rumors that the governor would soon quit. Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey succeeded Mr. Bentley. A former state treasurer, she is the second woman to hold the office. She is a graduate of Auburn University and was a high school teacher and a bank officer before working for the Legislature. â€œThe Ivey administration will be open, it will be transparent and it will be honest,â€ Ms. Ivey said. Mr. Bentley, 74, repeatedly denied having a physical relationship with Ms. Mason and long insisted that he had not broken any laws, but he was a subject of multiple investigations, including reviews by the F. B. I. and the Alabama attorney generalâ€™s office. On Wednesday, the Alabama Ethics Commission said it had probable cause to find that Mr. Bentley had committed felonies, and it asked a district attorney to consider prosecuting him. Two days later, a lawyer hired by the Alabama House of Representatives released a report portraying Mr. Bentley as deceitful and desperate before his relationship with Ms. Mason made him a punch line. The   report said Mr. Bentley had offered little cooperation to legislative investigators, and it alleged that the governorâ€™s critics had been subjected to coercion, including harassing messages and the threat of prosecution. The report described how Mr. Bentley tried to use a member of his security detail to break up with Ms. Mason on his behalf and how he demanded that Ms. Mason be allowed to travel in official vehicles after she left the stateâ€™s payroll. It also explored Mr. Bentleyâ€™s efforts to keep audio recordings of suggestive conversations with Ms. Mason from the public. In one such conversation, which rippled across the internet last year, the governor described embracing Ms. Mason and placing his hands on her breasts. By the weekend, legislative leaders had demanded that the governor quit, echoing a faction of    members in his own party who spent months vocally opposing him. On Sunday night, the steering committee of the Alabama Republican Party made a similar call. And by sunset Monday, Mr. Bentley was out of power. In court documents, the Alabama attorney generalâ€™s office said Mr. Bentley had failed to disclose a $50, 000 personal loan to his campaign account. The office also said Mr. Bentley had allowed nearly $9, 000 of campaign money to be used for Ms. Masonâ€™s lawyers. Mr. Bentley was sentenced to a suspended jail term, fined $7, 000, placed on probation and ordered to complete community service. In an email on Monday, Ms. Mason declined to comment. Yet until Mr. Bentleyâ€™s court appearance, it was unclear that he would actually abandon the job to which he was easily   in 2014. Hours before the special counselâ€™s report became public on Friday, Mr. Bentley repeated his familiar pledge not to resign, and he pleaded for an end to the debate that stemmed from his personal conduct. â€œThe people of this state have never asked to be told of or shown the intimate and embarrassing details of my personal life and my personal struggles,â€ the governor said outside the Capitol. â€œThose who are taking pleasure in humiliating and in shaming me, shaming my family, shaming my friends, well, I really donâ€™t understand why they want to do that. â€ Within days, Mr. Bentley resigned. The decision punctuated a sordid drama that exploded last year, prompting renewed scrutiny of his 2015 divorce from Dianne Bentley, his wife of 50 years. Mr. Bentleyâ€™s complaints and apologies over more than a year did little to quell public outrage in Alabama, where he had cultivated a reputation as an ethically sound public official. Now, he is the first Alabama governor to quit since 1837, when Clement Comer Clay left Montgomery to become a United States senator. (In 1993, Guy Hunt was automatically removed from office after being convicted of an ethics charge he was later pardoned.) Mr. Bentleyâ€™s resignation is the third major transfer of power in Alabama government since June, when the House speaker, Michael G. Hubbard, was convicted of ethics charges and forced from office. Later in the year, Chief Justice Roy S. Moore was suspended for the balance of his term for violating judicial ethics standards. Mr. Bentley, a dermatologist, was a legislative backbencher until he stunned Alabama with his successful campaign for governor in 2010. In the early months of his tenure, he was widely praised for his response to a tornado outbreak that devastated much of the state. His policy legacy, at least among many Republicans, will be mixed. He opposed   marriage and, within months of taking office, approved what was then one of the countryâ€™s most aggressive immigration laws. But he also called for higher taxes and, in 2015, surprised many people when he unilaterally ordered four Confederate flags lowered on the grounds of the State Capitol. He also refused to endorse Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign. But Mr. Bentleyâ€™s personal conduct placed some of the greatest stress on his ties to members of his own party, and those conflicts worsened as he clung to power. â€œItâ€™s sad watching anyone fall,â€ State Representative Corey Harbison, a Republican, said Monday. â€œI hate that it all happened, but Iâ€™m thankful that the governor stepped aside. We can begin to put this behind us. â€", "output": "1. True"}

Bharara said on Saturday he had been fired after he defied a request to resign. The move was a surprise because Bharara had told reporters in November that Trump had asked him to remain in the job. As the chief federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan, Bharara oversaw several  notable corruption and white-collar criminal cases, as well as prosecutions of terrorism suspects. He was one of 46 Obama administration holdovers who were asked to resign by the Justice Department on Friday. Although U.S. attorneys are political appointees, and the request from Trumpâ€™s Justice Department is part of a routine process, the move came as a surprise. Not every new administration replaces all U.S. attorneys at once. The White House declined to comment further on the resignations. The office in the southern district of New York handles some of the most critical business and criminal cases that pass through the federal judicial system. Bharara had been overseeing a probe into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasioâ€™s fundraising. Bharara said his deputy, Joon Kim, would serve as his temporary replacement. The law enforcement source declined comment on whether the office had any active investigations related to Trump. On Wednesday, three watchdog groups asked Bharara to take steps to prevent the Trump Organization from receiving benefits from foreign governments that might enrich Trump, who has not given up ownership of the business. Norm Eisen, a former White House ethics lawyer who leads one of the groups, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, questioned the timing of the firings. â€œI do believe that something odd happened,â€ he said. â€œYou donâ€™t decide to keep 46 folks on, then suddenly demand their immediate exit, without some precipitating cause or causes.â€ Democrat Elijah Cummings, ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, said on Sunday it was the presidentâ€™s prerogative to fire U.S. attorneys. But he questioned why Trump had suddenly changed his mind on keeping Bharara. â€œIâ€™m just curious as to why that is,â€ Cummings said on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€ program.Â â€œCertainly, thereâ€™s a lot of questions coming up as to whether ... President Trump is concerned about the jurisdiction of this U.S. attorney and whether that might affect his future.â€ Republican Senator John McCain said he did not know what promises Trump might have made to Bharara in terms of keeping him on, but he said the president was within his rights to seek the resignation of political appointees from a prior administration. â€œI do know that other administrations have done the same thing, perhaps not in as abrupt a fashion,â€ McCain said on CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Union.â€ â€œElections have consequences, so for people to complain about it they are ignoring the history of new presidencies and I think the president had every right to ask for their resignations,â€ McCain said.", "output": "1.

[The piece by National Council of La Raza President Janet MurguÃ­a, claims Trumpâ€™s plan to deport criminal illegal immigrants build a wall along the southern border and crack down on sanctuary cities will â€œsimilarly tarnish our nationâ€™s characterâ€ like the slave trade did:  Some of the darkest chapters in U. S. history have involved forcibly relocating minority populations: the slave trade, the Trail of Tears, Operation Wetback and the internment of citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent during World War II. Each was considered legal and justified in its time. Now they are condemned as assaults on the values that define our nation. President Trumpâ€™s first executive order on immigration and the draft enforcement memos signed by Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly promise to similarly tarnish our nationâ€™s character. The memos call for expanding the nationâ€™s deportation forces by 15, 000 to round up, detain and deport the undocumented immigrants living among us. Instead of focusing on criminals, they make all undocumented people priorities for enforcement, and through a process called â€œexpedited removal,â€ they severely reduce due process protections. MurguÃ­a says Trumpâ€™s immigration orders through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are based entirely â€œon falsehoodsâ€ about illegal aliens, arguing that illegal immigration is down and it does not pose as much of a threat as the Trump Administration purports. The La Raza president also parroted the talking points that illegal aliens help grow the economy by paying taxes every year: And the cost of the undocumented? Their contributions to the economy far outweigh their burden. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants pay $11. 6 billion in taxes each year. According to the Social Security Administration, undocumented workers contribute $15 billion annually to the fund, but only withdraw an estimated $1 billion. This claim has been repeatedly debunked by groups like the Federation for Immigration Reform (FAIR) which found in a comprehensive study that illegal immigration costs American taxpayers a whopping $113 billion, as Breitbart Texas reported. MurguÃ­a also claims that there is â€œlittle evidence that most undocumented immigrants pose a threat to national security. â€ But, in documents released by the Senate Judiciary Committeeâ€™s subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest back in 2016, research found that there have been 580 individuals convicted of terrorism in the U. S. since the September 11th attacks, with 380 of those individuals being   terrorists, as Breitbart News reported. MurguÃ­a refers to the recent deportation of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, an illegal immigrant living in Phoenix, Arizona, with her two children for 20 years. â€œA woman who was a resident of Phoenix for 20 years was also deported, leaving behind her two U. S.  children,â€ MurguÃ­a writes in the piece. â€œThey are hardly security threats, but will be â€˜enforcement prioritiesâ€™ under Homeland Securityâ€™s new policy. â€ Nonetheless, MurguÃ­a did not mention that Garcia de Rayos had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in 2008 after she was found to be illegally using a Social Security number to work at a theme park, as Breitbart Texas reported.

A violent crackdown by the security forces in response to attacks by militants in the state has caused around 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in recent months.   In a statement posted on the Facebook page of the military s commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the army said the unidentified bodies had been found at the cemetery in the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of state capital Sittwe. It did not say how many bodies were uncovered.    A preliminary investigation was done by the security forces following a report, by someone who asked not to be named, of people being killed and buried,  the army said.    As a result of the investigations, unidentified bodies were found at the Inn Din village cemetery and a detailed investigation is being conducted to get to the truth,  according to the statement on Facebook, which the army often uses to make announcements.   When contacted by Reuters, military spokesman Colonel Myat Min Oo declined to give further details. The village is in Maungdaw township, one of the areas worst affected by the violence that has prompted the United Nations  top human rights official to allege that Myanmar s security forces may have committed genocide against the Rohingya.   Myanmar s armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern Rakhine, where many of the stateless Muslim minority lived, after Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25.   Rights monitors have accused troops of atrocities, including killings, mass rape and arson during those operations. The United States has said it amounted to  ethnic cleansing .   The Myanmar military has said its own internal investigation had exonerated security forces of all accusations of atrocities.   Myanmar s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya.   The civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy announced a probe to address â€œoutstanding questionsâ€ about why former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey publicly disclosed the bureauâ€™s investigation of Clinton but never disclosed one into Trumpâ€™s associates in the 2016 presidential campaign. â€œThese investigations were initiated on a partisan basis, and will shed no light on Russiaâ€™s interference in the 2016 election, but then again they are not intended to do so,â€ Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday in a statement. Instead, said Schiff, â€œthey are designed to distract attention and pursue the Presidentâ€™s preferred goal â€“ attacking Clinton and Obama.â€     Republicans in Congress also are investigating whether officials in former President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration spied on Trumpâ€™s campaign and whether Russians helped pay for a dossier on Trump commissioned by Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm. So far, there is no evidence to support either allegation.    Clinton was Trumpâ€™s Democratic rival in the 2016 U.S.  presidential election and faced questions about her handling of classified material after it became public that she used a private email server in her home for some of her correspondence. Since winning the presidential vote last year, Trump has been beset by questions about Russian efforts to manipulate the U.S. election and whether any of his campaign advisers, some of whom had contacts with Russian officials, were involved. The Republican leaders of the House intelligence and oversight committees on Tuesday announced another new probe, this one into an Obama-era deal in which a Russian company bought a Canadian firm that owned some 20 percent of U.S. uranium supplies. The Republican lawmakers said they want to know if the transaction was fully investigated by the FBI and other agencies before a panel that oversees foreign investment in U.S. strategic assets approved it. Representative Peter King said he sent a letter to then-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner raising â€œvery, very real concerns about why we would allow a Russian-owned company to get access to 20 percent of Americaâ€™s uranium supply.â€ Some Republicans have said Hillary Clintonâ€™s State Department approved the deal after her husbandâ€™s charitable foundation received a $145 million donation. But the State Department has only one seat on the panel that approved the transaction, and the New York Times has reported that Clinton did not participate in the decision. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said late on Tuesday on Twitter that the Justice Department should appoint a special counsel to investigate the uranium deal. All the new investigations address longstanding Trump grievances. The president complained late last week that the news media have ignored the uranium deal while focusing on whether any of his campaign aides colluded with Russia. â€œThatâ€™s your real Russia story,â€ he said. â€œNot a story where they talk about collusion and there was none. It was a hoax.â€ Trump also charged in a Twitter note last week that former FBI Director James Comey had exonerated Clinton long before the bureauâ€™s investigation of her had been completed. â€œObviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?â€ he wrote. After first clearing Clinton in the email probe, Comey announced 11 days before the election that the FBI had begun investigating a newly discovered batch of Clinton emails. Clinton has said Comeyâ€™s letter to Congress on the issue tilted the race to Trump.", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: An attempt by U.S. authorities to identify an anonymous critic of President Donald Trump on Twitter has set off alarm bells among Democratic and Republican lawmakers and civil liberties advocates fearful of a crackdown on dissent.  Twitter Inc on Friday succeeded in beating back a demand for records about a Twitter account called ALT Immigration (@ALT_uscis), which pokes fun at Trumpâ€™s immigration policies and appears to be run by one or more federal employees. The U.S. government withdrew an administrative summons that customs agents had sent the company in March demanding the records. But the government backed away only after Twitter filed a federal lawsuit accusing it of violating the First Amendmentâ€™s protection of free speech. Customs agents could still continue the investigation using some other methods, civil liberties attorneys said. Although authorities retreated, the case has laid bare the broad power of the U.S. government to demand information from technology companies, sometimes with no oversight from the courts and often with built-in secrecy provisions that prevent the public from knowing what the government is seeking.     The summons that Twitter received came from agents who investigate corruption and misconduct within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Even after it was withdrawn, some lawmakers had questions about the agencyâ€™s actions. â€œCBP must ensure that any properly authorized investigation does not disregard the rights to free speech enshrined in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,â€ two Republican U.S. senators, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Mike Lee of Utah, wrote in a letter on Friday to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.  The senators asked whether the agency would ever ask a private company to divulge private records about a customer based solely on â€œnon-criminal speech.â€ Senate Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon called for an investigation of whether customs agents had violated a law by retaliating against an internal critic.  The Department of Homeland Security plans to respond directly to the senators, an official said on Friday. There are two primary ways the U.S. government can obtain information from internet companies without a judgeâ€™s approval using a law known as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, according to experts in privacy law. Agencies with enforcement power, such as the Internal Revenue Service, can issue administrative subpoenas demanding user records. Prosecutors can also ask grand juries investigating a crime to issue a subpoena.  An aggressive agency, for example, might demand information about a Twitter account that used an agency logo on the grounds that it is deceptive, said Georgetown University law professor Paul Ohm. Similarly, a prosecutor could ask a grand jury to issue a subpoena based on the idea that a federal employee, suspected of criticizing the administration anonymously, was misusing government resources. â€œIt doesnâ€™t take a brilliant legal mind to think of hypotheticals,â€ Ohm said. Further, such subpoenas are usually kept secret, making them more difficult to challenge. Some other government tools, such as a national security letter, are intended to be used for narrow purposes related to counter-terrorism investigations. But they do not require judicial approval either, instead relying on internal safeguards. Challenging such demands is difficult and often requires deep pockets, attorneys familiar with such orders said. â€œItâ€™s important to keep in mind how formidable the governmentâ€™s range of investigatory powers is,â€ said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for digital rights. In the case of ALT Immigration, Twitter said it was not bound to keep the summons a secret, and the company informed the account holder of the government demand. That person then found legal representation with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Two months from Election Day, Hillary Clinton has a clear edge over Donald Trump in nearly every measure traditionally used to gauge success in presidential races.\n\nShe's raising huge sums of money and flooding airwaves with television advertisements. A sophisticated data team with a history of winning White House contests is meticulously tracking voters in key battleground states. Clinton also has multiple paths to the 270 electoral votes needed to win in November â€” so many that she could lose Ohio and Florida and still become America's first female president.\n\nBut Trump's campaign believes there are pockets of voters eager to be persuaded not to back Clinton. While Trump squandered a summer's worth of opportunities to court those voters, his campaign heads into the fall suddenly confident in its ability to make up lost ground.\n\nTrump aides were gleeful Friday over the release of FBI notes regarding Clinton's controversial email practices while secretary of state. His campaign plans to come out of the Labor Day weekend wielding the report as a warning about the Democrat's judgment.\n\nGetting Trump to make that kind of consistent case against Clinton has been a herculean task for much of the campaign. But advisers say he's more receptive to his new leadership team's more scripted approach, mostly because it's coincided with a tightening in the public polls he monitors obsessively.\n\n\"There's a renewed focus on Hillary Clinton and her problems, which I think has been beneficial,\" said Matt Borges, the chairman of Ohio's Republican Party. \"He's got to sustain this for another couple weeks.\"\n\nStill, Trump aides acknowledge that the brash businessman needs to more to address his own shaky standing with voters.\n\nTrump's campaign has spent no general election money on positive, biographical ads, despite having plenty of cash to do so. Efforts to highlight a warmer side of the New York real estate developer at the GOP convention were quickly overshadowed by flaps of his own making. He's also angered anew Hispanics voters, a fast-growing segment of the electorate that Republicans are desperate to draw from, by holding fast to his tough immigration policies.\n\n\"He's running up against a population trend and a demographic reality,\" said Steve Schale, a Florida-based Democratic strategist.\n\nIf Trump can reshape the race, he'll need to do so quickly. Early voting begins in some states this month. North Carolinians can start submitting absentee ballots Friday. In Ohio â€” a state no Republican has won the White House without â€” people can start voting on Oct. 12, a week before the last of three presidential debates.\n\nBoth campaigns expect enormous audiences for the debates. Clinton, who has been in intensive study sessions with her debate team in recent days, is sure to face higher expectations from voters. Trump's political inexperience leaves him with a lower bar to clear.\n\nPrivately, Republican leaders say it will take more than strong debates for their nominee to alter a race that appears to be leaning in Clinton's favor. While Trump publicly maintains support from numerous high-ranking GOP officials, a striking number of discussions among Republicans in Washington often begin with an assumption that Clinton will be president come January.\n\nTrump advisers vigorously dispute that the race has slipped from their grasp. They contend most Americans are just now tuning into the presidential campaign in a serious way.\n\n\"We're very much on schedule to do what we need to do to turn out the vote for Mr. Trump,\" said Bob Paduchik, Trump's Ohio state director and one of the most experienced operatives on the Republican's staff. Paduchik said Trump's efforts heading into the fall are focused primarily on rallying \"disaffected Democrats and independents.\"\n\nClinton's campaign has long argued that Trump is overestimating the number of voters willing to switch from voting Democratic in presidential election to Republican. But Clinton aides are monitoring movement toward a pair of third party candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein.\n\n\"There's no question you've got two candidates who are both underwater on their favorables right now,\" Joel Benenson, Clinton's chief strategist and pollster, said by way of explaining the appeal of Johnson and Stein. \"I think it's important as this gets closer that people understand the stakes and the importance of their vote.\"\n\nClinton and running mate Tim Kaine will have an all-star stable of Democrats making that case on their behalf through the fall.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is expected to spend much of October campaigning for Clinton, focusing in particular on increasing turnout among young people, blacks and college-educated whites. Vice President Joe Biden will camp out in working class areas of Ohio and Pennsylvania. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton's vanquished primary rival, will be rallying the young voters and liberals who backed his campaign.\n\nTrump will be largely on his own, with the exception of running mate Mike Pence and a few loyal supporters such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. In the battle for control of the Senate, most Republicans in competitive races have stayed away from Trump.\n\nDemocrats now see a clear path to taking back control of the Senate, with party leaders identifying Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as favorable opportunities to pick up seats. Democrats are also confident that if Clinton wins in some of the most contested state such as New Hampshire, North Carolina and Nevada, she'll bring along the party's Senate candidates.\n\nThere are bright spots for Republicans in the Senate contests. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio is running a campaign that mirrors Clinton's more than Trump's â€” disciplined, well-funded, and heavily centered on data â€” and appears on track to hold his seat, even if Clinton carries the state in the presidential race.", "output": "1.

A day after a   panel rebuffed him, Mr. Trump said he might sign â€œa   orderâ€ as early as Monday that would be aimed at accomplishing the same purpose but, presumably, with a stronger legal basis. While he vowed to keep fighting for the original order in court, he indicated that he would not wait for the process to play out to take action. â€œWe will win that battle,â€ he told reporters on Air Force One as he flew to Florida for a weekend golf outing with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Yet noting that it most likely would not happen quickly, he also raised the possibility of â€œa lot of other options, including just filing a   order. â€ Asked if he would do that, Mr. Trump said, â€œWe need speed for reasons of security, so it very well could be. â€ The presidentâ€™s pivot represented a   tactical retreat even as he insisted that he would prevail in the long run. The battle over his order, which suspended refugee flows and temporarily blocked visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, has come to define Mr. Trumpâ€™s young presidency both at home and abroad, and has tested his capacity to impose his will on a political and legal system that he has vowed to master but that has resisted his demands. Mr. Trump typically prefers a fight, but drafting a new travel order would acknowledge that sometimes a president must find other ways to proceed. Asked to describe what he had in mind for a new executive order, he said: â€œWeâ€™re going to have very, very strong vetting. I call it extreme vetting, and weâ€™re going very strong on security. We are going to have people coming to our country that want to be here for good reason. â€ White House officials denied news reports that the president would not appeal the case to the Supreme Court. â€œAll options remain on the table,â€ Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said by email late Friday. A new version of the executive order would amount to a tacit admission that the administration would not be able to quickly or easily overturn the decision issued on Thursday by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Even some conservative lawyers allied with the White House said there was little chance of prevailing right away with the Supreme Court, which is divided along ideological lines with a seat vacant. Emboldened by the appeals court, Democrats attacked Mr. Trump for trying to subvert American values. â€œI promise you, we will fight back,â€ Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in his partyâ€™s weekly radio and internet address. â€œWe will resist. We will resist on behalf of what is American. And we will resist on behalf of the immigrants who came here in the past and who will come here in the future. â€ Mr. Trump has other ways to soldier on. The Ninth Circuit decision left in place a temporary restraining order blocking the travel order, but did not rule on the underlying constitutional or legal issues of the case. The president could ask the full Ninth Circuit to hear an appeal on the restraining order, or he could return to the lower courts for a battle over the merits, which would take longer to conclude. The administration was still fighting battles in other courts across the nation. Lawyers for the Justice Department were back in court in Alexandria, Va. outside the nationâ€™s capital, arguing against a preliminary injunction that would halt the travel ban from being enforced nationwide. Given multiple challenges, the idea of starting over appealed to the White House. Edward Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and an advocate of Mr. Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote on Twitter that it was â€œutterly crazyâ€ to expect the justices to overturn Thursdayâ€™s ruling. As a result, Mr. Whelan wrote, it would be better to develop a â€œsensibleâ€ executive order and unveil it â€œwith clear expectationsâ€ for carrying it out. The original executive order issued last month barred refugees from anywhere in the world from entering the United States for 120 days and refugees from Syria indefinitely. It also cut off visitors for 90 days from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Mr. Trump said he needed time to tighten screening procedures. White House officials could draft a new order that would address some of the concerns raised by the judges. A new order, for instance, could explicitly state that it did not apply to permanent legal residents holding green cards. After some initial crossed signals, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security have said Mr. Trumpâ€™s original ban does not affect green card holders, but the appeals court judges pointed out that was not in the text of the order. The White House could also narrow the categories of people affected, or change the list of countries targeted. And it could take out provisions intended to give preference to religious minorities, which in Muslim countries would refer to Christians, among others. Mr. Trump said in a television interview that he wanted to give preference to Christian refugees, but the judges expressed concern about a religious rule that could be discriminatory. Mr. Trump has also argued that the restrictions were necessary to stop terrorists from entering the United States, citing attacks in Europe over the past year. As the United States has struggled with terrorism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, no one has been killed in a terrorist attack on American soil by anyone from one of those seven countries  â€”   a point noted by the judges  â€”   although some   attackers from them have been thwarted. The White House could try to offer a stronger rationale for why a temporary ban would actually stop terrorism. In his weekly address, Mr. Trump told Americans he was â€œcommitted to your securityâ€ and would not be deterred by criticism of his order. â€œWe will not allow our generous system of immigration to be turned against us as a tool for terrorism and truly bad people,â€ he said. Mr. Trumpâ€™s attacks on the judiciary have drawn criticism. He initially called a federal district judge in Seattle who first blocked his executive order a â€œ  judgeâ€ and said Americans should blame the judge if there were a terrorist attack. When the appeals court took up the case, he said a â€œbad high school studentâ€ would uphold the order. Mr. Trump started Friday with another attack on the appeals court ruling, calling it â€œa disgraceful decision. â€ But for much of the rest of the day, he avoided the incendiary language he has been using. At a White House news conference with Mr. Abe before flying to Florida, he said he would fight in court, but did not address the judges. Mr. Trump suggested that he had learned more about the threat of terrorism from intelligence briefings since he took office. â€œWhile Iâ€™ve been president, which is just for a very short period of time, Iâ€™ve learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely president,â€ he said. â€œAnd there are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen. I can tell you that right now. We will not allow that to happen. â€", "output": "1. True"}

Turkeyâ€™s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, speaking from Ankara in comments carried by local media, said the second explosion appeared to be in a nearby park, and may have been a suicide bomb. The explosions set off activity around central Istanbul, with rushing ambulances, helicopters hovering, and a large plume of smoke rising over the city, scenes that were as familiar as they were frantic. Like last summerâ€™s attempted coup and a devastating attack at Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, the bombs on Saturday came in the late evening, when this megacityâ€™s streets, bars and restaurants were packed. Shortly after the bombings, Mr. Soylu said that 20 police officers had been wounded. Turkish media later reported that more than a dozen police officers had been killed. Updated casualty numbers were later reported by The Associated Press. Once the news ricocheted around town, revelers hurried home, glued to their mobile phones, amid the sound of sirens. Those closer to the stadium heard screams and the sounds of gunfire. â€œI heard a large explosion and immediately turned around and then there was a second explosion,â€ said Sheri Cavazos, an Istanbul resident who was at a nearby hotel. â€œI immediately thought it was a terrorist attack. I wasnâ€™t surprised. I was expecting it. â€ Images shared on social media showed fires, several cars destroyed and police hats scattered on the ground. But within a couple of hours it seemed clear that a major attack against civilians had not transpired. The bombings occurred after the game was over and most fans had left the area around the stadium. Local media reported that the attack targeted a riot police bus, not a gathering of civilians. Turkey faces numerous security threats, including the Islamic State, which Turkey is fighting in Syria and Iraq as part of an   coalition against the terrorist group, and Kurdish militants who are at war with the Turkish state in the southeast. No group immediately took credit for the attack, although the choice of target  â€”   the police, rather than civilians  â€”   was in line with the types of attacks that have been carried out by Kurdish militants. Over the last four years, Turkey has evolved from a country of stability and prosperity that was trying to lead the Middle East at a time of great turmoil to one that is increasingly consumed by violence and political problems within its own borders. Istanbul, a city of 14 million residents that has thrummed with tourists in recent years, has become a frequent target, with attacks over the last year in the old city and on Istiklal Avenue, the most famous street. Tourism has collapsed, businesses have fled the city center to go to the suburbs, and many trendy restaurants and shops have closed. â€œThis is the new norm now,â€ said Ozan Tas, a taxi driver who was working near the stadium.", "output": "1.

Trump issued an unusual videotaped apology early Saturday after a 2005 recording surfaced that showed him speaking in extraordinarily vulgar terms about women, setting off an uproar in the Republican Party. â€œAnyone who knows me knows these words donâ€™t reflect who I am,â€ he said. â€œI said it, I was wrong, and I apologize. â€ The apology came as the presidential nominee faced extraordinary censure from Republican leaders after the tape was made public. The recording captures Mr. Trump speaking about pushing himself on women and boasting that he could get away with â€œanythingâ€ because of his celebrity. In the   recording, which was obtained by The Washington Post, Mr. Trump recounts to the television personality Billy Bush of â€œAccess Hollywoodâ€ how he once pursued a married woman and â€œmoved on her like a bitch, but I couldnâ€™t get there,â€ expressing regret that they did not have sex. But he brags of a special status with women: Because he was â€œa star,â€ he says, he could â€œgrab them by the pussyâ€ whenever he wanted. â€œYou can do anything,â€ Mr. Trump says. He also said he was compulsively drawn to kissing beautiful women â€œlike a magnetâ€  â€”   â€œI donâ€™t even waitâ€  â€”   and talked about plotting to seduce the married woman by taking her furniture shopping. Mr. Trump, who was 59 at the time he made the remarks, went on to disparage the woman, whom he did not name, saying, â€œI did try and fuck her. She was married,â€ and saying, â€œSheâ€™s now got the big phony tits and everything. â€ On Friday night, Speaker Paul D. Ryan withdrew an invitation for Mr. Trump to appear alongside him in Wisconsin this weekend. Mr. Ryan described himself in a statement as â€œsickenedâ€ by Mr. Trumpâ€™s remarks. Hours before his video apology, Mr. Trump released a statement on Friday afternoon expressing regret â€œif anyone was offendedâ€ by his comments, but he tried to play down the tape as a snippet of â€œlocker room banter. â€ His running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, brushed off the banter at a rally in Rossford, Ohio. â€œTheyâ€™ll say, this time we got him,â€ Mr. Pence said. â€œThis time we got another thing, another issue thatâ€™s come forward. Then they turn on the next television the next morning, and Donald Trump is still standing stronger than ever before and fighting for the American people. â€ But Mr. Pence also telephoned Mr. Trump on Friday night and urged him to show humility, according to an adviser to the nominee who requested anonymity to reveal a private conversation. (Mr. Trump had already decided to apologize when Mr. Pence called, the adviser noted.) Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, issued a statement late Friday night calling on Mr. Trump to express contrition  â€”   and possibly offering other Senate Republicans cover to disavow the nominee if he refused to apologize. â€œAs the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape,â€ Mr. McConnell said. While neither Mr. Ryan nor Mr. McConnell immediately withdrew formal support for Mr. Trump, Republican leaders in Washington held anguished discussions throughout the evening about how the party should proceed with a badly wounded and potentially toxic nominee. They cannot remove their nominee from the ticket, but some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to step down voluntarily, including Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, who previously said he would not support Mr. Trump, and Representatives Mike Coffman of Colorado and Barbara Comstock of Virginia. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who also has not endorsed Mr. Trump, recorded a live video on Facebook in which he asked the candidate, â€œwith all due respect, to step aside. â€ Mr. Trump, seeking to minimize the import of the disclosure despite the public rebuke by Mr. Ryan, announced late Friday evening that he would no longer travel to Wisconsin as planned and would send Mr. Pence in his stead. Mr. Trump said he would spend Saturday preparing for his second debate with Hillary Clinton, set to take place Sunday in St. Louis. Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly attacked and mocked Mrs. Clintonâ€™s marriage in recent weeks, also sought to implicate Bill Clinton in his coarse conduct. â€œBill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course  â€”   not even close,â€ Mr. Trump said in a statement. â€œI apologize if anyone was offended. â€ And in his video apology later, he said: â€œIâ€™ve said some foolish things. But thereâ€™s a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. â€ Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to attack Mrs. Clinton over her husbandâ€™s affairs and how she responded to them. The disclosure of the recording comes at the end of a punishing two weeks, during which Mr. Trump has faced intense backlash over his treatment of women and intensifying scrutiny of his personal finances and views on national security. Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign condemned Mr. Trump forcefully for the comments captured on the recording. Her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, said in response to the remarks, â€œIt makes me sick to my stomach. â€ More Republicans joined in the denunciation, including Gov. Gary Herbert and Representative Jason Chaffetz, both of Utah, who had said this summer that they would vote for Mr. Trump, and on Friday retracted their support. â€œDonald Trumpâ€™s statements are beyond offensive  despicable,â€ Mr. Herbert wrote on Twitter. â€œWhile I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, I will not vote for Trump. â€ Mr. Trump had already been on the defensive on Friday after telling CNN that he still believed the exonerated defendants known as the Central Park Five were guilty of a 1989 rape of a female jogger despite DNA evidence to the contrary that later overturned their convictions. Earlier in the day, he also asserted, again without evidence, that the Obama administration was allowing illegal immigrants to enter the country in order to vote in November. Also in the last week, The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump had declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a tax deduction so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. For Republicans on the ballot this fall, the uproar over Mr. Trumpâ€™s past statements about women touched off an agonizing political cycle, marked by partial denunciations of Mr. Trump  â€”   and demands from Democrats that their denunciations go further. Republican candidates for the House and Senate, and for governorships across the country, chastised Mr. Trump sternly but stopped short of renouncing him as their choice for the presidency. One Republican senator seeking   Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was criticized this week when she called Mr. Trump a role model for children, said his comments were â€œtotally inappropriate and offensive. â€ Ms. Ayotte, one of the most prominent women in the party, was facing immense pressure Friday night from other Republicans to disavow Mr. Trump entirely, and was said to be considering it. In an illustration of the Democratic onslaught, her opponent, Gov. Maggie Hassan, called Mr. Trumpâ€™s comments inexcusable. â€œIt is beyond comprehension how Senator Ayotte could continue to support this man for the highest office in the land, let alone call him a role model,â€ Ms. Hassan said. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has endorsed Mr. Trump, said, â€œThere are no excuses for Donald Trumpâ€™s offensive and demeaning comments. â€ He was clearly worried about how they might affect his own   campaign, adding, â€œHe alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences. â€ Another Republican to turn his back on Mr. Trump on Friday was Jon M. Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, who just a week ago said he planned to vote for Mr. Trump. He told The Salt Lake Tribune that the nominee should withdraw from the race. â€œIn a campaign cycle that has been nothing but a race to the bottom  â€”   at such a critical moment for our nation  â€”   and with so many who have tried to be respectful of a record primary vote, the time has come for Governor Pence to lead the ticket,â€ Mr. Huntsman told the newspaper. Mr. Trumpâ€™s behavior has at times startled and unnerved women in his life, from employees at his company to the contestants in his beauty pageants, The Times found after interviewing dozens of them for an article in May. They described unwanted romantic advances and unending commentary on the female form. Temple Taggart, Miss Utah in 1997, was uncomfortable with how forward Mr. Trump was with young contestants like her in his first year as the owner of Miss USA, a branch of the beauty pageant organization. As she recalls it, he introduced himself in an unusually intimate manner. â€œHe kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, â€˜Oh, my God. Gross.â€™ He was married to Marla Maples at the time,â€ she said. â€œI think there were a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth. I was like, â€œWow, thatâ€™s inappropriate. â€ Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, suggested Mr. Trump had discussed committing a violent crime in his 2005 conversation with Mr. Bush. â€œWhat Trump described in these tapes amounts to sexual assault,â€ said Ms. Laguens. â€œTrumpâ€™s behavior is disgusting and unacceptable in any context, and it is disqualifying for a man who is running for president of this country. â€ The recording of Mr. Trump talking to Mr. Bush was made as they sat on a bus on the set of a soap opera where Mr. Trump was making a cameo appearance. The conversation was recorded after he had married Melania Trump, his third and current wife. At one point, the conversation in the video was interrupted when an actress arrived to take Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush to the set. Mr. Trump seemed excited. â€œYou know Iâ€™m automatically attracted to beautiful  â€”   I just start kissing them,â€ Mr. Trump says. â€œItâ€™s like a magnet. Just kiss. I donâ€™t even wait. â€ Ms. Trump was pregnant at the time that Mr. Trumpâ€™s remarks were recorded in   2005 their son, Barron, was born the next March.", "output": "1. True"}

Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, said she had been asked by federal officials to limit her public comments about the protest which began on Jan. 2 at the remote Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and that she had no wish to escalate the situation. â€œBut I will say this ... The situation is absolutely intolerable and it must be must be resolved immediately. The very fabric of this community is being ripped apart,â€ Brown said on Wednesday at a news conference.  â€œThe residents of Harney County have been overlooked and under-served by federal officialsâ€™ response thus far.â€ The takeover at Malheur was the latest flare-up in the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion, a decades-old conflict over the U.S. governmentâ€™s control of millions acres of land in the West. The occupiers have declared their move is in support of two local ranchers who were returned to prison this month for setting fires that spread to federal land. The ranchersâ€™ lawyer has said the occupiers do not speak for the family.          Law enforcement officials have so far kept their distance from the buildings at the refuge, 30 miles (48 km) south of the small town of Burns in rural southeast Oregonâ€™s Harney County, in the hope of avoiding a violent confrontation. One of the occupiers was arrested last week after he drove a government vehicle to a local supermarket.  Brown called the situation a â€œspectacle of lawlessnessâ€ which must end and said she had conveyed her very grave concerns to the U.S. Department of Justice and the White House. â€œFederal authorities must move quickly to end the occupation and hold all of the wrongdoers accountable,â€ the governor said. â€œAnd until Harney County is free of it, I will not stop insisting that federal officials enforce the law.â€ The chair of the local Native American tribe has also called on the federal government to remove the occupiers. Brown said the standoff was costing Oregon about $100,000 per week, mostly in additional law enforcement costs, and that she has asked her finance officials to â€œscour the budgetâ€ so they could subsidize the expense to Harney County. â€œWe will be asking federal officials to reimburse the state for these costs,â€ she said.", "output": "1.

Many politicians and parents have raised alarms about privacy and warned of predatory boys sneaking into girlsâ€™ bathrooms. But others say that such accommodations are critical protections for a vulnerable population. For all of the heated debate, a central fact remains elusive: How many students are we talking about? No one knows for sure. Researchers have not figured out how to obtain consistent, reliable answers from teenagers, much less younger children. The best estimates are that the population is small, probably under 1 percent of adolescents. There are none. Pediatricians generally do not ask patients about their gender identity, and if they do, they do not usually report findings in national health registries. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which analyzes much of our behavioral health data, has tested ways for students to identify themselves as transgender. But it has not yet settled on a satisfactory method, and it does not expect to include such a question in its adolescent health survey before 2019. Some local surveys have been done, with results falling in a narrow range. A 2015 health behavior survey of 18, 494 high school students in Dane County, Wis. which includes Madison, found that 1. 5 percent of students identified themselves as transgender. In 2006, the Boston Youth Survey asked 1, 032 public high school students, â€œAre you transgender?â€ The responses were 1. 6 percent yes, 86. 3 percent no, and 6. 3 percent â€œdonâ€™t know. â€ An additional 5. 7 percent skipped the question. Some believe that these estimates are low, â€œbecause trans identity has become more salient and acceptance has increased,â€ said Jody L. Herman, a scholar of public policy at the U. C. L. A. School of Lawâ€™s Williams Institute. â€œBut we donâ€™t have any way of knowing that. â€ Interestingly, in surveys, a higher proportion of teenagers than adults tend to identify themselves as transgender. Analyzing adult survey data from Massachusetts and California, the Williams Institute estimated in 2011 that 700, 000 adults, or 0. 3 percent of the national population, were transgender, a number that is frequently cited. Lots of reasons. The situation in which a survey is conducted  â€”   in school a telephone call an   interview  â€”   will influence the candor of the response. So will the wording of the question. In some surveys, for example, students have been asked, â€œDo you identify as: a) male, b) female or c) transgender?â€ â€œThat is a terrible question because you can only select one,â€ said Emily A. Greytak, director of research at G. L. S. E. N. the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network. â€œâ€˜So what do I check? Transgender?â€™ Or theyâ€™ll check girl, because â€˜I want to be a girl.â€™ So you get bad data. â€ And they are, after all, teenagers. â€œYou end up with adolescents who donâ€™t read the question carefully, or who will check â€˜Dâ€™ for everything, or will choose what they think is a   option,â€ said Kerith Conron, a social and psychiatric epidemiologist at the Fenway Institute in Boston, which develops health programs for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, among others. Still, despite all of the imperfect information, researchers have come up with a best estimate for the number of transgender teenagers. â€œWe all have a sense that the number is probably between 0. 5 percent and 1. 5 percent,â€ Dr. Greytak said. The Obama administrationâ€™s directive covers elementary schools, too. But the number of very young children who identify as transgender is even harder to determine. Almost no research has been done on child gender identity. One challenge is that much of the information would have to come from parents. Dr. Conron, who has worked with parents of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths, said, â€œParents often do not know that a childâ€™s gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth until their child, or another person, often in adolescence, tells them so. â€ Some developmental psychologists say that children as young as 2 or 3 can express a gender identity that is at odds with the one defined by their genitalia. But other children take years, even decades, to determine that they are transgender. Younger children whose behavior and preferences may not be solidly masculine or feminine are increasingly called â€œ â€ or â€œ â€ by educators, psychologists and parents. Those who work with transgender students say that school accommodations will affect few students. But the effect for transgender students, they say, is powerful. Many studies have shown that transgender students are a particularly vulnerable group. They are disproportionately affected by bullying and have higher rates of suicide than the population at large. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of documentation about how hunger impacts a kidâ€™s ability to learn, how they canâ€™t concentrate,â€ Dr. Conron said. â€œIn my research with transgender youth, many talk about having to â€˜hold itâ€™ all day because they cannot access an appropriate, safe bathroom. Can you imagine how not being able to void would impact oneâ€™s ability to concentrate and succeed at school?â€", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Yet the problems do remain â€œblack and whiteâ€ for reasonsÂ ofÂ economicÂ exploitation and isolation that run deeper than race itself and that are gathering force, despite rising numbers of white/Asian and white/Hispanic marriages and of multiracial children, even in the families of police officers themselves. Unless we can face the reasons why more â€œdiversityâ€ in police ranks is aÂ far-from-sufficient condition of justice,Â American societyÂ will remain more racist than many others, and thereby hangs my tale.\n\nShortly before Christmas 1996 in the lower-middle-class Queens neighborhood of East Elmhurst, robbers killed Officer Davis as he tried to protect Ira Epstein, the white owner of a check-cashing store where Davis was moonlighting as a security guard to earn extra money to buy holiday gifts for his 6-year-old daughter, Arielle.\n\nBecause Davis was off-duty at the time, itâ€™s unclear if his assailants knew that he was a police officer. But because he was one and was murdered for doing what police officers do, his Episcopal funeral Mass in Garden City, Long Island, was a familiar â€œtableau of pomp and grief,â€ as the New York Times put it, with thousands of saluting, white-gloved, white-ethnic officers and a flyover by police helicopters.\n\nâ€œArielle, your daddy, who loved you, who adored youâ€¦will always be a hero of New York City,â€ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani told Davisâ€™ daughter from the church pulpit. He asked the congregation to give Arielle something she would remember, and all present responded with a long, wrenching ovation. Noting that Ira Epsteinâ€™s widow had called Davis a role model for the cityâ€™s youth, Giuliani said, â€œShe was right,â€ adding that, â€œWhen [Davis] died Saturday morning he was doing what he was trained to do â€“ he was trying to protect another man.â€\n\nMany funerals of New York City police officers killed in action have been tableaus not only of pomp and grief but of the chasm that yawns between an â€œoccupying armyâ€ of mostly white-ethnic officers and an â€œunderclassâ€ of inner-city, black and Hispanic men. I spent enough time there in the late 1970s to have wished that the sea of blue around Davisâ€™ funeral â€” and now those of officers Ramos and Liu â€” would signify something better than a chasm.\n\nBut does it? Or have the examples set by Davis, Liu and Ramos on police forces given the rest of us excuses to rationalize the continuing, calculated, heavily policed and seemingly bottomless isolation of millions of black and Hispanic men and women? Are economic isolation and social stigmatization still driving some of the isolated â€” and those who police them â€” so crazy that itâ€™s a wonder there arenâ€™t even more police killers like those who killed Davis, Liu and Ramos?\n\nRamos and Wuâ€™s killer, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, was a perversely politicized, vengeance-crazed black man. Even the slaying in Ferguson of an unarmed black man, Michael Brown, by white officer Darren Wilson has a symbolic but no less telling opposite (Wilsonâ€™s nightmare) in another Ferguson â€“ Colin Ferguson, a perversely politicized, vengeance-crazed black man who, shortly before Christmas, 1993, boarded a suburban Long Island commuter train and shot 23 white passengers, killing six.\n\nAlthough he killed no cops, many New York officers live on Long Island, whose suburban towns their parents or grandparents chose over New York Cityâ€™s tenements and row homes in the 1960s while seeking greener pastures in the booming, postwar economy and insulation from racially changing inner-city neighborhoods and rising black crime. As Newsdayâ€™s Jimmy Breslin put it a day after Fergusonâ€™s train massacre: â€œLast night, Brooklyn followed them home.â€\n\nAre these officers and prosecutors to blame for provoking their killersâ€™ isolation and rage? Or are they really doing only what our democracy seemingly wants and expects them to do: keep the lid on blacks and Hispanics who are cheated and sidelined, as the rest of us look the other way and disclaim responsibility â€“ an evasion that seems easier to some whenever a Brinsley or a Colin Ferguson explodes?\n\nIn a strange irony, Charles Davis probably reinforced white innocence because he was a generous cop, popular with other officers and with residents of the Queens neighborhood where he supervised youth basketball games and a club for kids who might want to join the NYPD. His large presence, sharp eye and caring strengthened the community policing that had helped to cut New York Cityâ€™s murder rate in half in less than five years, to below 1,000 for the first time in three decades. (By 2013, that number would plummet to just over 300, and this year it may be even lower, notwithstanding predictable predictions of doom 11 months ago by Rupert Murdochâ€™s New York Post and the Patrolmenâ€™s Benevolent Association that Mayor Bill De Blasioâ€™s curbing of excessive NYPD â€œstop and friskâ€ practices would unleash mayhem.)\n\nBut if Davisâ€™ blue uniform and the blue sea at his funeral signified something better than black-versus-white, that equation took a perverse turn as Queens District Attorney Richard Brown orchestrated the indictment of 19-year-old George Bell, a stock boy at Old Navy who lived with his mother and had no criminal background, and two other black men, as Davisâ€™ killers. A recent Nation magazine review of the case by Hannah Riley, a former researcher at the Innocence Project and a student of criminology at the University of Cambridge, raises serious doubts that the men convicted and still in prison for killing Davis were really his murderers.\n\nD.A. Brownâ€™s zeal in convicting them may have been fortified by the fact that Davisâ€™ wife had been an assistant district attorney, albeit in another jurisdiction. But all prosecutors who face high-profile, highly charged cases have other, more-powerful incentives to â€œresolveâ€ them irresponsibly. New Yorkers would be reminded of that in 2002, when the four black men and one Hispanic man whoâ€™d been convicted and imprisoned in 1989 amid public outrage over the infamous assault and rape of the Central Park Jogger were released after years of unjustified incarceration after the real assailant confessed.\n\nSuch things happen partly because D.A.s win reelection by pandering to angry, frightened votersâ€™ hunger for revenge and because police officers are literally the prosecutorsâ€™ comrades in arms and their witnesses before grand juries and in open trials. (The over-zealous assistant prosecutors and detectives complicit in both the Central Park jogger and Davis cases were women, by the way.) But Hannah Riley has found a would-be whistle-blower in retired NYPD detective Pete Fiorillo, who had been pleased at first to see Giuliani touting the work of other detectives in the case and whoâ€™d had, as he put it, â€œno intention of looking at it for the purpose of taking it apart.â€\n\nâ€œBut the more he learned,â€ Riley explains, â€œthe more his doubts grew until he became convinced that the investigation and trial were irredeemably flawed. â€˜This case represents a total breakdown of the criminal justice system from the bottom to the top: the police that investigated this case; the DA that prosecuted the case; the judge that tried all three cases,â€™ said Fiorillo. â€˜They just didnâ€™t have the courage to do the right thing.â€™â€\n\nGiuliani, himself an infamously zealous former prosecutor, told the public after Davisâ€™ murder that, â€œIf you shoot and kill a New York City police officer, the Police Department is going to catch you, theyâ€™re going to find you, usually in a short period of time, and then at a minimum youâ€™re going to spend the rest of your life in jail. And in this particular situation, itâ€™s quite possible youâ€™ll get executed.â€\n\nThe word â€œexecutionâ€ had a dark double-entendre here, giving the â€œblue over blackâ€ equation another perverse twist: Prosecutorial railroading involves not only beguiling or coercing helpless and apparently hopeless young black and Hispanic men into confessions and eventual convictions, and not just complicity by grand juries whose secrecy sanitizes such orchestrations. It also involves finding excuses for officers who are spared indictment time and again â€” even after summarily executing unarmed and even unresisting black and Hispanic men and, in some cases, women.\n\nLike most New Yorkers watching the Central Park and Davis cases, I was inclined to trust prosecutors and to assume the justice of the convictions. When reporters on the Davis murder were told that the 19-year-old Bell had been heard humming the song, â€œHave Yourself a Very Merry Christmasâ€ during a break in the questioning at the 109th Precinct and that remorse seemed never to enter his mind, I assumed that he was yet another half-crazed casualty of inner-city isolation, the kind of casualty Iâ€™d encountered more than once.\n\nIn the late 1970s I ran a weekly newspaper serving poor neighborhoods just across Brooklynâ€™s Broadway and Flushing Avenue from Bedford-Stuyvesant, where Officers Ramos and Liu were killed; I made more than a few visits to the Tompkins Houses along Myrtle Avenue, outside of which the murders occurred, and to Woodhull Hospital, where they were brought with Brinsley, who committed suicide nearby. Just to the northeast lay Bushwick, a once-tidy, German and Italian white-ethnic neighborhood that had become mostly Hispanic and black in the 1960s in ways and for reasons I knew intimately and that I portray in my book â€œThe Closest of Strangers,â€Â two of whose chapters chronicle North Brooklynâ€™s ravaging by absentee landlordsâ€™ â€œblock-bustingâ€ welfare-subsidy scams, rampant arson for profit and for revenge, and massive looting during a huge 1977 power blackout.\n\nOn two occasions I navigated the devastation all night with officers of Bushwickâ€™s 83rd Precinct, accompanying them into scenes of domestic violence where terrified toddlers sucking on teething rings crawled across shattered plates and splattered dinners to hide behind sofas as their mothers told us why theyâ€™d called 911 out of desperation and sometimes for revenge. Sometimes the man was still there, and officers had to take him outside. Out on the street in the noisy, sulfurous darkness, a black-Hispanic youth sauntered up to the patrol carâ€™s open window and taunted one of my hosts by asking, â€œYou Officer Torsney? Gonna shoot me?â€ â€” referring to Robert Torsney, who on Thanksgiving Day in 1976, for no apparent reason, had fired a bullet into the head of Randolph Evans, 15, a ninth grader at Franklin K. Lane High School, outside the Cypress Hills housing project, near where Officer Rafael Ramos was buried last Saturday. As New York Times columnist Bob Herbert noted years later, â€œTorsney would later claim he had been afflicted with a rare form of epilepsy that, remarkably, had never been noticed before the killing and was never seen after it. The â€˜epilepsyâ€™ defense worked. Officer Torsney was acquitted of any wrongdoing.â€ Herbertâ€™s column, â€œThe Sickness in the NYPD,â€Â is worth reading, if only for the experience of rubbing your eyes in disbelief. Another of its offerings: â€œOne April morning in 1973 a veteran police officer named Thomas Shea pulled his service revolver and blew away a young black boy on a street in Jamaica, Queens. He shot the kid in the back. There was no chance of survival. Afterward, no one could figure out why the officer had done it. There was no reason for the shooting, no threat to Officer Shea of any kind. The boyâ€™s name was Clifford Glover and he was 10 years old. Officer Shea was charged with murder but of course he was acquitted.â€ For every young man whom killers in uniform execute as unambiguously as they did Randy Evans, Clifford Glover, Eric Garner and many others without being indicted for it, still more essentially hapless, helpless people are packed off into the vast archipelago of incarceration that employs thousands of â€œcorrectionsâ€ officers. Either way, for the rest of us, itâ€™s out of sight, out of mind, as were the hundreds of homeless people and derelicts about whom few New Yorkers asked when they disappeared from Manhattanâ€™s streets during Giulianiâ€™s mayoralty. If at the bottom of it all is the calculated isolation and impoverishment of blacks and Hispanics that I chronicled while climbing stairwells in Brooklynâ€™s Bushwick-Hylan and Borinquen Plaza housing projects to distribute our paper, next to that bottom are the cops we assign to keep the lid on it. Is it a wonder that they sometimes say that they feel like â€œgarbage collectorsâ€ and that, when the â€œgarbageâ€ call them something worse, some of them explode? In the 1960s, insouciant, pseudo-insurgent, middle-class white youths called cops â€œpigs.â€ A police union took out an ad saying, â€œNext time you really need help, try calling a pig.â€ But, with a very few, spectacular exceptions like the Brinks armored car robbery, the worst thing that white kids did to cops in those days was call them names. Is it really surprising that some cops and corrections officers feel as trapped in neighborhoods like Bushwick as the people theyâ€™re charged with containing? Is it surprising that some of the young white men who are drawn to such work grew up marinating what I described here three weeks ago as ressentiment, the social pathology of a society that has begun to countenance torture abroad and the militarization of police at home against a decadent, demoralized populace that has come to include themselves? Or that, at the funeral of Rafael Ramos, stunted citizens like these would turn their backs on the chief executive of the democracy that employs them, and that they would thereby dishonor the fallen officer and flout civilian leadership of the police and the military as if they would prefer a police state? The surprise is that so many police officers are still as good as Davis and as the relatives of Salonâ€™s own Joan Walsh, as she recounted here vividly this week and in her bookÂ â€œWhatâ€™s the Matter With White People?â€ I, too, can testify that there are many officers, of all colors and backgrounds, as generous and effective as Charles Davis. In the mid-1990s, Peter Mancuso, a former NYPD sergeant, Marine combat veteran, and longtime police reformer, introduced me to other impressive colleagues while I was a columnist for the New York Daily News, a paper many cops read while sitting in their patrol cars. The officers I met were better, more proactive citizen-leaders than moralists who simply cluck their tongues at them. On the other hand, whenever I wrote columns like this one praising their reform efforts, I got some unexpected visits from the New York Fire Department, whose firefighters banged loudly on my door at 3 a.m. because someone had called in a false alarm a day or two after the column ran. Soon after the chokehold killing of Eric Garner, but before the assassinations of Liu and Ramos, another retired police officer sent me this video, distributed by anonymous officers who seem to be preparing for race war, that depicts black men maiming and murdering cops in realistic street scenes. Some of the scenes look staged, but if Brinsleyâ€™s real deed had been filmed it would have fit perfectly into this alarmist, racist montage. The officer who shared it with me calls it â€œalmost a counter-training device. Its message is, â€˜Never mind what we are about to tell you the law says; here is what you are up against at any moment.â€™ After seeing it, I can better understand that young Housing Division Officer opening stairwell doors with his gun in his hand [and, trigger-happy, shot and killed an unarmed, innocent 28-year-old black man two floors below him]. Iâ€™m wondering if he saw the video or something like it.â€™â€ (Before calling 911 to aid the man heâ€™d shot, the housing officer called his union.) Officersâ€™ testimony in cases like this and Eric Garnerâ€™s and Randy Evansâ€™ and Clifford Gloverâ€™s and the rest is almost transparently scripted by the union. Another irony. Even as the rogue video and the real deeds of Brinsley and Colin Ferguson alarm us, and even as some officersâ€™ turning their backs on the mayor at a funeral and a police graduation ceremony disgust us, many black leaders have been ascending a far-better learning curve from the demagoguery of the 1980s and â€˜90s to more sophisticated, humane strategizing. Where now are the Louis Farrakhans, the Vernon Masons and Alton Maddoxes (lawyers of Tawana Brawley infamy) and the Johnnie Cochrans, whose verbal threats and courtroom tactics sent chills down whitesâ€™ spines? Al Sharpton, whom I knew well in those years and described here in November, has climbed that learning curve: He said that the Ferguson, Missouri, protest movement â€œwas not about Darren Wilsonâ€™s job. It was about Michael Brownâ€™s justiceâ€¦. We are not anti-police. If our children are wrong, arrest them. Donâ€™t empty your gun and act like you had no other way.â€ Sharpton also led Eric Garnerâ€™s family in protesting Brinsleyâ€™s deed and mourning the deaths of officers Ramos and Liu. Sharpton is a flawed leader, but efforts by Fox Newsâ€™ flunkies to blame him and recent protesters for bad relations with police prove only that black leadershipâ€™s learning curve has been offset by some white male degeneration along the lines I sketched here. The glorious funerals given officers Davis, Liu and Ramos donâ€™t dispel these white menâ€™s growing bewilderment, fear and anger, less of it generated by black men than by economic and cultural riptides that would still dispossess and disorient many of them even if the U.S. were white from coast to coast. To overcome racism, weâ€™ll have to reach past â€œblack and whiteâ€ story lines and find strategies that free the oppressed by freeing the oppressor. Police are trapped in the swamp I navigated in Brooklyn because all of us are trapped in a political economy thatâ€™s no longer legitimate or sustainable. Unless we confront what Joan Walsh is telling us has happened to the white working Â and middle classes, and what AlterNet editor Don Hazen, economist James GalbraithÂ and historian Eli Zaretsky are trying to tell us about the real roots of Americaâ€™s white male problem, â€œblack and whiteâ€ explanations will fall short, on both sides of an enduring race line that leads us nowhere.", "output": "1.

A criminal investigation is under way into the causes of the fire, while a separate public inquiry is also going on to establish whether there were failures in planning, construction, maintenance or other aspects of the tower s history.

In a report on housing and inequality in the borough, she wrote that most children displaced by the fire were still in emergency accommodation five months later even though it was unlawful to keep them in such accommodation for longer than six weeks. The Conservative-run local authority, Kensington and Chelsea Council, denied that the slow pace of re-housing people was due to any failure on its part. A spokesman said the process was tailored to the bereaved and going at their own pace. Of the 206 households from the tower itself and from nearby Grenfell Walk who needed new homes, 28 have moved into permanent homes while 49 have moved into temporary ones, the council said. It said a total of 178 children were still in emergency accommodation, including living with friends, in hotels or in serviced apartments. Dent Coad dismissed the suggestion that any of the families were still in emergency accommodation out of choice. She said she had visited many families and they were all desperate to move into a permanent home. The problem, she said, was that they were not being offered suitable homes.

Now that the courtâ€™s prior decision is no longer effective, it will be easier for the FTC to protect consumersâ€™ online privacy. â€ The Appeals Court opinion last year relied on the Obama   FCCâ€™sissuing of a massive   regulatory grab in March 2015, referred to â€œNet Neutrality. â€ The order reclassified the treatment of broadband Internet from a growing competitive industry to â€œcommon carrierâ€ monopolies, like the old American Telephone and Telegraph. The original appeals court decision last year dramatically altered the regulatory boundaries between the FTCâ€™s and FCCâ€™s authority over phone companies and other common carriers. It dismissed the FTCâ€™s unfair act or practice suit against ATT for not disclosing it was â€œthrottlingâ€ data transfer speeds for customers that paid for unlimited wireless data plans. Breitbart News noted that Republican FCC member Ajit Pai tweeted in 2015that President Barack Obamaâ€™s Net Neutrality scheme was aimed at the federal government   the Internet to extract billions of dollars in new consumer taxes, and rigidly to enforce progressivesâ€™ idea of honest, equitable, and balanced content fairness.", "output": "1.

Despite Trumpâ€™s endorsement for Moore, some polls suggest Democrat Doug Jones, 63, a former U.S. attorney, could pull off an upset victory by becoming the first non-Republican to be sent to the Senate by deeply conservative Alabama in two decades. Steve Bannon, Trumpâ€™s former chief strategist and executive at the right-wing Breitbart News site, joined Moore in Midland City for the Monday night rally, labeled a â€œDrain the Swampâ€ event, in an echo of Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign pledge to get rid of Washington insiders. â€œI want to make America great again with President Trump,â€ Moore said. â€œI want America great, but I want America good, and she canâ€™t be good until we go back to God.â€ Moore, a 70-year-old conservative Christian and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, has been accused by several women of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one woman who said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore has denied any misconduct. Reuters has not independently verified any of the accusations. The Alabama race has divided Trumpâ€™s Republican Party. The sexual misconduct accusations prompted many senior Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to distance themselves from Moore. â€œThereâ€™s a special place in hell for Republicans who should know better,â€ Bannon told the rally, framing the Alabama election as a showdown between establishment elites and populist power. A Fox News Poll conducted on Thursday and released on Monday put Jones ahead of Moore, with Jones potentially taking 50 percent of the vote and Moore 40 percent. Fox said 8 percent of voters were undecided and 2 percent supported another candidate. An average of recent polls by the RealClearPolitics website showed Moore ahead by a slight margin of 2.2 percentage points. Trump taped a â€œrobo-callâ€ that the campaign has rolled out urging voters to back the Republican candidate in order to help support the presidentâ€™s agenda. Democrats also made robo-calls using two of their partyâ€™s own big guns", "output": "1. True"}

Talks about North Korea are expected to dominate a trip that will include a stop in Beijing, where Trump is expected to pressure China s leadership to act more decisively against Pyongyang. China is North Korea s major ally and trading partner.  Rather than dialogue it is necessary to cause North Korea to change policies by raising the pressure to the maximum,  Abe said in a joint announcement with Stoltenberg.

In a speech to students at the London School of Economics, Guy Verhofstadt said Brexit was negative and a waste of time and energy, though he also said Britain s decision to leave the bloc was a failure for the European Union.  I think she chose Florence because Florentine politics in the 15th century made her feel at home,  Verhofstadt said with a smile.  Backstabbing, betrayal, noble families fighting for power... It is an environment that she recognized fairly well.  He said the one positive outcome of Brexit was that the mood in the EU had reversed since Britain s vote to leave in June 2016 and that now many EU citizens did not want to destroy the Union. After May formally notified the EU in March of Britain s intention to leave the EU, the two sides have about a year left to negotiate the terms of the divorce and the outlines of the future relationship before it is due to leave in March 2019.  Both sides need an agreement to keep trade flowing between the world s biggest trading bloc and the fifth largest global economy, though some chief executives and diplomats fear what they term a disorderly Brexit without a deal. May had hoped that a speech she made in Florence on Friday would unblock the three-month-old talks and pave the way for the EU to open discussions on a post-Brexit free trade deal.  The EU and Britain made progress in the latest round of divorce talks, but not enough to move to the next phase of discussions on a transition period after Brexit or a future trade deal, top negotiators said on Thursday. When Verhofstadt was asked whether he thought a deal could ultimately be done on Brexit, he said:  That s the assumption that I have and it is towards that that we work.   And that a withdrawal agreement be done in March 2019 means that there has to be an agreement in fact in October or November because then the agreement will go to the European Parliament and we need four or five months,  he said.  After what he termed the  failure  of Brexit, Verhofstadt said the EU needed a major overhaul to give the euro zone a government with its own fiscal capacity and its own treasury and finance minister.  We need a management or government of this euro zone with a fiscal capacity, that is in my view the most important. And with a fiscal capacity, normally, you can also give out loans,  he said, adding that some type of euro securities could be issued at some point in the future.", "output": "1. True"}

Trump on Sunday sought to capitalize on the mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, reiterating his controversial call for a temporary ban on Muslim migration to the United States and criticizing Hillary Clinton for what he claimed was her desire to â€œdramatically increase admissions from the Middle East. â€ In a demonstration of his willingness to flout convention and engage in a style of demagogic politics rarely displayed by a presidential nominee, Mr. Trump claimed he had warned of the sort of terrorism that marked the shooting, which killed 50 and was the worst in the countryâ€™s history. â€œI said this was going to happen  â€”   and it is only going to get worse,â€ Mr. Trump said in a statement, arguing that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s presidency would mean â€œhundreds of thousandsâ€ more Middle East migrants. â€œAnd we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing,â€ said Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican  . The suspected gunman, Omar Mateen, was an American who declared allegiance to the Islamic State and was the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan. Mr. Trump extended his opprobrium to that   heavily Muslim country by noting the wide support there for Shariah law. In a separate statement on Twitter, Mr. Trump said that the rampage in Orlando â€œis just the beginningâ€ and noted that he â€œasked for the banâ€ on Muslim immigration to America. He has made his hard line against Muslims central to his campaign, and, even after becoming the presumptive nominee and turning to a broader electorate, refused to fully back off from his call to temporarily halt Muslims from traveling to America. Mr. Trump has faced widespread condemnation for this stance from both Mrs. Clinton and numerous Republicans, but, as he did again Sunday, he has said such vigilance was necessary and that the country â€œcanâ€™t afford to be politically correct. â€ To this end, he said Mrs. Clinton should quit the presidential race if she proved unwilling to acknowledge that the attack in Orlando was the result of â€œtwo words: radical Islam. â€ Mrs. Clinton did not use that phrase or respond directly to Mr. Trumpâ€™s broadsides. Her campaign instead sought to use the event to diminish their Republican rival. â€œThis act of terror is the largest mass shooting in American history and a tragedy that requires a serious response,â€ Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s communications director said, adding that: â€œDonald Trump put out political attacks, weak platitudes and  . â€ Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, initially responded with caution Sunday morning after early reports about the assault, offering her thoughts to those affected â€œas we wait for more information. â€ But after President Obama spoke in the afternoon, and called the Orlando killings an â€œact of terror,â€ she issued a longer statement echoing the president. â€œThis was an act of terror,â€ Mrs. Clinton said. In her statement, Mrs. Clinton said â€œwe need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad,â€ focusing on the threat of terrorism. Further down in her statement, she called for more stringent restrictions on guns. â€œFinally, we need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals,â€ she said, taking up the call many on the left made in the hours after the attack. Mr. Trump, who made no mention of access to firearms in any of his comments, said Mr. Obama should resign for his own refusal to say â€œradical Islam. â€ The White House declined to comment on Mr. Trumpâ€™s demand for the presidentâ€™s resignation. A tragedy in the middle of a presidential race would typically force restraint on candidates. But this tradition has largely vanished in the era of the superheated, social media news cycle, where mass shootings immediately set off debates about access to guns and, if the perpetrator is Muslim, Islamist terrorism. And if the Orlando massacre was a test of how willing candidates and their supporters are to pursue partisan attacks in the aftermath of horrific violence, Mr. Trump left little doubt about his willingness to push the boundaries of the countryâ€™s public discourse. He had no public events Sunday and, in a rarity, did not appear on any of the weekly political talk shows. But he made ample use of his Twitter account, where he said: â€œappreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism. â€ It was a vivid illustration of how little heed Mr. Trump pays to traditional political standards, whether it is on how campaigns are waged or on the kinds of positions he embraces. But there were few Republicans criticizing him for his Muslim ban proposal on Sunday. Mr. Trump had planned a speech on Monday in New Hampshire focused on what he sees as the Clintonsâ€™ ethical lapses. But he indicated in his statement on Sunday that he would use the appearance to â€œfurther address this terrorist attack, immigration, and national security. â€ If Mr. Trump was characteristically bellicose in his response, Mrs. Clinton was typically restrained. She used her statement to make clear she recognized that the country had suffered yet another act of terrorism, but also made sure to offer her solidarity with the gay community and reiterate her support for gun control. She was also off the campaign trail for the day, but avoided Twitter blasts and refrained from making any extended public comment until after the president delivered his remarks in the White House briefing room. Mrs. Clinton was also planning to give remarks Monday lacerating her rival. She had planned to speak about what she deems as Mr. Trumpâ€™s dangerous demagogy at an appearance in Ohio. It is unclear whether Mrs. Clinton will use her speech to forcefully confront Mr. Trump. Mrs. Palmieri, the campaign aide, said Mrs. Clinton would discuss â€œsteps she would take to keep the country safeâ€ in the coming days and another aide said the candidate intended to refashion her address Monday to focus on the terrorism in Orlando. What is clear is that the shooting will reorient the race for at least the next week. Mrs. Clinton was to have held a campaign rally with Mr. Obama in Green Bay, Wis. on Wednesday, her first joint appearance with the president. But she quickly postponed the event on Sunday after the severity of the shooting became clear.", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Britain and the European Union struck a divorce deal on Friday that paves the way for arduous talks on future trade ties, easing immediate pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May and boosting hopes of an orderly Brexit. May rushed to Brussels before dawn to seal a European Commission agreement that  sufficient progress  had been made to begin talks about trade and a two-year Brexit transition period that will start when Britain leaves the EU on March 29, 2019. Negotiators in London, Brussels and Dublin worked through the night before breaking an impasse over the status of the Irish border, the last major obstacle to the opening of trade talks which EU leaders are due to bless at a summit on Dec. 15. But though the Irish prime minister called a British pledge to avoid a destabilising  hard border  for Northern Ireland a  bullet-proof  commitment, one senior EU official conceded that wording to appease May s Belfast allies was a  fudge  which had simply put off until later the need to  square the circle . While Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the rules of the EU s single market and customs union under which member state Ireland operates, May s government is officially committed to leaving both the single market and customs union.  Actual negotiations on a trade pact that may take several years to agree may not start for some months. But EU officials said they should be ready to start rapid talks in January to give May the transition period she wants to reassure business that not much will change for a couple of years after Brexit. Speaking before sunrise at the EU executive s headquarters after a hurried flight on a Royal Air Force plane, May said opening up trade talks would bring certainty for citizens and businesses about Britain s future after quitting the EU.  The most difficult challenge is still ahead,  European Council President Donald Tusk cautioned.  We all know that breaking up is hard. But breaking up and building a new relationship is much harder.  May, looking weary after just a couple of hours sleep, spoke after Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker announced the breakthrough, first in English and then in German and French. The move to agree trade talks 18 months after the United Kingdom s shock vote to exit the EU allayed some fears of a disorderly Brexit that could disrupt trade between the world s biggest trading bloc and its sixth-largest national economy. Sterling was dented when last-minute objections from Belfast forced May to abort a deal on Monday while already in Brussels, but it climbed to a six-month high against the euro EURGBP=D3 on Friday. It later gave up earlier gains and turned lower on the day against the EU common currency as investors took profits after a sharp rally in recent days.     Facing 27 other members of the bloc, May largely conceded to the EU on the structure, timetable and substance of the negotiations. Moving to talks about trade and a Brexit transition was crucial for May s own future after her premiership was thrown into doubt when she lost the ruling Conservative Party its majority in an unwisely called snap election in June.  I very much welcome the prospect of moving ahead,  said May, a 61-year-old Anglican vicar s daughter who herself voted to stay in the EU in the June 2016 referendum but has repeatedly insisted Britain will make a success of Brexit. A senior British banker said the deal signalled May would stay in power for now and that Britain was heading toward a much closer post-Brexit relationship with the EU than many had feared.  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar agreed.  ...What phase one was always about was narrowing the parameters, and we are now funnelling and directing things into a situation where I believe the United Kingdom including Northern Ireland will remain in alignment with the EU on lots of regulations,  he told Irish national broadcaster RTE on Friday evening. Heralding pitfalls ahead, however, Scotland s leader Nicola Sturgeon swiftly cited the promise of free trade on the Irish border as removing an argument used to dissuade Scots from breaking their union with England to rejoin the European Union. Draft guidelines showed the transition period, which would start on March 30, 2019, could last around two years, as May has requested. During that time, Britain will remain part of the EU s customs union and single market but no longer take part in EU institutions or have a vote.  It will also still be subject to EU law.   Pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers rallied around her after the deal. This looked like a signal that the party, which has been split over EU membership for generations, was not preparing to ditch her immediately despite the election fiasco in June that left her government dependent on the support of Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who spearheaded the 2016 Brexit campaign, congratulated May, adding that Britain would now take back control of its laws, money and borders. Supporters of a radical Brexit were tougher. Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage struck a jarring note saying it was extraordinary a British premier had conceded so much in the middle of the night, agreeing to all the demands of Juncker, Tusk and EU negotiator Michel Barnier.  The British prime minister has to fly through the middle of the night to go and meet three unelected people, who condescendingly say:  Now, jolly well done May, you ve met every single one of our demands, thank you very much, we can now move on to the next stage .  Asked for an example of the EU conceding something to London, which says it will pay 40-45 billion euros over many years to meet EU obligations, Barnier said Brussels dropped a demand that Britain bear relocation costs for two EU agencies that are leaving London", "output": "1.

Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge from Colorado seen as a conservative intellectual, began holding private meetings with senators, starting with top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell, to drum up support for his nomination a day after Trump picked  the 49-year-old for a lifetime job on the countryâ€™s top court. Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans control the Senate 52-48. Democrats signaled on Wednesday they would set up a procedural hurdle, known as a filibuster, requiring 60 votes, rather than a simple majority, to move toward confirmation of Gorsuch. The president urged McConnell to change long-standing Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, a move dubbed the â€œnuclear option,â€ if Democrats block Gorsuch. â€œWe want to have him (Gorsuch) go through an elegant process as opposed to a demeaning process, because theyâ€™re very demeaning on the other side, and they want to make you look as bad as possible,â€ Trump said, referring to Democrats. â€œIf we end up with that gridlock, I would say: â€˜If you can, Mitch, go nuclear,â€™â€ Trump said at a White House meeting with conservative advocacy groups. Supreme Court nominations require Senate confirmation.  If confirmed, Gorsuch would reinstate the Supreme Courtâ€™s conservative majority, in place for decades until Justice Antonin Scaliaâ€™s death last Feb. 13. The courtâ€™s ideological shift could prove pivotal on a range of issues including presidential powers, abortion, the death penalty and transgender, gun and religious rights. Trumpâ€™s comments came as Democrats plotted strategy on how to deal with Gorsuchâ€™s nomination. They remain furious over McConnellâ€™s refusal last year to let the Senate hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s nomination of Merrick Garland to succeed Scalia on the court.  Some Democratic senators, arguing that Republicans stole a Supreme Court seat from Obama, announced their opposition to Gorsuch, while others said they were willing to hear him out. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor that if Gorsuch could not meet the same standard Republicans insisted on for Obamaâ€™s Supreme Court nominees, at least 60 votes for confirmation, â€œthen the problem lies not with the Senate, but with the nominee.â€ â€œThe answer should not be to change the rules of the Senate, but to change the nominee to someone who can earn 60 votes. Sixty votes produces a mainstream candidate,â€ Schumer added. To get those 60 votes, Republicans hope to lure eight Democrats up for re-election in 2018 in Republican-leaning states or states that voted for Trump last November. Those include Democrats from Indiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, Missouri, Michigan, Montana and Wisconsin as well as closely divided Maine. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Republican-leaning Ohio, already announced he would vote against Gorsuch. Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin said she would review Gorsuchâ€™s record but was â€œdeeply troubledâ€ over his stances against disabled students, workers and womenâ€™s reproductive healthcare. Senator Jon Tester of Montana said in an interview he wanted to review Gorscuchâ€™s record on womenâ€™s rights and other issues, adding the judgeâ€™s stance on end-of-life issues â€œdistresses me.â€ Gorsuch is known for siding with the Christian owners of a company that challenged federal requirements that businesses provide insurance coverage for womenâ€™s birth control and for writing against euthanasia and assisted suicide. The influential, deep-pocketed Americans for Prosperity is promising a vigorous effort to help Gorsuch get confirmed and is using its network of wealthy contributors to build support, especially in battleground states. The organization is led by multi-billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. It has been ramping up its political campaign donations in support of Republican candidates for the Senate and other offices.     Schumer said that while Trump campaigned as someone who would â€œbe for the working man and woman,â€ he now had chosen a Supreme Court nominee who â€œsides with CEOs over citizens.â€ â€œUnfortunately, Judge Gorsuch has proven to have a judicial philosophy outside of the mainstream and time and again has subjugated individual rights to those of corporations,â€ said Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who came out in opposition to the nomination.  Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who met with the nominee on Wednesday, said a Supreme Court nominee should have to win the support of 60 senators but urged fellow Democrats to give Gorsuch a chance. Manchin, whose home state, West Virginia, voted overwhelmingly for Trump, is up for re-election in 2018. Senate aides said Republicans were hoping the Judiciary Committee could hold hearings and a vote on the nomination by late March, paving the way for confirmation by the full Senate in the first week of April. If that happens, Gorsuch could be on the high court in time to year a major transgender rights case.", "output": "1. True"}

Some said the heavily armed Kenyan troops were overly zealous in rooting out Al Shabaab terrorists who have claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n\"It's not safe here for us as residents,\" said Abdikadir Adolwa. \"The soldiers are whipping residents to force them to identify terrorists. The military have terrorized this area and we fear going to the streets of the town.\"\n\nMany residents who could stay outside the town opted to leave while the troops were present.\n\n\"They're arresting people who have no national identity cards,\" said Nathar Abdkir Balza, a mother of five, who owns a hotel in Garissa. \"You can be arrested for loitering.\"\n\nEthnic Somalis especially have deserted the area. Al Shabaab hails from nearby Somalia.\n\n\"The Somalis like miraa but they are now afraid to come to town and buy it,\" said Kevin Kariuki, who sells miraa, or khat, an African plant that has slightly intoxicating effects when chewed.\n\nEarlier Friday, the Kenyan government appealed for help in capturing nine men, described as \"bloodthirsty, armed and dangerous,\" in the wake of an attack on Garissa University that left 148 people dead.\n\nAttackers from the Somali-based terror group al-Shabab told university students before they were killed that \"this is the beginning of more attacks\" targeting schools and universities in the country, the Kenya-based Standard reported.\n\nThe four gunmen were killed Thursday as security forces moved to end the 15-hour siege, which appeared to target Christians and Islamic converts. Two security guards, one policeman and one soldier were among the dead. At least 79 people were injured, and more than 500 students held hostage were rescued.\n\nInterior Minister Joseph Nkaissery updated the casualties figures Friday, saying the gunmen killed 148 people. He said 142 of the dead were students, three were policemen and three were soldiers. Nkaissery added that 104 people were wounded.\n\nSurvivor Claire Mumo, a student, was in the college when the terrorists attacked on Thursday.\n\n\"I was woken up by gunshot sounds inside our dormitory. The four gunmen I noticed ordered everybody to lie down before they started shooting at us,\" said Mumo. \"The blood of my friend spilled on my head when she was shot. The gunmen thought they had shot and killed me.\"\n\nThe gunmen left her alone because they thought she was already dead, she said. As she lay on the floor, she heard them carry out their plans.\n\n\"I heard them asking and separating Muslims and Christians students. Then shortly I heard sounds of gunshots,\" Mumo added. \"I only came out when I saw our security forces collecting bodies. I will never forget this attack. I'm lucky to be alive.\"\n\nSurvivor Helen Titus said one of the first things that the al-Shabab gunmen did when they entered the campus early Thursday was to head for a lecture hall where Christians were in prayer. Al-Shabab is a Somalia-based Islamic extremist group with ties to al-Qaida.\n\n\"They investigated our area. They knew everything,\" Titus told The Associated Press outside a hospital in Garissa where she was being treated for a bullet wound to the wrist.\n\nTitus, a 21-year-old English literature student, said she smeared blood from classmates on her face and hair and lay still at one point in hopes the gunmen would think she was dead.\n\nThe gunmen also told students hiding in dormitories to come out, assuring them that they would not be killed, said Titus, who wore a patient's gown as she sat on a bench in the hospital yard.\n\n\"We just wondered whether to come out or not,\" she said. Many students did, whereupon the gunmen started shooting men, saying they would not kill \"ladies,\" Titus said. But they also shot women and targeted Christians, said Titus, who is a Christian.\n\nEsther Wanjiru said she was awake at the time of the attack. Asked if she lost anyone, she said: \"My best friend.\"\n\nAnother survivor, Nina Kozel, said she was awakened by screaming and that many students escaped by sprinting to the fences and jumping over them. Some suffered bruises, she said. Many men were unable to escape, and hid in vain under beds and in closets in their rooms, according to Kozel.\n\n\"They were shot there and then,\" she said.\n\nThe mortuaries in Garissa, near the Somali border in northeastern Kenya, were so overwhelmed they had to ship many of the bodies to the capital of Nairobi, 200 miles away, the BBC reported.\n\nThe government began evacuating students who survived the Thursday terror attack, but many parents still don't know about their fate of their children.\n\n\"I phoned my daughter Susan since yesterday in the morning when I received bad news about the attack, but she didn't pick my calls,\" said Eunice Wangari, a mother of three. \"I don't know if she's still alive or not. The government is taking too long to identify the bodies. I am very stressed.\"\n\nJudith Musyoka, 45, and Boaz Musyoka, 55, are still searching for their son, Sammy Mutiso Musau in the wake of the attack that killed 147 students and staff.\n\n\"I don't know if my son is still alive,\" said Boaz. \"When I heard the news about terror attack I called him several times but his phone was not going through. I need to know his fate.\"\n\nA curfew was imposed for two weeks on Garissa and three neighboring counties. Cabinet Secretary of Education Jacob Kaimenyi ordered the university closed for an unspecified period, sending many students lugging suitcases onto buses Friday.\n\nThe Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) advised teachers in the region to leave immediately if they felt unsafe.\n\n\"We will not allow our teachers to risk their lives working in an insecure environment,\" said Willison Sosion, chairman of KNUT, who called for Garissa University to be closed permanently.\n\nSome Kenyans were angry that the government didn't take sufficient security precautions. The attack came six days after Britain advised \"against all but essential travel\" to parts of Kenya, including Garissa.\n\nA day before the attack, President Uhuru Kenyatta dismissed that warning as well as an Australian one pertaining to Nairobi and Mombasa, saying: \"Kenya is safe as any country in the world. The travel advisories being issued by our friends are not genuine.\"\n\nGarissa Gov. Nathif Jama Adam condemned the attack and demanded the government address security in the region to stop locals from leaving.\n\n\"I want to plead with Kenyans to stay here as we work with the government to boost security in our region,\" he said, in particular appealing to Christians in the region. \"We'll not allow terrorists to divide our people on religion lines.\"\n\nKenyan officials offered a $220,000 bounty for Mohammed Mohamud, who they suspect planned the attack. On social media, the Interior Ministry called him \"the mastermind.\"\n\nMohamud, who goes by other aliases, may have been assisted by two youths who conducted surveillance on the university, Kenya's The Star newspaper reported. He reportedly has claimed responsibility for a bus attack that left dozens dead late last year.\n\nNational chairperson of the National Muslim Council of Kenya, Nazlin Umar Fazaldin Rajput, criticized the government for failing to shore up security after Somali-based militants attacked civilians in retaliation for Kenyan military operations against their base in Somalia.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Negotiators have been hesitant to publicly share details, but there is obvious discord between Iranians and the U.S. on Iran's demand for sanctions relief. Iranians have long insisted that a final agreement, to be reached by June 30, should trigger an instant lifting of the broad sanctions imposed by the U.S., the European Union, and the United Nations. American negotiators have argued that sanctions relief must occur gradually, as Iran demonstrates compliance with terms of the nuclear agreement.\n\nBoth sides are facing tremendous pressure back home to avoid compromising. Sanctions have crippled Iranâ€™s economy, which is heavily dependent on oil exports. Perhaps more importantly, Iranians see the international sanctions as an injustice that should be reversed immediately as part of any comprehensive nuclear deal.\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is pushing for a veto-proof majority on a bill that would allow Congress to vote on the final deal and strip the president of authority to temporarily waive sanctions. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) became the most recent Democratic senator to lend his support, tentatively putting the Corker bill about four votes shy of the 67 needed to override a presidential veto.\n\nSens. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) have formidable support for a separate bill, which would impose new sanctions on Iran if negotiators fail to reach an agreement by the June 30 deadline. Sensing hesitance from Democrats, Menendez agreed to delay voting on the bill until after the March 31 deadline.\n\nObama has promised to veto both bills and has pleaded with lawmakers to hold off on legislation until the negotiations are complete. The president said either the Corker or the Kirk-Menendez bill would likely derail negotiations at this point. Failure to reach a political framework by Tuesday could prompt lawmakers to take action.\n\nSanctions are far from the only hurdle. Iran currently has 19,000 centrifuges, including 10,000 that are spinning to produce uranium. While leaked details of the talks indicate that the parties have agreed to Iran keeping about 6,000 centrifuges in operation, there is disagreement about how sophisticated the remaining centrifuges can be, and where they can produce uranium.\n\nOn Thursday, The Associated Press reported that Tehran may be able to continue running centrifuges at Fordow, a once-secret underground bunker that would likely be invulnerable to a military strike if it were to host illegal nuclear activity in the future.\n\nMenendez responded to the report with outrage. â€œWe have pivoted away from demanding the closure of Fordow when the negotiations began, to considering its conversion into a research facility, to now allowing hundreds of centrifuges to spin at this underground bunker site where centrifuges could be quickly repurposed for illicit nuclear enrichment purposes,â€ he said in a statement. â€œMy fear is that we are no longer guided by the principle that â€˜no deal is better than a bad deal,â€™ but instead we are negotiating â€˜any deal for a dealâ€™s sake.â€™â€\n\nThe rumored concession at Fordow would be in return for increased limitations on centrifuges and research and development work at other nuclear sites, according to the AP. Fordow would be subject to international inspections and the centrifuges there would operate on zinc, xenon, or geranium, rather than uranium, which can be enriched to fuel a nuclear weapon.\n\nRegardless of the number of centrifuges ultimately left in operation, Iranâ€™s stockpiles of uranium puts its breakout period -- the time needed to produce enough material for a nuclear weapon -- less than the one year baseline that the U.S. has insisted upon for any final agreement.\n\nAt one point, Tehran appeared willing to ship its stockpile of uranium to Russia, where it would be converted to fuel rods. In recent days, Iranian negotiator Abbas Araqchi balked at the idea of sending uranium abroad, as first reported in The New York Times. An alternative to exporting uranium may be to dilute it into lower-grade material that could not be used for weapons.\n\n \n\n Further complicating the goal of reaching a political framework is defining what that means. Because political and technical components of Iranâ€™s nuclear program often overlap, there has never been a publicly shared list of benchmarks for Tuesday's deadline. In fact, it's unclear whether the political framework should produce a signed document, or simply an understanding between the negotiating parties.\n\nâ€œThe March 31 deadline for reaching a framework agreement is a soft target,â€ Davenport explained in an email to The Huffington Post. â€œGiven that the expectation for the end of March is a broad framework outlining the major parameters of a deal, a signed document is extremely unlikely because there will still be technical annexes that both sides will want to see worked out.\n\nâ€œWhile failure to reach a framework agreement by the end of March will certainly result in a backlash from those that want to derail negotiations and kill the prospects for a deal, the real focus must remain on completing an entire agreement by June 30,â€ Davenport added.", "output": "1.

But his maelstrom of activity  â€”   the bold executive orders, the fiery Twitter posts, the brazen speeches  â€”   has also exposed, and perhaps exacerbated, ideological differences. For those devouring news about the administration, the choice of narratives has become starker, with brighter lines drawn around the content. For the readers and viewers, itâ€™s follow the narrative of your choice, and be wary of the great chasm between. Over the weekend, as protesters descended on airports across the country in response to Mr. Trumpâ€™s immigration ban, fissures began to emerge even among   news organizations. On Monday, the divide only widened. And not everyone behaved predictably. Bill Oâ€™Reilly, the outspoken Fox News host, expressed skepticism about the rollout of Mr. Trumpâ€™s plan and called it â€œa mistakeâ€ to rush it. While he did make some effort to defend Mr. Trump, he was also somewhat moderate in one segment. â€œIt is certainly responsible and logical for a new president to institute updated protections for this country by ordering specific temporary immigration actions,â€ Mr. Oâ€™Reilly said. â€œHowever, itâ€™s also responsible for a federal judge to order that foreigners with the proper credentials already issued not be punished. There should be room for    decision making. â€ He even invoked the Statue of Liberty to make his point. Some of Mr. Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s guests were also critical. Karl Rove said of Mr. Trump that â€œthe controversy is hurting him more than the controversy is helping him. â€ Brit Hume said it was handled â€œvery clumsily. â€ And Charles Krauthammer said it was introduced in the â€œmost amateurish, botched way. â€ But, in more typical form, Mr. Oâ€™Reilly also focused on what he said he perceived to be Mr. Trumpâ€™s political calculation, adding that much of the country was â€œgetting fed up with the   people. â€ By late Monday, order on Fox News had been fully restored. In his opening monologue, Sean Hannity followed a familiar trope, criticizing the mainstream news media for â€œfreaking out and completely misrepresentingâ€ the immigration ban. The Trump administration, he said, was trying to â€œset the record straight, but the media wonâ€™t listen. â€ The Wall Street Journal, part of the Rupert   News Corporation, delivered a scathing editorial on Monday denouncing Mr. Trumpâ€™s â€œblunderbussâ€ policy. But on Tuesday, some journalists at the publication were frustrated after a note from the editor in chief, Gerard Baker, instructed editors to avoid the phrase â€œseven majority Muslim countriesâ€ when writing about the order. â€œItâ€™s very loaded,â€ Mr. Baker wrote Monday night in the note, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times (and reported earlier by BuzzFeed). â€œThe reason theyâ€™ve been chosen is not because theyâ€™re majority Muslim but because theyâ€™re on the list of countries Obama identified as countries of concern. Would be less loaded to say â€˜seven countries the U. S. has designated as being states that pose significant or elevated risks of terrorism. â€™â€ The note caused concern among some editors and reporters in the newsroom as inappropriate interference. In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Journal said Mr. Bakerâ€™s note was â€œpart of a larger conversation discussing   developments as a story was being edited on deadline. â€ In the same email chain, she said, Mr. Baker also pushed to include more comments from critics of Mr. Trumpâ€™s policy. On Tuesday, Mr. Baker sent a memo to employees saying there was â€œno ban on the phrase â€˜  countryâ€™â€ but that the publication should â€œalways be careful that this term is not offered as the only description of the countries covered under the ban. â€ The unrest was only the latest manifestation of greater concern among a faction of reporters and editors at The Journal who are dissatisfied with what they view as sympathetic coverage of Mr. Trump. Mr. Baker has maintained that the publication is committed to fair reporting. Elsewhere in the news and entertainment empire of the Murdoch family, there was a more pointed response to Mr. Trumpâ€™s immigration policy. In a memo to employees of 21st Century Fox on Monday evening, James and Lachlan Murdoch suggested they did not fully support Mr. Trumpâ€™s executive order. â€œ21CF is a global company, proudly headquartered in the U. S. founded by  â€”   and comprising at all levels of the business  â€”   immigrants,â€ they wrote. â€œWe deeply value diversity and believe immigration is an essential part of Americaâ€™s strength. â€ Among   organizations, the tone in the last few days has been predictably defiant and jubilant, reflecting their position on the conservative spectrum. Several seized on Mr. Trumpâ€™s accusation that Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, had shed â€œfake tearsâ€ over the ban. The Federalist, a   web magazine, published an article under the headline, â€œNo, Trumpâ€™s Immigration Order Isnâ€™t Racist or Reminiscent of the Holocaust. â€ After Mr. Trump fired Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general, on Monday night for refusing to carry out his immigration order, Breitbart News went with the spirited headline, â€œYouâ€™re Fired: Trump Fires AG for â€˜Betrayal. â€™â€ The conservative Daily Caller called Ms. Yatesâ€™s decision a â€œbrazen act of defiance that cost her the post. â€ On Tuesday afternoon, Breitbart readers may have been surprised to see the site covering protests  â€”   but the blaring headline would have quickly showed the organizationâ€™s focus. â€œTrump Supporter Knocked Unconscious at Portland Airport Protest,â€ the site wrote.", "output": "1.

Ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that bans women from driving, despite ambitious government targets to increase their public role, especially in the workforce.

But there's no evidence the type of fraud he alleges is rampant.\n\nSupporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump wait for his arrival at a campaign rally at the University of North Carolina Wilmington on Aug. 9. The GOP presidential nominee claimed Clinton supporters could vote 15 times without a voter ID law.\n\nDonald Trump has been claiming, of late, that if he loses in November, it will be because the election was â€œrigged.â€ After all, he says, look at the big, enthusiastic crowds he attracts at his events.\n\nOf course, massive crowds do not necessarily foretell victory. Often they are more a sign of passion and devotion, or the entertainment value of a candidate, and donâ€™t guarantee success â€“ as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders saw in his losing battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nMr. Trump, it appears, is preparing the groundwork to lose, as his poll numbers in key electoral battlegrounds sink. In the meantime, heâ€™s calling on his supporters to register online as volunteer election observers, and in the process is also gathering voter contact information and asking for contributions. So in a way, the â€œrigged electionâ€ cries are just another avenue for voter engagement.\n\nBut more ominously, Trump threatens to delegitimize the outcome in November, if he loses and convinces his supporters that Hillary Clinton stole the election. That could undermine the very fabric of American democracy.\n\nâ€œSomething like this is unprecedented, as far as I know â€“ where a major presidential contender openly raises doubts about the legitimacy of an election before the vote, and without any evidence,â€ says Matthew Kerbel, political science chairman at Villanova University in Pennsylvania.\n\nWhatâ€™s more, it would be â€œextraordinarily difficultâ€ to rig a presidential election in the way Trump suggests, Professor Kerbel says. â€œYouâ€™re talking about rigging an election in the Electoral College, where you would have to rig a combination of states.\"\n\nPerhaps the biggest protection to US elections is their decentralized nature. The US Constitution and federal law give states broad leeway in how they run elections, resulting in a multitude of voting systems, even within states. So to rig the results of a national election at the ballot box or with absentee ballots, a vast conspiracy would be required.\n\nTrump has centered his allegations of planned cheating in a handful of key states. In Pennsylvania, he has bemoaned the fact that the commonwealth does not require a voter to present photo identification to cast a ballot.\n\nâ€œWe don't want to see people voting five times, folks,â€ Trump said last Friday in Altoona, Pa. â€œI donâ€™t even know, maybe you should go down and volunteer or do something. But without voter ID, there's no way you're going to be able to check it properly.â€\n\nEarlier in the week, in Wilmington, N.C., Trump suggested that Clinton supporters could now vote â€œ15 timesâ€ for her, given the federal appeals court ruling last month rejecting the stateâ€™s voter ID law. The law, which also ended same-day registration and shortened the stateâ€™s early-voting period, had a racially â€œdiscriminatory intent,â€ the ruling said.\n\nTrump has also raised the prospect of voter fraud in Ohio, another critical battleground state.\n\nBut the kind of cheating Trump envisions on a mass scale is virtually impossible to pull off â€“ including in states that donâ€™t require the showing of a photo ID. Even in such states, to vote 10 or 15 times, one would have to go to 10 or 15 different polling places and provide the names and addresses of people who live in those precincts and had not yet voted.\n\nThe call for â€œTrump Election Observersâ€ creates the appearance that in-person voter fraud is common. But election experts call the rate of such fraud vanishingly small. In 2014, an investigation by Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, found only 31 credible incidents of voter impersonation out of 1 billion votes cast in the US between 2000 and 2014.\n\nTo put that number in perspective, someone is more than three times more likely to win the jackpot in Pennsylvania's Cash 5 lottery as they are to have impersonated another voter.\n\nWhatâ€™s more, Professor Levitt points out, people in states with voter ID laws did not have greater confidence in the integrity of their elections than voters in states without such laws.\n\nâ€œThe factor that really influences whether people think the elections are fair? Whether their preferred candidates win,â€ Levitt writes.\n\nAnother issue for the Trump campaign is the matter of a 1982 court order that limits the Republican National Committeeâ€™s ability to challenge the eligibility of voters at polling places. The order bars the RNC â€œand its agentsâ€ from engaging in voter intimidation, especially in areas with large minority populations. The Trump campaign could plausibly be judged â€œan agentâ€ of the RNC, says election law expert Rick Hasen of the University of California at Irvine, and thus the Trump observersâ€™ activities could risk violating the order. And that, he says, could extend the order beyond its Dec. 1, 2017, expiration.\n\nTrumpâ€™s warnings of a rigged election could have another offshoot: suppressing his own vote.Â One recent poll shows a decline in the likelihood that Trump supporters will turn out, a trend that election data guru Nate Silver suggests may beÂ linked to Trumpâ€™s message about fraud.\n\nIn addition, a recent experiment by two academics suggested that the message of a â€œrigged electionâ€ was less effective at mobilizing voters than a more positive message, â€œregistering is quick, easy, and free.â€\n\nTrump voters already appear primed to believe that if he loses in November, it will be because the election was rigged. A Bloomberg poll released last week found that 34 percent of all voters, and 56 percent of Trump voters, believe the election results will be rigged.\n\nIn a poll of North Carolina voters last week by the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling, fully 69 percent of Trump supporters said they believed that if Clinton wins the election, it will be because the election was rigged.\n\nOf course, American history is replete with examples of election hanky-panky over the years, including ballots being cast by dead people.\n\nThe contested presidential election of 2000, which boiled down to a 537-vote margin in Florida and ultimately a ruling by the Supreme Court, remains a hotly debated episode. In 2004, some Democrats were convinced that their nominee, John Kerry, was the victim of voter fraud in Ohio â€“ a state that, had he won, would have handed him the election.\n\nWhatâ€™s different now is that Trumpâ€™s charges are being leveled well before Election Day. And heâ€™s not even focused on what could pose a real threat to the integrity of American elections: hackers.\n\nâ€œThereâ€™s vital interest in our election process,â€ Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said at a Monitor breakfast Aug. 3. \"Weâ€™re actively thinking about the election and cybersecurity right now.\"\n\nIn a phone call Monday, Secretary Johnson offered federal assistance to state officials in managing the risk to voting systems.\n\nFor Trump, the claim that fraud could swing the election is losing its salience, as his poll numbers head south. Irregularities matter only in a close election, and as of now, itâ€™s not looking close. But no one is calling the election over, and the â€œrigged electionâ€ argument isn't going away.", "output": "1. True"}

Europe is not amused. â–  The â€œBowling Green massacreâ€ that Kellyanne Conway lamented never happened, but it has triggered another   battle. â–  The presidentâ€™s phone manners apparently have not changed. This time he used them on Uberâ€™s chief executive. A soldier shot and wounded a man wielding a machete near the Louvre museum in Paris, prompting French authorities to open a terrorism investigation. The president of the United States responded: It is difficult to divine Mr. Trumpâ€™s thinking at times, but safe to say â€œget smartâ€ in this case most likely means accepting his policies. For their part, Europeans arenâ€™t taking well to the new American president. President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France, in a defense of the European Union that Mr. Trump has disparaged, said on Friday that European countries that wanted to forge bilateral ties with the United States had to â€œunderstand that there is no future with Trump if it is not defined in common. â€ Then there are the Germans: When Kellyanne Conway, the White House senior adviser, cited the â€œBowling Green massacreâ€ to justify President Trumpâ€™s halt to visas from seven predominantly Muslim countries, America was left scratching its collective head. And social media lit up with delight over the â€œmassacreâ€ that time forgot. This has not sat well with Ms. Conway, who after all did have a small kernel of truth to back her up, though no killings happened in Bowling Green, Ky. and a â€œmassacreâ€ does not appear to have ever occurred anywhere. In 2013, the State Department imposed a   freeze on processing Iraqi refugees after two Qaeda members were discovered in Iraq setting roadside bombs targeting American troops. They had been admitted to the United States in 2009 and lived in Bowling Green before they returned to Iraq. The fingerprint that nailed them was on a cellphone detonator tied to a bomb that had not exploded. So â€œmassacreâ€? No. In Bowling Green? No. Refugees? Well, yes, sort of. Ms. Conway now says she misspoke. But things got really hot when a Clinton jumped into the fray  â€”   Chelsea Clinton. Which only stoked old campaign feuds, and a reminder of the exaggerated claim from Hillary Clinton that, as first lady, she once landed in   Bosnia under fire from hostile Serbs. It never ends. President Trump has taken some heat for his phone manners since it emerged that he pretty much chewed out Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia before hanging up on him. Apparently Mr. Trump is unrepentant. According to the new online newsletter Axios, Mr. Trump had an unpleasant conversation with the chief executive of Uber, Travis Kalanick, after the brash entrepreneur quit  the presidentâ€™s business council in protest of his executive order banning some foreigners from entering the country. Some in Mr. Trumpâ€™s â€œinner circleâ€ suggested that Mr. Kalanick was cutting off his access to the White House. Mr. Kalanick might be a little more concerned with all the smartphone usersâ€™ dropping their Uber app in favor of Lyft, a competitor that was first to protest Mr. Trumpâ€™s immigration policies. In an unusual early morning session, the Senate on Friday cleared an important procedural hurdle to approving Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trumpâ€™s nominee for education secretary, setting up a final,   confirmation vote next week. The Senateâ€™s    vote along party lines to limit further debate on her nomination is deceptive. Two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, went along with the procedural vote, but they say they will oppose her on the final vote, expected on Tuesday. Callers have overwhelmed the Capitolâ€™s phone system, many of them expressing angry opposition to Ms. DeVosâ€™s nomination. Senators have heard from all manner of educators in their home states opposing her confirmation  â€”   and not just teachersâ€™ unions. The opposition from Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski raises the prospects of a    tie that Vice President Mike Pence, as president of the Senate, would have to settle. After convening at 6:30 a. m. one of the earliest starts in recent memory, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, urged his colleagues to take stock of their positions on Ms. DeVosâ€™s nomination over the weekend. â€Sometimes loyalty to a president demands a bit too much,â€ he said on the floor. Why so early? Under Senate rules, a set amount of time had to elapse between the first procedural actions, which took place Wednesday afternoon, and Fridayâ€™s vote. Remember Russia? The country that intelligence officials believe interfered in the 2016 presidential election on Mr. Trumpâ€™s behalf? Two weeks into Mr. Trumpâ€™s presidency, talk of the foreign powerâ€™s apparent role has somewhat faded from view, at least temporarily, in the daily avalanche of White House exploits and misadventures. But Capitol Hill will have its say. Two senators are convening an investigation into Russiaâ€™s election interference, joining other efforts in Congress to examine what happened. Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said their investigation would focus on Russian interference both in the United Statesâ€™ election and in other elections around the world. (Mr. Graham is the chairman and Mr. Whitehouse is the ranking member of a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee that is focused on crime and terrorism.) â€œOur goal is simple,â€ the senators said in a joint statement. â€œTo the fullest extent possible we want to shine a light on Russian activities to undermine democracy. â€ There are already multiple Senate committee examinations into Russiaâ€™s role, as well as an inquiry by the House. Dr. Harold N. Bornstein has been President Trumpâ€™s personal doctor for more than 35 years. He prescribed Mr. Trump the   drug that keeps the presidential mane flowing, and declared him the healthiest man to hold the highest office in the land. But for now, Mr. Trump will keep the same White House doctor who cared for Barack Obama, Ronny Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy. The decision, first reported by the online medical journal Stat, raised the possibility that voters might actually get some reliable information on the health of their commander in chief. The meeting of   chief executives at the White House on Friday  â€”   people like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone  â€”   was supposed to prove the bona fides of the new,     . But Mr. Trumpâ€™s temporary ban on visas from seven predominantly Muslim countries has complicated the discussion considerably. Travis Kalanick, Uberâ€™s chief executive, told employees he was dropping off Mr. Trumpâ€™s economic advisory council in protest of his immigration policies, given the number of immigrant Uber drivers. Bob Iger of Disney is not attending. And Elon Musk let it be known on Twitter that he would object to the ban to the presidentâ€™s face.", "output": "1. True"}

The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the people of the majority Arab city and surrounding province would decide their own future  within the framework of a decentralized, federal, democratic Syria . In a declaration formally announcing Raqqa s liberation from Islamic State after four months of battles, the SDF pledged  to protect the frontiers of the province against all external threats , and to hand control to a civil council from the city. The U.S.-backed SDF, which is led by Kurdish militia fighters and also includes Arabs, captured the Syrian de-facto capital of Islamic State s self-proclaimed caliphate this week in a decisive defeat for the group that had ruled over millions of people from central Syria to northern Iraq. In Syria, the fight against Islamic State has taken place amid a wider, multi-sided civil war between the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Iran and Russia, and an array of rebel groups supported by other powers. Kurdish-led authorities in other parts of the north say they want a federal system that would allow regions to rule themselves without central control by the center. They have been moving ahead with plans set it up, despite discouragement from their U.S. allies and strong opposition from both Turkey and the Syrian government in Damascus.  Turkey views the rise of Kurdish power in Syria as a threat to its national security, viewing Kurdish groups in northern Syria as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK), which is fighting a three-decade insurgency in Turkey. Turkey said on Friday that a huge banner of jailed PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan unfurled in central Raqqa by the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces was proof that Washington had been working with terrorists. The Kurdish-led autonomy plans in Syria have advanced as diplomacy has failed to make any progress towards a political solution to the six-year-long war. Assad, who is fast regaining territory in Syria s most populous eastern regions with Iranian and Russian military support, has repeatedly said the state will recover all Syria. Asked about the SDF statement, Ali Haidar, the Syrian government minister responsible for national reconciliation, said Raqqa s future could only be discussed  as part of the final political structure of the Syrian state . The SDF, dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia, has established control over swathes of northern Syria in operations backed by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, mostly avoiding conflict with Russian-backed pro-government forces. Spokesman Talal Silo reaffirmed the SDF s plan to hand control of Raqqa to a civil council formed of people from the city, and to hand over internal security to a police force drawn from local recruits. He called Raqqa s liberation  the final chapter  of a struggle that began against Islamic State from the town of Kobani some three years ago, though the SDF is still fighting the jihadist group in Deir al-Zor province. The United States has said it will take the lead in helping to clear rubble and restore basic services to the city. With Islamic State s self-declared  caliphate  crumbling in its last remaining Syrian strongholds, Assad s Russian allies said on Thursday the fight with the jihadist group would soon be over. President Vladimir Putin expressed hope a new peace conference could be convened, though the Kremlin said on Friday it was too early to discuss the timing or venue for the proposed  congress of the peoples of Syria .", "output": "1.

The outspoken founder of Ohio-based Murray Energy Corp said he has asked Trump, who campaigned on a promise to help the coal industry, to speak out on behalf of the spending bill provision currently tied up in Congress. â€œI asked him and Vice President-elect Mike Pence to be involved verbally and in writing,â€ Murray told Reuters in an interview. Murray said he has not yet heard back. A Trump transition official did not respond to a request for comment. Murray Energy was among the biggest contributors to Trumpâ€™s bid for the presidency. Its $100,000 donation to the Trump Victory PAC was the PACâ€™s largest from a company, according to Trumpâ€™s fundraising committeeâ€™s latest filing. Murray also hosted fundraisers for the Republican candidate. On the campaign trail, Trump won over coal-producing states by promising to revive the sector, put laid-off miners back to work, and scrap regulations that he said are hobbling the industry.  Coal prices have sunk in recent years due to competition from cheap natural gas and rules to combat climate change ushered in by President Barack Obama. The Senate is now contemplating a spending bill that contains a provision to extend the benefits of retired coal miners whose companies have gone bankrupt until next April, but some coal state Democratic senators are agitating for a longer-term solution and threatening a government shutdown. A group of Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, are resisting, and the bill is in limbo.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that the Obama administration hopes â€œthere should be bipartisan common ground to address the needs of these 20,000 coal miners who are slated to lose their health insurance at the end of the month.â€  Dozens of United Mine Worker retired miners have been on Capitol Hill this week holding rallies and visiting lawmakers to urge them to pass a longer-term solution. UMWA spokesman Phil Smith said the Trump transition team is aware of the issue but has not said anything publicly. As one of just a handful of U.S. coal companies that has not declared bankruptcy, Murray said his company is struggling to pay into its health and pension funds and â€œcanâ€™t compete with those companies that didnâ€™t go through bankruptcy proceedings.â€", "output": "1.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: â€œIf you were to look at our game board of all the possible outcomes of the election, this one wasnâ€™t even on the sheet. â€ That was how Mark T. Bertolini, chief executive of the large health insurer Aetna, described the election of Donald J. Trump as the next president. He was speaking with me last Thursday on stage at The New York Timesâ€™s annual conference, DealBook: Playing for the Long Term. â€œWe started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday. We had no idea how to approach it,â€ Mr. Bertolini said. Business executives across the nation and the world have been whipping out fresh pieces of paper to map how Mr. Trumpâ€™s election and Republican control of the White House, Senate and House  â€”   which may make Washingtonâ€™s notorious gridlock a memory  â€”   will reshape economic policy. The stock market has jumped, taking many prognosticators by surprise, in anticipation of the seismic changes Mr. Trump has promised: a repeal or refashioning of the Affordable Care Act, a dismantling of the   regulations for Wall Street, a substantial haircut for corporate and personal income tax rates, and a major infrastructure spending program, among other things. While the new conventional wisdom may be that the nation is about to see comprehensive change, the truth is that it is likely to be more incremental than across the board. Take, for instance, the   Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. While you would think much of the finance industry would salivate at the chance to rid itself of the law, its view is more nuanced. Most companies have made large investments and changes in their business practices to comply with the law. So itâ€™s hard to see how even the lawâ€™s   opponents in the industry would press for the full repeal that Mr. Trump said he would pursue. â€œThat omelet has been made that toothpaste is out of the tube,â€ Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said at the conference. â€œI wouldnâ€™t want regulation to be repealed in toto,â€ he added. â€œIf you want to be good for bankers, you have to have policies that would be good for economic growth. â€ More likely than a repeal, Mr. Trumpâ€™s administration will try to eliminate the components he has criticized most. A Trump administration could try to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog agency created by   which Republicans loathe, for example. â€œThe C. F. P. B. probably wonâ€™t be eliminated,â€ Ian Katz, a research analyst at Capital Alpha Partners in Washington, wrote in a note to clients. â€œIt would be horrible politics and optics to get rid of an agency that was established to protect the little guy. â€ Mr. Katz predicted that the Trump administration would be able to push through a switch that critics of the agency have long lobbied for: a shift in control of the consumer bureau from a single director to a bipartisan commission. Mr. Trump might also focus on changing a rule for small banks that grow to more than $10 billion in assets. Currently, such growth catapults a bank into a new regulatory category, one that comes with much stricter scrutiny and more elaborate reporting requirements. This rule has been criticized by the banking industry as an impediment to growth and competition. As for the return of    â€”   something Mr. Trump has talked about  â€”   donâ€™t bet on it. â€œThe Republican Partyâ€™s call for a return to a division of commercial and investment banking shouldnâ€™t be taken seriously,â€ Mr. Katz wrote. â€œThat was part of a campaign document. Big banks are useful as a populist scapegoat, and Trump may continue to use them in that way. But neither he or his top aides are interested in   2. 0. â€ Piecemeal change may also be true of Mr. Trumpâ€™s pledge to undo Obamacare, which was one of his bedrock campaign promises. Mr. Bertolini of Aetna predicted: â€œThere will be a repeal first, and I think the repeal will be at a minimum in name. â€ Itâ€™s nearly impossible for the law to be replaced with the flip of a switch. â€œBecause whatâ€™s going to happen in the next year?â€ he said. â€œWe have people signed up we have to honor that through 2017. Weâ€™ll have to work quickly to have something for 2018. â€ Mr. Bertolini said that whatever replacement plan might materialize, the government was not going to just stop insuring the 20 million or so people who are covered under the Affordable Care Act. â€œYou canâ€™t put them out on the street without insurance,â€ he said. His expectation is that Medicare Advantage will be expanded. The backpedaling on the â€œrepealâ€ pledge has already begun: Mr. Trump has said in the past several days that he intends to make sure that health insurers will not be able to turn away people with   conditions, and that people under the age of 26 will still be able to have coverage under their parentsâ€™ plans. About the latter provision, Mr. Trump said he would â€œvery much try and keep that. â€ In an interview with Lesley Stahl of â€œ60 Minutesâ€ that aired Sunday night, the   said that the measure â€œadds cost, but itâ€™s very much something weâ€™re going to try and keep. â€ Of course, the biggest question is how Mr. Trump is going to create a new manufacturing class in America. He has suggested that he is going to renegotiate trade agreements, increase tariffs on goods and deport illegal immigrants  â€”   both for security reasons, he contends, and because they take jobs from Americans. How those ambitions ultimately play out is anyoneâ€™s guess. One issue that Mr. Trump has seemingly avoided is that of how new technologies are steadily taking American jobs. â€œThe jobs that are routine are going to be replaced by technology,â€ Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said at the conference. Thatâ€™s a truth that may be at odds with Mr. Trumpâ€™s ambitions. Still, Mr. Schmidt had an optimistic outlook about how technology already provides unappreciated benefits. â€œManufacturing jobs are infinitely safer today because robots do the dangerous work,â€ he said. â€œWe take that for granted. â€ Despite all of the   among C. E. O.s surprised about the outcome of the election, there was a sense of optimism  â€”   or at least a sense of hope  â€”   that pervaded their words. â€œWe all know a lot about Trump the campaigner  â€”   now we have to find out about the Trump who needs to get things done,â€ Mr. Blankfein said. â€œHe will start to think not about getting elected but about what his legacy is going to be,â€ he continued. â€œI assume you go into that office and you think about your place in history and things change. â€ Mr. Blankfein added, â€œIâ€™m going to see how it goes before I become mournful. â€", "output": "1.

[Anthony Pomplianoâ€™s complaint claims that he only ran Snapchatâ€™s â€œgrowth and engagement teamâ€ for 3 weeks before he was terminated. His lawyer, according to the Los Angeles Times, said: â€œMr. Pompliano was terminated because he refused to participate in a scheme to deceive the public and artificially inflate Snapchatâ€™s valuation in anticipation of itsâ€ initial public stock offering. â€  The accusations appear to allege that Snap, Inc. was seeking to violate the United States Securities Act of 1933, referred to as the â€œtruth in securitiesâ€ law. The law has the dual objectives of requiring that investors receive financial and other significant information concerning securities being offered for public sale and prohibiting deceit, misrepresentations, and other fraud in the sale of securities. Snap, Inc. spokeswoman Mary Ritti said in a statement that the complaint is without merit: â€œIt is totally made up by a disgruntled former employee. â€ Breitbart News reported in late December that with â€œ2016 being the worst year for initial public offerings (IPOs) since the   financial crisis,â€ Silicon Valley was hoping Snap, Inc. as the company behind the popular chat appâ€™s $25 billion â€œunicornâ€ private market valuation, would renew excitement for tech deals by raising $5 billion in a January. New IPOs raised a $19 billion in 2012, and the number of deals peaked at 32 in 2014. But 2016 saw only $1. 2 billion raised on 11 deals  â€”   fewer than half as many deals as last year and only 70 percent of the cash raised. But Snapchat is now the third most popular social app among   year old millennials, and is expected soon to take the number 2 spot from Instagram. More importantly, its penetration is even more powerful among the   year old   demographic. About 70 percent of college students report posting on Snapchat at least once a day, compared to 11 percent reporting that they post on Facebook with the same frequency. Backed by a stable of top tech venture capital firms that include Benchmark Capital, General Catalyst Partners, and Lightspeed Venture Partners the IPO had Wall Street whispering that huge investor demand for Snap shares could motivate some of the other 182 private unicorns to go public and launch Silicon Valley toward a very lucrative year. Pomplianoâ€™s complaint for damages claims that â€œSnapchat will not let anything stand in its way of an IPO, including obligations to represent material facts accurately. â€ But a third of the suitâ€™s 21 pages filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court are blacked out by Pomplianoâ€™s attorney, David Michaels. He indicated to the Times that the â€œredactions protect information possibly subject to a confidentiality agreement between his client and Snap. â€ Snap has 10 days to file a motion to maintain the redactions.   snippets from the lawsuit indicate that there are two performance metrics that the company knew were fraudulent, but still used during the recruitment process to induce Pompliano to jump from Facebook to Snap. Pompliano specifically alleges that because its chief executive, Evan Spiegel, â€œdid not careâ€ for numbers, Snap lacks sophisticated methods of verifying user statistics. Pompliano alleges that because his the â€œtruthâ€ concerning his termination would be so â€œpotentially damaging to Snapchatâ€™s planned IPO, terminating him wasnâ€™t enough to ensure that the public was kept in the dark. Accordingly,   Snapchat sought to destroy his career and reputation by waging a smear campaign. â€ The suit implies that Snap is still providing similar false and misleading data points to its venture capital investors.", "output": "1.

Gorsuchâ€™s confirmation will not do much to change the dynamics of the Supreme Court. His appointment is a    swap, a conservative replacing another conservative. But there is a more instructive way to think about what Judge Gorsuchâ€™s impact will be after he is sworn in on Monday. It is to consider how the court would have been reshaped by President Barack Obamaâ€™s pick for the same seat, Judge Merrick B. Garland. The answer shows just how polarized the Supreme Court has become. The titanic struggle over who would replace Justice Antonin Scalia was nothing if not partisan, and for good reason  â€”   the Supreme Court is just as divided as the rest of the nation. Had Judge Garland replaced Justice Scalia, the court would have immediately shifted to the left. A majority of its members would have been Democratic appointees for the first time in almost 50 years. And, in a shift in recent years, partisan affiliation has become a very strong predictor of voting trends for all its members. All four of the courtâ€™s current Republican appointees are more conservative than all four of the Democratic ones, and that familiar dynamic seems very likely to hold when Judge Gorsuch joins the court. But it has not always been thus. As recently as 2009, two Republican appointees to the court, Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter, were members of the courtâ€™s liberal wing. In losing the 2016 presidential election, Democrats may have given up the chance to change the balance of power on the Supreme Court for a generation. Judge Gorsuch is 49. If he serves as long as Justice Stevens, the last member of the court to retire, he will still be hearing cases in 2052. He would be 84, as old as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is now. Actuarial realities suggest that President Trump will have additional chances to move the court to the right. The courtâ€™s three oldest members are Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, 80, a moderate conservative who holds the decisive vote in many closely divided cases, and the courtâ€™s two senior liberals, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, 78, and Justice Ginsburg. Were Mr. Trump to replace any of the three, a court that generally leans right would have a   conservative majority. Were Mr. Trump to replace all three, the courtâ€™s remaining liberals  â€”   Justices Sonia Sotomayor, 62, and Elena Kagan, 56  â€”   could find themselves writing lonely dissents for years to come. Until the Democratsâ€™ surprise loss on Election Day in November, liberals had been anticipating something entirely different. â€œA Garland appointment would have swapped a centrist justice for a conservative one,â€ said Pamela S. Karlan, a law professor at Stanford University. â€œThis means Garland would have been more likely to be a key vote on more issues than Gorsuch is likely to be, because Kennedy remains the critical vote for a   conservative bloc, while Kennedy or Garland could have been the fifth vote for a liberal result. â€ Not only would Justice Kennedy have been ousted from his central role, but Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would have been thrust into the ideological minority. That would have put the Roberts courtâ€™s least popular precedent in immediate peril, said Jamal Greene, a law professor at Columbia. â€œThe biggest substantive change would probably have been in the area of campaign finance,â€ he said. â€œCitizens United would almost immediately have been on the chopping block with a liberal majority. â€ That decision allowed corporations and unions to do what individuals had long been able to do: independently spend as much as they liked to support or oppose political candidates. â€œI can even imagine a court with Garland on it chipping away at the    rule that forbids limits on individual campaign expenditures,â€ Professor Greene said. A range of other liberal policy priorities could also have been preserved, even though Judge Garland is not especially liberal. â€œWith a Justice Garland,â€ said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, â€œthe right for women to choose an abortion and exercise equal citizenship would have been comfortably protected. The ability of agencies to safeguard clean air and water, civil rights and workplace safety would be less threatened. Gay men and lesbians would rest secure in their marriages and not feel vulnerable to discrimination based on who they love. â€ On the other hand, some said that Mr. Trump delivered on his campaign promise and found a nominee whose views reflected, among other things, his hostility to the administrative state, a position Judge Garland does not share. â€œGarland has a record of deferring to the government on pretty much everything, be it labor regulation or law enforcement, while Gorsuch is much more skeptical both of government action and of judicial deference to executive agencies,â€ said Ilya Shapiro, a fellow at the Cato Institute, the libertarian group. Judge Gorsuch is very likely to be precisely the sort of conservative Mr. Trump promised his supporters. â€œThe justices that Iâ€™m going to appoint will be â€ Mr. Trump said at the third presidential debate in October. â€œThey will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. â€ Liberal despair over the future of the Supreme Court is compounded by hostility to Mr. Trump. â€œA president with unprecedented ignorance of, and contempt for, fundamental constitutional values has gotten the opportunity to fill Justice Scaliaâ€™s seat with a nominee who is likely to have a   career of moving the court to the right,â€ Professor Karlan said. In some ways, Judge Gorsuchâ€™s impact in the short term will be modest. He will very likely vote much as Justice Scalia did. The court will thus be basically unchanged since 2006, when Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. â€™s appointment moved it to the right. Justice Kennedy will remain at the courtâ€™s center, generally leaning right but occasionally joining the courtâ€™s liberal bloc, as he did in important decisions on gay rights, abortion and affirmative action. Those decisions are probably secure for now, but a newly empowered conservative majority is likely to continue the signature projects of the Roberts court: deregulating campaign finance law, allowing states to limit voting, expanding gun rights and viewing   decisions by the government with skepticism. A threat to public unions, averted by a    deadlock after Justice Scaliaâ€™s death, is likely to  . Justice Breyerâ€™s campaign to do away with the death penalty will founder. Richard H. Pildes, a law professor at New York University, said the array of cases in which the actual Justice Gorsuch and the hypothetical Justice Garland might differ is vast, including on campaign finance, affirmative action, voting rights, religious freedom, class actions, and aspects of criminal and immigration law. But he cautioned in an email that the two judges should not be reduced to stereotypes. â€œNeither Gorsuch nor Garland has written opinions in most of these areas,â€ he wrote, â€œbut if you treat them as place holders for â€˜conservativeâ€™ or â€˜liberalâ€™ outcomes  â€”   which is too simplistic and unfair to both of them  â€”   these are where those fault lines have been in recent years. â€", "output": "1.

Not going to happen. Youâ€™re going to pay a very large border tax.â€ Trump said he would not wait for negotiations with Mexico to be completed before starting to build a wall along the two countriesâ€™ border. â€œI could wait about a year and a half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which will start immediately after we get into office; but I donâ€™t want to wait.â€ â€œWeâ€™re going to be submitting ... a plan.

In the announcement, Woolsey said he supports Trumpâ€™s plan to expand the U.S. military, which calls for ending Pentagon budget caps and spending billions of dollars for additional troops, ships and aircraft. â€œMr. Trumpâ€™s commitment to reversing the harmful defense budget cuts signed into law by the current administration, while acknowledging the need for debt reduction, is an essential step toward reinstating the United Statesâ€™ primacy in the conventional and digital battlespace,â€ Woolsey said. Woolsey, who served for two years as CIA chief under then-President Bill Clinton, also criticized the presence of classified information in emails stored on Democratic candidate Hillary Clintonâ€™s private server. In an appearance on CNN, however, he called Trumpâ€™s plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States â€œa bad decision.â€ He also has warned about the threats posed by climate change, something Trump has called a hoax that benefits China. Woolsey was an outspoken proponent of the Iraq invasion, suggesting that Saddam was hiding nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs from U.N. inspectors. He also promoted the erroneous allegation that the Iraqi dictator backed al Qaidaâ€™s Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. Shortly after former President George W. Bush took office in 2001, Woolsey visited Britain on a Defense Department trip in a fruitless hunt for evidence that Saddam masterminded the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center in New York. He made a second visit to Britain for the same purpose shortly after Sept. 11, and again came up empty. At the time of his second trip, Woolsey was a member of the Defense Policy Board, a panel of outside advisers to the Defense Department that advocated Saddamâ€™s overthrow even in the absence of any evidence of his complicity in 9/11. The following year, he arranged for the Defense Intelligence Agency to debrief an Iraqi defector who claimed that Iraq had mobile biological-warfare laboratories disguised as yogurt and milk trucks. The man was later determined to be a fabricator. In 2000, Woolsey briefly served as a corporate officer of a foundation that managed U.S. funding for the Iraqi National Congress, the exile group that produced a series of defectors who peddled false information to bolster the allegations that Saddam was hiding illicit weapons programs. No such weapons or facilities have ever been found.", "output": "1. True"}

Citing Trumpâ€™s victory as a tipping point that pushed her to run, the 35-year-old public defender is one of 49 Democrats vying for Republican-held seats in the stateâ€™s House of Delegates, up from 29 two years ago. The races will test whether Democrats can convert Virginiansâ€™ unfavorable opinion of the Republican president in polls into votes and start clawing back some of the almost 1,000 legislative seats lost nationwide under Democratic President Barack Obama. Foy, long frustrated by her state legislatureâ€™s attitude toward womenâ€™s rights, is seeking a suburban Washington seat in one of the 17 Republican-controlled districts that voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton last year. â€œTrump was just confirmation that weâ€™re regressing and not progressing,â€ Foy told Reuters. â€œEnough is enough. If itâ€™s not me (to run), then who? If itâ€™s not now, then when?â€ Republicans hold a 66-34 advantage in the lower house of the Virginia legislature. Stephen Farnsworth, a political analyst at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, expects Democrats will make significant gains, especially by focusing on suburban districts. But a takeover of the chamber would require a collapse of Trump supporters, he told Reuters. â€œA Democratic majority in the House of Delegates is going to require a tidal wave,â€ Farnsworth said. The national mood has made Virginia Democrats hopeful. Opposition to Trump has galvanized hundreds of thousands of Americans and fueled huge turnouts at street protests since the  New York real estate developerâ€™s January inauguration.  A poll by the Washington Post and George Mason Universityâ€™s Schar School out May 22 showed 59 percent of Virginia voters disapproved of Trumpâ€™s performance, compared with 36 percent who approved. â€œWeâ€™ve got two things going for us in this upcoming election, and thatâ€™s going to keep energy high,â€ said David Toscano,Â Democratic leader in the Virginia House. â€œVoting for somebody, and also voting against somebody.â€ Mark Walter, president of the national Republican State Leadership Committee, said his party was watching Virginia but that it was difficult to tell how voter feelings about Trump would affect the races.  In New Jersey, the only other state holding statewide elections this fall, Democrats already control both chambers. The Virginia Republican Party is unfazed by the surge of challengers. Republicans had $6.5 million for House races by the end of March, compared with the Democratsâ€™ $2.8 million, according to the most recent numbers from the state elections department. Â Â Â  â€œWeâ€™re doing what weâ€™ve always done,â€ Chairman John Whitbeck said in an interview with Reuters. â€œRaise a lot of money, knock on a lot of doors and win a lot of seats.â€ Â Â Â  Toscano, the House Democratic leader, said his partyâ€™s candidates would use congressional Republicansâ€™ efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Obamaâ€™s signature domestic legacy, as a campaign issue, as well as Trumpâ€™s brief hiring freeze for most federal workers. The party also will cite Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffeâ€™s legacy of adding thousands of new jobs and billions in capital investment as a selling point, Toscano said.  McAuliffe cannot run again due to term limits, but the edge fellow Democrats have in the race to replace him is expected to give the partyâ€™s House hopefuls a boost. Democrats consider the 2nd District, home to sprawling housing subdivisions, strip malls and the Quantico Marine base, one of the partyâ€™s best bets to pick up a seat. Â Â Â  Clinton won the district by 21 points in November, helping her win a state that was once reliably Republican in presidential elections. Foy and fellow Democrat Josh King will compete in the June 13 primary. The winner will face Republican Laquan Austion in November for the seat being vacated by the Republican incumbent, who is not seeking re-election. All three candidates say voters are more concerned about local issues, such as traffic jams, education and pollution from power plant coal ash, than Trump. â€œObviously, the Trump effect is in the air, but weâ€™re focusing the energy into what we can do locally,â€ said King, 36, a deputy sheriff who narrowly lost the 2015 election for the seat.", "output": "1.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: The Federal Railroad Administration began investigating safety problems at New Jersey Transit before a fatal train crash last week, a federal rail official confirmed on Saturday. Federal officials began an audit in June of New Jersey Transit, the nationâ€™s   commuter railroad, after noticing an increase in safety violations and a leadership vacuum at the top of the agency, said the official, who was briefed on the investigation but was not authorized to discuss it publicly. After completing the audit, the federal agency issued a series of violations to the railroad, the official said. During the busy morning commute on Thursday, a crowded New Jersey Transit train slammed into a wall at the Hoboken Terminal in New Jersey, killing a woman and injuring more than 100 people. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash. As part of the earlier railroad administration audit, dozens of inspectors visited New Jersey Transitâ€™s railroad operations in June, the official said. The federal agency often inspects railroads, but an audit is a more serious step that is not common. On Saturday, Eric Weiss, a spokesman for the safety board, said the agency would review the federal audit as part of the investigation into the crash. A spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit did not respond to a request for comment. Before the crash, the railroad administration had been considering other enforcement actions against New Jersey Transit, including a compliance agreement to require additional changes. Officials at the administration declined to comment on the audit on Saturday, citing the continuing investigation by the safety board. The railroad administration completed a similar review of   Railroad in New York after a derailment in 2013 killed four passengers and injured more than 70 people. The review found that the railroad had a poor safety culture that prioritized   performance over protecting riders and workers. On Saturday, federal investigators from the safety board were working to determine the cause of the Hoboken crash  â€”   the first fatal train crash on New Jersey Transit since 1996. The trainâ€™s engineer, Thomas Gallagher, was interviewed by investigators, officials said. They declined to provide details of the conversation. Investigators could not remove the train from the crash site, officials said on Saturday, because of concerns over asbestos and the structural integrity of the building part of the roof collapsed on to the train. Officials said they did not find any signal anomalies on the tracks leading to the terminal. Officials will examine the event recorder from the train to determine how fast it was traveling, and consider several possible factors, including the engineerâ€™s actions and the maintenance on the railroad. New Jersey Transit has recently faced a series of challenges, from funding shortfalls to the lack of a permanent executive director. Veronique Hakim resigned from the post last year to join the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York. A former Amtrak executive appointed to the job, William Crosbie, ultimately turned it down, leaving Dennis J. Martin as an interim director. Transit advocates have criticized the agency because its board has not met in months. New Jersey lawmakers were at a stalemate recently over how to finance the stateâ€™s transportation trust fund, which pays for New Jersey Transit projects, and roads and bridges. After halting most work on transportation projects this summer, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, announced a deal with Democratic legislative leaders on Friday to raise the gas tax by 23 cents per gallon to finance the fund. After the crash, Mr. Christie said it was too early to know what caused the train to travel at a high speed into the station or whether the crash could have been prevented by a technology known as positive train control, which can automatically slow or stop a train. New Jersey Transit has not installed the technology, the Federal Railroad Administration said. New Jersey Transit agreed in June to pay $70, 000 in penalties for 10 safety violations found by the administration, according to its 2015 enforcement report. Two of those fines were for violations of passenger equipment safety regulations, the report shows. Reports covering the last three years show that New Jersey Transit agreed, from 2013 through 2015, to pay nearly $335, 000 in penalties for 33 violations of federal safety regulations found by the railroad administration. Ten of those fines were for violations of passenger equipment safety regulations, the reports show. Stephen Burkert, a spokesman for a union that represents New Jersey Transit rail workers, welcomed the federal agencyâ€™s safety review. At the Hoboken Terminal on Saturday afternoon, crews prepared to clear the station of debris. The whirring of buzz saws and banging of tools filled the building as crews began to remove the rubble by hand, loading the pieces into small bulldozers. New Jersey Transit train service at the terminal has been halted since the crash. The agency has not said when it would return.", "output": "1. True"}

C.  â€”   Seeming to abdicate one of his last chances to save his own life, the convicted killer Dylann S. Roof stood on Wednesday before the jurors who will decide his fate and offered no apology, no explanation and no remorse for massacring nine black churchgoers during a Bible study session in June 2015. Instead, in a strikingly brief opening statement in the sentencing phase of his federal death penalty trial, Mr. Roof repeatedly assured the jury that he was not mentally ill  â€”   undercutting one of the few mitigating factors that could work in his favor  â€”   and left it at that. â€œOther than the fact that I trust people that I shouldnâ€™t and the fact that Iâ€™m probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone whoâ€™s ever existed, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with me psychologically,â€ Mr. Roof, who is representing himself, told the jury, which found him guilty last month of the killings at Charlestonâ€™s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Three minutes after walking to the lectern, Mr. Roof returned to the defense table, exhaling deeply. Any prospects for mercy by the jury had perhaps already been drained by the prosecutionâ€™s disclosure, in its opening statement, of a white supremacist manifesto written by Mr. Roof in the Charleston County jail sometime in the six weeks after his arrest. â€œI would like to make it crystal clear I do not regret what I did,â€ he wrote in his distinctive scrawl. â€œI am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed. â€ Mr. Roof, who was then 21, continued: â€œI do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country and I do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race. I have shed a tear of   for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place. I feel pity that I had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed. â€ As the government laid out its case for a death sentence, the prosecutor who read from the journal, Nathan S. Williams, an assistant United States attorney, told the jury of 10 women and two men that Mr. Roofâ€™s deadly rampage was a premeditated act that had devastated the families of his victims. â€œThe defendant didnâ€™t stop after shooting one person or two or four or five he killed nine people,â€ Mr. Williams said, a few moments before he declared, â€œThe death penalty is justified. â€ Later, aided by a slide show, he described each of the victims and their lives, setting the stage for several days of   testimony by family members and friends of the victims. Mr. Williams emphasized that Mr. Roof was capable of remorse and regret, reminding jurors that he had left his mother a note of apology, but only for the pain he knew his actions would cause his own family. The presentations were a startling beginning to the trialâ€™s sentencing phase, which is expected to run into next week in Federal District Court. On Dec. 15, after six days of testimony in which defense lawyers did not contest his guilt, the jury found Mr. Roof guilty of 33 counts, including hate crimes, obstruction of religion resulting in death, and firearms charges. Eighteen of those counts require the jury to decide whether to sentence Mr. Roof, now 22, to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. To impose a death sentence, jurors must unanimously find that aggravating factors like premeditation and the number and vulnerability of the victims outweigh any mitigating factors, like the absence of prior violent behavior and demonstrations of redemption and remorse. Mr. Roof is also facing a death penalty trial in state court. Although many people in the courtroom had already heard Mr. Roofâ€™s flat,   monotone during the guilt phase, when prosecutors played a video recording of his   confession to F. B. I. agents, his statement on Wednesday was his first to the jury. Mr. Roof chose to allow his   legal team to represent him during the guilt phase, but sidelined them during the penalty proceedings to prevent them from introducing any evidence regarding his family background or mental capacity. â€œThe point is that Iâ€™m not going to lie to you, not by myself or through somebody else,â€ Mr. Roof told the jury. As his paternal grandparents watched from the second row on the left side of the courtroom, several women on the right side, which is reserved for victimsâ€™ family members, left their seats, one of them muttering curses. Mr. Roof has said he does not plan to call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf, and he did not   any of the prosecutionâ€™s witnesses on Wednesday. His approach stands in sharp contrast to the strategy of Justice Department lawyers, who have said they may call more than 30 witnesses, including at least one survivor of the attack, family members of the victims and federal law enforcement officials. Prosecutors began Wednesday with the widow of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, the churchâ€™s slain pastor, and his two best friends. Jennifer Benjamin Pinckney, who was married to Mr. Pinckney for 15 years, narrated an affectionate and often lighthearted telling of their life together, illustrated by dozens of photographs of her husband  â€”   as a young saxophone player in a school band, attending the births of their two daughters, vacationing on Caribbean cruises and on a trip to Seattle. She described him as a   preacher who extended his ministry as â€œa voice for the voicelessâ€ to his work in the South Carolina Legislature, where he served first in the House and then the Senate. Often exhausted by his dual roles, he was depicted in several pictures as having fallen asleep in the back seat of the family car and on a couch while reading to his daughters. â€œHe was the person that I think every mom would be happy that her daughter would marry,â€ Ms. Pinckney, a school librarian, said. â€œHe was that great catch. â€ Ms. Pinckney also described her terror on the night of June 17, 2015, as she and the coupleâ€™s younger daughter, Malana, then 6, listened to the gunfire from their hiding place beneath a desk in her husbandâ€™s study. As her husband and the others were gunned down in the adjacent church fellowship hall, Ms. Pinckney struggled to keep her daughter quiet and still. â€œI was just like, â€˜Shh, shh, shh,â€™ â€ Ms. Pinckney said, â€œand I put my hand over her mouth, and she was holding on to me, and she put her hand on my mouth. â€ â€œMama, is Daddy going to die?â€ her daughter asked, Ms. Pinckney said. She said the hardest thing she had ever done was telling her two daughters early the next morning that their father had been killed. Ms. Pinckney said she had heard Mr. Roof try to open the door to the study, which she had locked when the shooting began. Another assistant United States attorney, Julius N. Richardson, asked why she thought she had been spared. â€œIt wasnâ€™t my time,â€ Ms. Pinckney answered. â€œI couldnâ€™t see God taking both parents away from two small kids. â€ The Rev. Kylon Middleton, an A. M. E. minister who had known Mr. Pinckney from childhood, described his lifelong friend as immensely precocious (he began preaching at 13) and strategically ambitious (he aspired to be both a bishop and, perhaps, the stateâ€™s first   governor). In addition to Mr. Pinckney, the victims were the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor, 49 Cynthia Hurd, 54 Susie Jackson, 87 Ethel Lee Lance, 70 Tywanza Sanders, 26 the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr. 74 the Rev. Sharonda   45 and Myra Thompson, 59. Near the end of the day, Ms. Thompsonâ€™s widower, the Rev. Anthony B. Thompson, the vicar of a Reformed Episcopal Church here, told jurors about their   marriage, their anniversary date to a beach, his wifeâ€™s determined demeanor and her commitment to the historic congregation. In testimony that was mixed with laughter and tears, Mr. Thompson recounted their final day together as she prepared for the evening study of the Gospel of Mark. â€œShe had her glow,â€ he said. â€œI mean, this smile on her face. She was radiant. I just kept looking at her. â€ Word of a shooting came hours later, and Mr. Thompson rushed to the church. He demanded to know whether she had been injured or killed. He eventually found out. â€œMy whole world was gone,â€ he said. â€œI literally did not know what to do. Everything I did was for her, and she was gone. What am I here for? If sheâ€™s gone, what am I here for?â€", "output": "1. True"}

Many lawmakers have been pushing to renew the ISA quickly, to send a message to Tehran that Congress is still taking a hard line over its nuclear program, missile development and human rights record. The effort could set up another showdown over Iran between the administration and the Republicans who control Congress. Every Republican in Congress, and several of President Barack Obamaâ€™s fellow Democrats, opposed the agreement announced in July in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. House Republicans early this month passed legislation to restrict Obamaâ€™s ability to lift sanctions under the nuclear pact. The Senate has not taken it up and Obama has threatened a veto, and lawmakers are discussing alternatives. â€œIf the administration isnâ€™t supportive of this renewal (of the ISA), not only are we preventing the possibility of a snapback, but from the standpoint of myself and many of the members of this committee, weâ€™re also giving relief on missiles,â€ said Representative Ed Royce, the Republican committee chairman. Iran tested ballistic missile technology in October, prompting the United States to impose new sanctions in January, but many members of Congress want a stronger response. Kerry said lawmakers should allow more time to see how Iran responds to the international nuclear agreement, which went into effect only last month. He argued that sanctions can be imposed quickly if Iran is found to violate terms of the nuclear deal or other agreements. Kerry was asked about reports that Iran will enjoy a windfall of up to $150 billion from the nuclear agreement as money frozen under the sanctions regime is released. He said the total likely would be about one-third of that level, and currently is far lower. â€œOur estimates are itâ€™s somewhere in the vicinity of $50 to $55 billion at some point in time but itâ€™s way below that right now.â€ Kerry said. â€œAnd in fact, they are complaining about the slowness with which there has been a process of repatriation.â€", "output": "1.

Lebanon has been thrust to the center of regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran since the Saudi-allied Lebanese politician Saad al-Hariri quit as prime minister on Saturday, blaming Iran and Hezbollah in his resignation speech.    Saudi Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan said the Lebanese government would  be dealt with as a government declaring war on Saudi Arabia  because of what he described as aggression by Hezbollah. Faulting the Hariri-led administration for failing to take action against Hezbollah during a year in office, Sabhan said  there are those who will stop (Hezbollah) and make it return to the caves of South Lebanon , the heartland of the Shi ite community. In an interview with Al-Arabiya TV, he added:  Lebanese must all know these risks and work to fix matters before they reach the point of no return.  He did not spell out what action Saudi Arabia might take against Lebanon, a country with a weak and heavily indebted state that is still rebuilding from its 1975-90 civil war and where one-in-four people is a Syrian refugee. There was no immediate comment from the Lebanese government.  Hezbollah is both a military and a political organization that is represented in the Lebanese parliament and in the Hariri-led coalition government formed last year. Its powerful guerrilla army is widely seen as stronger than the Lebanese army, and has played a major role in the war in neighboring Syria, another theater of Saudi-Iranian rivalry where Hezbollah has fought in support of the government. Lebanese authorities said on Monday the country s financial institutions could cope with Hariri s resignation and the stability of the Lebanese pound was not at risk. But the cash price of Lebanon s U.S. dollar-denominated bonds fell, with longer-dated maturities suffering hefty losses as investors took a dim view of the medium- to longer-term outlook for Lebanon. Hariri cited a plot to assassinate him during his unexpected resignation speech broadcast from Saudi Arabia which caught even his aides off guard. He also slammed Hezbollah and Iran, accusing them of sowing strife in the Arab world. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has said he will not comment on Hariri s speech, calling it a  Saudi statement  and saying Riyadh had forced Hariri to resign. The sudden nature of Hariri s resignation generated speculation in Lebanon that his family s Saudi construction business had been caught up in an anti-corruption purge and he had been coerced into resigning.  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir said it was  nonsense  to suggest Hariri had been coerced into quitting in a CNN interview on Monday. Hariri had quit because Hezbollah had been  calling the shots  in the government, he said. Hariri, a Saudi citizen, was free to leave the country at any time, he said. Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk, a senior member of Hariri s political party, said he was under the impression Hariri would return to Beirut within days.  A meeting between Saudi King Salman and Hariri in Riyadh on Monday proved  rumors  wrong, he said", "output": "1. True"}

Revolutionary hymns evoked the bloody years, from 1937 to 1945, of what is known outside China as the Second   War. Chinese documentaries denounced Japanâ€™s â€œeight years of belligerence. â€ Now the war is getting a new name, and an extended time frame. In a move aimed at stirring up nationalism and support for the ruling Communist Party, President Xi Jinpingâ€™s government has ordered educators to rewrite textbooks to describe the conflict as the â€œ  War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression,â€ lasting from 1931 to 1945, the authorities said in a statement on Wednesday. Under the decision, the Second   War will be described as having started in the fall of 1931, when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Manchuria. Previously, the warâ€™s beginning had been traced to the Marco Polo Bridge incident, a skirmish in 1937 between Japanese forces and Chinese troops along a rail line southwest of Beijing that represented the beginning of   conflict. The Chinese Ministry of Education said the decision to add six years to the war sought to promote patriotic education and to highlight the Communist Partyâ€™s â€œcore roleâ€ in resisting Japanese fascism in the prelude to World War II. It also seemed intended to rally support for the party among young people as Mr. Xi vigorously promotes Communist history and thought in schools. Zhang Lifan, a historian in Beijing, said the decision to revise the length of the war was justified from a historical perspective. But he said it would also have political benefits for the party and would encourage   sentiment. â€œChinese leaders still have a Cold War mentality,â€ he said. â€œTheyâ€™ve tried to conjure up imaginary enemies in the world. â€ Mr. Xi has worked in recent years to enhance the image of the Communists and their achievements in World War II, even though many historians believe it was the Chinese Nationalists, not the Communists, who did most of the fighting. The party had not previously emphasized the fight against the Japanese from 1931 to 1937, when Communist forces were in disarray as they fought a civil war with the Nationalists. During that time, the Nationalists led efforts to resist the Japanese and negotiate truces. It was not until 1937 that the Communists joined forces with the Nationalists to fight an increasingly belligerent Imperial Japanese Army. Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at Kingâ€™s College London, called the textbook revision a â€œtidying up of history. â€ He said the revised account exaggerated the Communistsâ€™ accomplishments. â€œIt demonstrates this continuing keenness by the party now to seek sources of legitimacy wherever it can,â€ he said, â€œand reveals more insecurity than real strength. â€ The change will probably ruffle feathers in Japan, Chinaâ€™s longtime rival, as the countries jockey for influence in Asia and struggle to overcome the legacy of World War II, more than 70 years after the global conflict ended. Yasuhisa Kawamura, press secretary for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Thursday that it was not up to the Chinese government to decide the length of the war. â€œIt is important that Japan and China should demonstrate they do not focus excessively on the unfortunate past,â€ he added. Mr. Xi has accused Japan of distorting history, and the Chinese state news media has criticized Tokyoâ€™s efforts to revise textbooks, saying it has played down atrocities by Japanese soldiers. When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan visited Pearl Harbor last month, Chinese internet users brimmed with outrage, saying Mr. Abe had not done enough to apologize to China for Japanâ€™s actions during the war. In Beijing, many people applauded the governmentâ€™s decision to revise the textbooks, which are filled with references to wars against â€œaggressionâ€ by foreign forces. The Korean War, for example, is known as the war to resist United States aggression and aid Korea. â€œThe Japanese have also altered their textbooks, why canâ€™t we?â€ said Wang Yalin, 30, a musician. Still, he said, the change would most likely fuel   sentiment in China. Zhao Feng, 38, a tailor, acknowledged that the relationship between the countries had deteriorated. But he said it was important to note the earlier date of Japanâ€™s invasion of China. â€œThe occupation started much earlier,â€ he said. On social media, some people were more skeptical of the governmentâ€™s motives for making the change. â€œDonâ€™t use history education for political ends,â€ one person wrote on Weibo, Chinaâ€™s equivalent of Twitter. â€œThe most important thing is to learn the truth. â€", "output": "1.

His remarks came at a joint press conference with his Japanese counterpart, Taro Kono, after talks between the two men in Moscow, and prompted Kono to defend Japan s stance toward North Korea and its ties with the United States. Japan had wanted to focus on resolving a seven-decade old territorial dispute between the countries but Lavrov s comments on North Korea cast a shadow over the meeting.        We are expressing deep concern, with facts to back it up, that Japan along with South Korea is becoming a territory for the deployment of elements of the U.S. global missile defense system which is being rolled out in that region under the pretext of the North Korea threat,  Lavrov said.  We have no problems directly with Japan, we do not see risks there. We see risks because of the proliferation of a global U.S. missile defense system on the territory of countries that neighbor Russia, including Japan.  He said that in the past few weeks the United States had conducted military exercises in the region and adopted additional sanctions despite the absence of provocation from Pyongyang.  We are alarmed that in the last two months when North Korea conducted no tests or rocket launches, it seemed that Washington was not happy about that, and tried to do things that would irritate and provoke Pyongyang,  Lavrov said. Referring to U.S. officials, he said:  It s as if they are hoping that they (the North Koreans) will lash out again, and then it would be possible to engage in military options.   As you know, the U.S. leadership has said many times that all options are on the table, including military options, and we note that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, at a meeting with President Trump in early November, said that he supports the American position 100 percent,  Lavrov said. Japanese Foreign Minister Kono, after listening to Lavrov s remarks, responded that Japan and its allies were not seeking regime change in North Korea. He said Tokyo had to act to defend itself after Pyongyang test-fired missiles which flew over Japan s territory.  This is unprecedented, the most important and most pressing threat not just to Japan and Russia but to the international community as a whole. It s absolutely unacceptable,  Kono said, speaking through an interpreter.  We believe it s necessary to use all possible means and to increase the pressure on North Korea as much as possible to stop its nuclear program and the rocket launches,  he said.  Japan welcomes the position of the United States, which is that to protect Japan and South Korea, all means of deterrence will be used.  Earlier this year, Japan s Abe expressed hope of a breakthrough in Tokyo s dispute with Moscow over a group of islands in the Pacific, but that prospect has now dimmed. The islands are known in Japan as the northern territories and in Russia as the Kurile islands. At the end of World War Two, Soviet forces took control over the islands from Japan. The island dispute has meant that Moscow and Tokyo have still not signed a formal peace agreement to end war-time hostilities. Lavrov and Kono said at their talks that they had made progress on measures to boost Russian-Japanese economic cooperation on the islands, and to ease access for Japanese people wanting to visit. They offered no details about any progress on resolving the core of the dispute, about who has sovereignty over the islands.", "output": "1. True"}

Brown, a popular Democrat who has steered the nationâ€™s most populous state on a centrist path, praised Clintonâ€™s rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but noted that she had won about 3 million more votes and hundreds more delegates. â€œIn other words, Clintonâ€™s lead is insurmountable and Democrats have shown â€“ by millions of votes â€“ that they want her as their nominee.â€ California is the biggest prize of the six states that hold presidential nominating contests on June 7, with 475 delegates.

This Trump was part deal-maker, part salesman, asking for unity and trying to repackage his populist message in more palatable terms.  He was less combative, less thin-skinned and more inclusive.  And where five weeks ago at his inauguration, he slammed Washingtonâ€™s politicians as out-of-touch elitists who prospered at the expense of the public, his message on Tuesday night was different: I need you, Republicans and Democrats alike. Always a showman, the reality TV star-turned-politician laid out plenty of promises: A massive infrastructure and public works program; tax cuts for the middle class; immigration reform; a healthcare overhaul; an education bill. All of it would require congressional action, likely by different coalitions of conservatives, moderates and Democrats.  â€œThis is our vision. This is our mission,â€ Trump said. â€œBut we can only get there together.â€ Trump, a Republican who has taunted Democrats over his 2016 election victory and publicly fumed as they held up his Cabinet nominees, did not criticize them this time. Repeatedly, he asked for their help, arguing that the countryâ€™s problems call for bipartisan solutions.  After weeks of attacks on the media, political rivals and the judges who ruled against his executive order to temporarily ban travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, Trump finally eased off, although his proposals were short on specifics. â€œIt was a softer tone and he gave a speech and not a tweet and thatâ€™s more suitable when youâ€™re president of the United States,â€ said Democratic Representative Peter Welch. â€œThe challenges are going to be the details on his policies.â€ â€œHe was presidential tonight in a way he has not been before this,â€ said Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak. The address appeared to show some recognition by the White House that Trumpâ€™s bombastic go-it-alone style has its limits. After a parade of executive orders, Trump must now turn his attention to the big-ticket items on his agenda requiring legislative action.  â€œHeâ€™s done all he can unilaterally,â€ said Bradley Blakeman, a former aide to President George W. Bush. â€œNow he needs to pass bills.â€ Even though Republicans control Congress, Blakeman said Trump needs Democrats to build a majority that would allow conservative Republicans to oppose some of his more centrist proposals, such as hefty infrastructure spending and talks on immigration reform.  â€œThe president is as transactional a person as weâ€™ve ever seen,â€ Blakeman said. â€œHe understands that you might not like this deal, but I need you for three other deals.â€  Despite the softer tone, Trumpâ€™s divisive policies and months of hostile rhetoric will not be forgotten by his adversaries. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, in a round of television interviews on Wednesday morning, dismissed Trumpâ€™s speech as detached from reality, saying the softer tone did not match the administrationâ€™s hard-line agenda presented so far. â€œHis speeches are populist. Theyâ€™re aimed at the working folks who supported him. But his governing and what he does is hard right, favoring special interests over the working class,â€ Schumer told CBS. Nancy Pelosi, the leading Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, told MSNBC that Trump gave a good sales pitch but has offered little in the way of concrete proposals: â€œAll they have is rhetoric. We donâ€™t have any reality in terms of any legislation.â€ Congressional Democrats said they liked Trumpâ€™s infrastructure program, his childcare tax credit, his call to reduce the prices of prescription drugs, and his vow to preserve some key elements of former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature 2010 health insurance law. Democrats remain troubled, among other things, by Trumpâ€™s desire to slash domestic programs to increase military spending, his plans to reduce taxes for the wealthy and corporations, as well as his aggressive policy to deport illegal immigrants.   To be sure, the more foreboding elements of Trumpâ€™s campaign rhetoric were still present, albeit slightly dialed-down. As he did during the campaign, he portrayed a country in ruinous economic shape and plagued by terrorism, drugs, gangs, and illegal immigrants. In coming days, the White House is likely to release a revised version of its travel ban, reigniting a controversy that overshadowed the first weeks of Trumpâ€™s presidency. [nL2N1GE0SB] Trump came into the address struggling with public opinion. In an interview with Fox News he acknowledged that he and his staff had not been effective communicators. The most recent Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll found about 48 percent of Americans disapproved of Trumpâ€™s performance, with 46 percent backing him, poor numbers for a new president.  Mackowiak said Trumpâ€™s address could reverse his fortunes in a â€œcrucial momentâ€ for his presidency. â€œHis public support will improve from this speech,â€ he said.   But John Geer, a public-opinion expert at Vanderbilt University, was not convinced. â€œHeâ€™s going to have to do more than give a speech.â€", "output": "1. True"}

Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, addressed the Enquirer story at a news conference in Wisconsin, saying, â€œLet me be clear. This National Enquirer story is garbage. It is complete and utter lies. Itâ€™s tabloid smear and it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.â€ Trumpâ€™s statement pointed to other articles the Enquirer, a tabloid known for its gossip and unflattering celebrity photos, had been correct about in the past. â€œTed Cruzâ€™s problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone, and while they were right about O.J.

Former Colorado Senator Gary Hart, a Democrat, had his 1988 presidential campaign derailed when reports surfaced that he was having an affair. Former North Carolina Senator John Edwards admitted to having an affair with a campaign photographer during his 2004 campaign, although the public did not learn about the romance until after he was defeated.

[DHS Secretary John F. Kelly lifted most of the restrictions imposed on Border Patrol agents under the previous administration and ordered Border Patrol agents expand their efforts to enforce laws against illegal border crossings. The order came in a memo obtained by Breitbart Texas from DHS officials and discontinued President Obamaâ€™s â€œcatch and releaseâ€ program known as the â€œPriority Enforcement Programâ€ (PEP) enacted on November 20, 2014. The order leaves in place, President Obamaâ€™s deferred action programs for children brought to the U. S. illegally by their parents.  â€œExcept as specifically noted above, the Department no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,â€ Secretary Kelly wrote in the memorandum. â€œIn faithfully executing the immigration laws, Department personnel should take enforcement actions in accordance with applicable law. â€ To support the expanded enforcement actions, Kelly ordered the hiring of an additional 5, 000 Border Patrol agents and 500 U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO) officers. â€œCBP has insufficient   to effectively detect, track, and apprehend all aliens illegally entering the United States,â€ Kelly continued. â€œThe United States needs additional agents and officers to ensure complete operational control of the border. â€ Leaked Border Patrol training materials released in an article by Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby revealed the frustrating requirements placed on Border Patrol agents under the PEP program. â€œNothing says donâ€™t arrest, but it clearly says donâ€™t waste your time because the alien will not be put into detention, sent back or deported,â€ an official within U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told Darby at the time. â€œThere is literally no reason to arrest an illegal alien because they are specifically telling Border Patrol there will be no consequence for the illegal alien. It is a waste of time and resources to arrest someone who is off limits for detainment or deportation and the documents make that fact clear. Border Patrol agents are now being trained to be social workers, not law enforcement. â€ After the Obama Administration had put the PEP program in place, a high percentage of migrants apprehended at the border were released with a â€œnotice to appear. â€ â€œ[The Obama] administration has handcuffed the Border Patrol,â€ Babeu told reporters in a March 2016 press conference reported by Breitbart Texas.

She would not be in the hospital long. But the recovery would still be protracted and restrict her ability to care for my father, who has Parkinsonâ€™s. No worries. Her three grown children, all of whom live in distant cities, snapped into action. We would fly in for the surgery, call in extra help, telephone a few of her friends and ask them to check in, drop off some food, otherwise be on call. We congratulated ourselves for a   plan. There was only one problem. My mother insisted we not tell a soul. â€œI donâ€™t want to inconvenience my friends,â€ she said. â€œAlso, I donâ€™t want people to feel sorry for me, and I absolutely donâ€™t want to listen to all their medical stories. Itâ€™s just so wearying. â€ How people decide whether to go public with their medical conditions has long been highly sensitive and deeply personal. Certain situations, like broken limbs and cancers that require chemotherapy, are virtually impossible to keep secret. Others, like H. I. V. and mental illness, are easier to keep under wraps, at least for a time. Older people, in my experience, lean more toward secrecy younger toward disclosure. These days, all of the old rules have been thrown out. With more and more people used to sharing even the most minute details of their daily lives on social media, centuries of customs have been upended. If you post photos of yourself emptying your cat litter, filing your taxes or getting your cavity filled, you canâ€™t as easily come out later and say, â€œOh, Iâ€™ve had muscular dystrophy all these years and didnâ€™t want to tell you. â€ Or can you? My father kept his Parkinsonâ€™s quiet from even close friends for nearly a decade. â€œI was in business,â€ he said. â€œI was building things and borrowing money. I didnâ€™t want to be considered a risk. â€ (Both of them approved my writing this here.) So in our time of radical disclosure, how should patients evaluate the risks and benefits of sharing medical information?  You might save your life. Paul Wicks is a neuropsychologist and A. L. S. specialist who now serves as a vice president of the online support network Patients Like Me. His research shows that patients are most open with their family and current friends, least open with neighbors and childhood friends. Work colleagues rank in the middle. Multiple sclerosis, A. L. S. and epilepsy rank highest on conditions people disclose fibromyalgia, mood disorders and H. I. V. rank lowest. â€œWith something like H. I. V. there are very clear issues about cultural reactions and risk of infection,â€ he said. â€œBut something like organ transplants are the opposite. If you need a kidney transplant, trust me, everyone will have to know. Finding a match is nearly impossible. â€ With these qualifications, Dr. Wicks comes down strongly in favor of disclosure. His reason: You never know where you can learn something that might save your life. As a researcher, he said, â€œI used to give patients nuggets of wisdom. â€ But he added, â€œI canâ€™t meet every patient. â€ When patients seek out others with similar illnesses, their knowledge grows exponentially. â€œItâ€™s more scalable, less serendipitous,â€ he said. Even my mother, when she broke down and divulged her operation to a friend, who happened to have the same condition, radically changed her course of treatment. Dr. Wicksâ€™s research shows that patients who participate in peer groups have learned tips about drug sequencing or   specialists that proved critical to their care. â€œThe value of a   piece of information can be the difference between life and death,â€ he said. Keep calm and lurk. Stefania Vicaria is a sociologist at the University of Leicester in Britain who has studied the effect of social media on medicine. A primary thing people gain from going public is a sense of comfort in connecting with others, she told me. â€œThe first thing people get on social media is emotional support,â€ she said. â€œBut it quickly shifts to medical information as the patients go onto specialized websites and become more expert in treatments, scientific trials and so on. â€ Most people are comfortable sharing their names in   forums, she said, even if those forums are on Facebook, where membership in such a group can be visible to their friends. The information in these discussions is so valuable that if you still prefer anonymity, you should join under a pseudonym. Dr. Wicks called this lurking. â€œThe ratio of people who contribute to Wikipedia versus people who use Wikipedia is quite tiny,â€ he said. â€œYou can just lurk in these forums and still get much of the benefit. â€ Tweet defensively. For those who choose to share their conditions with their wider social networks, there is reason to be cautious. Heidi Adams is a pediatric cancer survivor who has devoted her career to helping young adults with cancer. Now the chief patient advocate at Rx4good, Ms. Adams said that while it was harder for older people to share information about their medical conditions, it was harder for young people to keep quiet. â€œIf anything, young people are likely to overshare,â€ she said. â€œYouâ€™ve been living your life in public all these years, and suddenly you have this thing you may not want to talk about. Yet posting about that scoop of ice cream you just had feels dumb. Thereâ€™s a lot of pressure. â€ Ms. Adams recommends beginning conservatively, restricting the most intimate information to the most limited outlets, like a blog or a CaringBridge site, whose privacy settings can be changed later. â€œOnce you put things on Facebook or Twitter, itâ€™s out there forever,â€ she said. â€œYou may want to share things now, but sometime down the road, are you going to want those pictures of you with your scars in public?â€ In her case, she wanted those things out there at the time of her treatment, she said, but as she moves further away from it, she has changed her mind.  Control your surrogates. When I got a cancer diagnosis nine years ago, I made a critical misstep in disclosure in my early days. I told everyone the date of my biopsy. That meant when that day came, I got way more calls than I could handle. From that day forward, I appointed a chief information officer  â€”   in my case, my brother  â€”   whose job it was to keep everyone informed. While designating such a figure can be helpful, Ms. Adams said, today itâ€™s not sufficient. Patients have to set clear parameters about what that person is allowed to say, share or post in public. â€œI donâ€™t think you should have any hesitation in telling that person: â€˜Hey, can you please take that photo down?

But, apparently, all that   has not helped us figure out how to run more efficient elections. Three weeks after the stateâ€™s Democratic presidential primary, half a million votes remain uncounted. The final tallies, whenever they come in, are not expected to change the result. Hillary Clinton declared victory the night of the June 7 primary, when she was up by more than 10 points. In videos, in blog posts and on social media, some supporters of Bernie Sanders are pointing to the uncounted ballots as evidence that Mr. Sanders was robbed. Long waits for final totals are not rare in California. Most of the 2. 5 million votes that were not counted by June 7 were   ballots that were not returned until Election Day, or even a few days after. But the vote also exposed â€œmechanical problemsâ€ in the electoral system, said Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data, a consulting firm based in Norwalk, Calif. A flood of voters registered right before the election. Many did not receive   ballots until after Election Day, when they were useless. Independents voting by mail also had a hard time getting the right ballots. Both groups were more likely to support Mr. Sanders. Many cast provisional ballots, which take a long time to count because each has to be verified. Since June 7, Mr. Sanders has slightly cut into Ms. Clintonâ€™s lead. She was ahead by roughly 440, 000 votes on election night. Now, itâ€™s 414, 500, or about eight percentage points. Still, itâ€™s a sizable margin. â€œThe Bernie folks have legitimate gripes,â€ Mr. Mitchell said. â€œBut theyâ€™re all going to be resolved when these provisional ballots are counted. â€ â€¢ Hillary Clinton released her technology policy initiative, which targets young entrepreneurs.

The mission is older than our republic itself: the first Mass was held on June 29, 1776, a few days before the Declaration of Independence was signed, and nearly 75 years before California statehood. The adobe church, which the congregation moved into in 1791, is the oldest building still standing in San Francisco. It survived the 1906 earthquake, and the fires that followed. Of the nine missions founded under the Rev. Junipero Serra in California, it is the only one whose original chapel is intact. So what is Mission Dolores  â€”   as it has long been known, though the official name is MisiÃ³n San Francisco de Asis  â€”   doing to celebrate its anniversary? Not much.

I will tell police station commanders, do not operate without a representative of the U.N. human rights commission and everybody must wear a camera so it will all be transparent.  The comments were a marked change from Duterte s usual disdain for the United Nations, which he once threatened to withdraw from after U.N. human rights experts and rapporteurs expressed concern about the huge death toll in his signature war on drugs. Thousands of people, mostly poor urban Filipinos, have been killed since he took office in June 2016. The OHCHR had no immediate comment on Duterte s remarks. Duterte has also made a public debate with U.N. envoys a prerequisite for any visit or investigation related to the anti-drug campaign. His outreach to the United Nations comes as the Philippine National Police (PNP) comes under heavy criticism over the deaths in August of two teenagers. Police say they were killed in self defense, but activists and political opponents have said it was cold-blooded murder.  Duterte and his allies were chided last week after lawmakers allied with Duterte supported giving the Philippines Commission on Human Rights an annual budget of just 1,000 pesos ($19.55), which critics at home and abroad said would be tantamount to destroying a constitutional body. The firebrand leader in a speech on Saturday taunted CHR head Chito Gascon by asking him if he was gay, or a pedophile, and if he was  smitten with teenagers , referring to his comments about the latest incident. Duterte on Monday said he had no plan to abolish the CHR. He also said the proposed 678 million peso budget would be used to buy body cameras for the PNP during anti-drug operations, to show transparency. More than 3,800 people have been killed in police anti-drugs operations in the past 15 months and at least 2,100 other homicides were likely drug-related.

But in a reflection of the improvisational style that helped fuel his rise, he has made few, if any, firm decisions about which orders he wants to make, or in which order. That is a striking break from past presidents, who have entered office with detailed plans for rolling out a series of executive actions that set a tone for their presidencies and send a clear message about their agendas. It was plain that Mr. Trump had devised no such strategy by his first day in office, as advisers expressed doubt until the last moments about whether he would issue any directives on Friday. â€œItâ€™s going to be a   decision,â€ Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that afternoon. Then, around 7 p. m. reporters were suddenly summoned to the Oval Office. After sprinting from the briefing room, they watched Mr. Trump sign a directive to federal agencies to begin scaling back parts of the Affordable Care Act. â€œThere are a number that are being looked at, but itâ€™s just a question of which ones he feels like doing, and when,â€ Mr. Spicer had said of executive orders earlier on Friday. In recent days, he had said that Mr. Trumpâ€™s top aides were still deciding on the â€œsequencingâ€ of the unilateral actions. Still, there is little doubt about the policy areas in Mr. Trumpâ€™s sights: international trade deals, illegal immigration, the fight against the Islamic State, climate change and Washington lobbying. In his first   in office, Mr. Trump focused on health care, ordering the machinery of government to look for every opportunity to pull back on President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature achievement by waiving fees or granting exemptions to states, businesses, individuals and insurance companies. He also moved quickly to freeze the Obama administrationâ€™s unfinished regulations, a routine step for an incoming president of the opposite party. During the campaign, Mr. Trump railed against Mr. Obamaâ€™s use of executive authority to sidestep an uncooperative Congress on issues like immigration and health care. After his victory, Mr. Trump vowed to use those same powers to quickly reverse the countryâ€™s ideological course. Aides said they hoped to group Mr. Trumpâ€™s executive actions thematically for maximum impact. They gave few other details, though some advisers suggested that executive actions on illegal immigration could be among the first issued after the inaugural weekend. Advocates for undocumented workers are anxiously waiting to see what Mr. Trump will do. If he moves aggressively, he could immediately overturn Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA  â€”   the program Mr. Obama created to protect young immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children, giving them legal status and access to work permits. Ending that program would put as many as 800, 000 of them at risk of being removed from their families and sent to the countries they had left as children. The White House could instead unwind the program slowly, giving the young people, often called Dreamers, more time before their immigration protections and work permits expire. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said on Friday that in a brief conversation with the new president, Mr. Trump had given him assurances about the program. The president, Mr. Durbin said, told him that â€œwe donâ€™t want to hurt those kids weâ€™re going to do something. â€ â€œThank goodness he said that,â€ the senator added. The president could also order federal agents to conduct workplace raids to crack down on immigration violations. He could take action against   sanctuary cities, those that shield undocumented immigrants from deportation. Or he could issue an order reinstating a program known as Secure Communities, in which the local authorities cooperated with federal agencies to detect and deport illegal immigrants. And he could order work to begin, at least symbolically, on a wall at the southern border. Financing construction of the entire wall would require congressional action, however. But on the border wall and other promises, Mr. Trump now faces the challenge of translating slogans into action. He has already missed the deadline for a vow he made in August to start deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records on his first day in office. â€œWe will begin moving them out, Day 1,â€ he said during a rally in Phoenix. â€œMy first hour in office, those people are gone. â€ Mr. Trumpâ€™s approach to using his newly minted executive power mirrors his often chaotic transition to the White House. The    nature of the new presidentâ€™s first 24 hours reflected his management style, both in his business empire and in the campaign, which went through four   as aides fell into and out of favor. His travel schedule was rarely planned out more than a few days in advance, and Mr. Trump did not hesitate to tear it apart when he wanted to. Decisions would be telegraphed by top advisers, only to be pulled back within hours, or never formally announced. The lack of planning stands in stark contrast to the approaches of past presidents, who have sought to demonstrate the change in direction they hope to lead and maximize the effectiveness of their unilateral actions. Ronald Reagan retreated to the Presidentâ€™s Room just off the Senate floor only moments after being sworn in and signed an order freezing federal hiring, echoing the declaration in his inaugural address that â€œgovernment is not the solution to our problem government is the problem. â€ Mr. Obama also decided well in advance which executive actions he wanted to take in his first days, after a team of lawyers led by Gregory B. Craig, his first White House counsel, spent much of his transition planning what he could do without Congress to illustrate a stark break with George W. Bushâ€™s presidency. On his second full day in office, Mr. Obama ordered the closing of the GuantÃ¡namo Bay prison  â€”   a directive still unfulfilled  â€”   and banned torture by mandating that terrorism interrogations be guided by the Army Field Manual. Mr. Obamaâ€™s embrace of executive orders  â€”   early in the administration and later, when a   Congress blocked his legislative agenda  â€”   may have helped pave the way for Mr. Trump to take quick action. Since many of Mr. Obamaâ€™s achievements were put in place with executive action, Mr. Trump can reverse them, at least over time, the same way.", "output": "1. True"}

Ms. Davis has not walked in 30 years, about a decade after she was told she had multiple sclerosis. And then in 2003, Ms. Davis, a former lawyer for CBS, learned she had invasive cancer. And so her weeks filled with chemotherapy and physical therapy appointments, in addition to her work in a second career  â€”   this time as a volunteer financial counselor. On this day, she prepared for a hectic afternoon, reviewing scheduled appointments with clients over the next month. As a Financial Coaching Corps volunteer, Ms. Davis is among 2, 500 volunteers in the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, sponsored by Community Service Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. R. S. V. P. matches volunteers  â€”   often retirees, and all of whom are at least 55 years old  â€”   with more than 350 nonprofits across New York City. It also has several signature programs, including the Financial Coaching Corps and a mentoring program for children who have a parent in prison. Founded in 2007, the Financial Coaching Corps has 34 volunteers who, in the past five years, have advised almost 4, 000 New Yorkers on their finances, helping them hone their money management skills. The goal is to give them control over their personal finances and allow them to work toward economic security. And for the past decade, despite health scares and cancer treatments, Ms. Davis has spent every Friday working with people in dire financial straits. Her desk is neat, with a rack of organized colored folders, each with its own label: â€œDispute Letters,â€ â€œCredit Report Requestsâ€ and â€œBudget Forms. â€ She has helped clients with debt management, improving their credit scores, and those recovering from identity theft. Along the way, she has forged relationships with the people she has helped. In August 2013, a retired woman with $10, 000 in arrears and credit card debt came to Ms. Davis for guidance. Over two years, Ms. Davis helped her pay off her debt. She also suggested that the woman sell her   apartment and downsize to a   apartment in the same building. The move provided her with a $50, 000 savings nest egg and some financial security. They still meet  â€”   not to discuss finances, but for lunch and afternoons spent at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And the first client to sit at her desk, in spring 2007, still visits often, Ms. Davis said. The former client, who is legally blind and lives in public housing, receives Social Security and insists that she still needs Ms. Davisâ€™s financial expertise. â€œBut, really, we just chat,â€ Ms. Davis said with a smile. For Ms. Davis, who also takes French lessons and volunteers her legal services at the New York City chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, her work with the Financial Coaching Corps is more than having something to do on Fridays. â€œThe most rewarding part is knowing that you really helped get someone on the right path,â€ she said. That same motivation pushed Gloria Perez to start volunteering shortly after she retired. She worked for more than 30 years with the cityâ€™s Human Resources Administration, helping people in need of public assistance. â€œAnd then my husband died, and I retired, and I wondered what in the world I was going to do with my life,â€ Ms. Perez said. That was in 1995, and the answer came later that year in the form of an advertisement. Another program through R. S. V. P. the Advocacy, Counseling and Entitlement Services Project, needed volunteers to work alongside the agency where she had dedicated her entire career. â€œWhen I saw it,â€ she recalled, â€œI thought, â€˜This is what Iâ€™ve been doing all along, so I ought to be able to manage this, too. â€™â€ Founded in 1984, the ACES Project trains volunteers to work as benefit counselors in   neighborhoods. It has served more than 28, 000 people in the past five years, helping those eligible to sign up for public benefits. Volunteers like Ms. Perez check whether people qualify for benefits, assist them in the application process and make referrals. More than two decades after joining the program, Ms. Perez, 84, still volunteers for six hours every Wednesday at Queens Hospital Center, in Jamaica. She sets up a table in the lobby for people to inquire about possible benefits. Many people approach her table to ask how to receive food stamps. Many others simply are not aware of the programs they qualify for, Ms. Perez said. Signing up for public benefits can involve a lot of red tape and a lot of waiting. But using her insiderâ€™s understanding of the system, she said, she once got someone placed in public housing through the cityâ€™s Department for the Aging within two weeks. The new tenant returned to the hospital to thank Ms. Perez for her help. Another woman received cash assistance the same day she turned in her application. â€œThis has become my second career,â€ Ms. Perez said with a laugh, adding that she had no intention of retiring again anytime soon.", "output": "1.

On Wednesday night, several hundred protesters crammed into the street near the hotel where Trump is scheduled to speak to congressional Republicans on Thursday to demonstrate against his agenda. â€œPhilly hates Trump!â€ and â€œNo hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here,â€ were among the demonstratorsâ€™ chants. Police said they were expecting a larger turnout of protesters on Thursday when both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence address the Republican gathering. Trump said on Wednesday he would seek a voter fraud probe, although there is overwhelming consensus among state officials, election experts and politicians that such fraud is rare in the United States. At the closed-door retreat, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan laid out a plan of legislative action including repeal of the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law known as Obamacare, by March or April, followed by appropriations for a border wall with Mexico and overhauling the tax code by August, one Republican source said. Republicans have majorities in both the House and Senate.  A senior House Republican, Representative Diane Black, said key House committees would take votes within the next two weeks on draft legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. â€œThen we expect that probably toward the latter part of February, or the first part of March, that we should be ready to go with the final reconciliation billâ€ to repeal Obamacare, she told reporters. Representative Chris Collins, a New York Republican who was an early Trump backer, said on MSNBC that lawmakers were told at the retreat that they would write legislation â€œin the next two monthsâ€ to help pay for the border wall that Trump signed directives to build. On the issue of tax reform, Ryan, speaking to MSNBC, said: â€œOur goal is to get this done by the end of summer, which is for Congress quite fast.â€  While there is Republican enthusiasm about the idea of swift action against Obamacare and on taxes, the challenge for Trump and congressional Republicans will be getting lawmakers to coalesce around specific plans. Trump won in November because he secured the most votes in the state-by-state Electoral College system, but he lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million ballots. Irked by that large figure, he has blamed voter fraud, without citing evidence, and called for an investigation. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, chair of the Senate Republican Conference, saw little need for a probe. â€œIâ€™ve not seen any evidence to that effect, but if they want to take that issue up, thatâ€™s a decision obviously that he can make,â€ Thune told reporters. â€œAll I can say is what Iâ€™ve said before, and that is that weâ€™ve moved on, the electionâ€™s over with, we had a decisive winner in our constitutional system, and weâ€™re ready to go to work,â€ he said. U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, chair of the Republican conference in the House of Representatives, took a wait-and-see attitude toward Trumpâ€™s demand for a probe. â€œItâ€™s very important that people have confidence in the elections and the outcome of those elections. And Iâ€™ll wait until I see more of what heâ€™s proposing before I comment on what his action is going to be,â€ she said. British Prime Minister Theresa May will also join lawmakers in Philadelphia on Thursday and is expected to discuss plans for a possible U.S.-U.K. trade deal.", "output": "1. True"}

The authorities, speaking at a news conference on Saturday night, identified the suspect as Arcan Cetin of Oak Harbor, Wash. He was taken into custody without incident around 6:30 p. m. Officials said that they had received numerous tips about the gunman and that surveillance footage had helped locate him. Lt. Michael Hawley of the Island County Sheriffâ€™s Office said he had received a report that Mr. Cetinâ€™s car was less than a mile from his office and when he headed that way, he found Mr. Cetin walking on the sidewalk. Mr. Cetin was carrying a satchel with a computer inside and was in a â€œzombielikeâ€ state when he was taken into custody, the lieutenant said. Charges were pending, said the authorities, who said it was too early to say what led to the shootings. On his Facebook page, Mr. Cetin listed his hometown as Adana, Turkey. Officials said he was a legal permanent resident of the United States. He graduated last year from Oak Harbor High School and listed himself on Facebook as a bagger at the Whidbey Island Commissary. Little of his personality could be gleaned from his sparse social media presence, which included only 56 posts on Twitter. His Facebook page offered a glimpse of his life. A posting by a friend in 2011 described him as â€œreally annoying,â€ â€œfunnyâ€ and â€œsometimes really nasty. â€ Mr. Cetin referred to lifting weights in high school and posted videos of the video game Call of Duty. Another Facebook posting, by a friend in 2012, said of Mr. Cetin: â€œTruth is: You are a very odd character. You were always going on about being Russian and stuff like that, but under that you really supported America (or so it seemed to me) and I always thought that was really cool. â€ Mr. Cetin was active in the Reserve Officers Training Corps, said a former classmate, Uhlaine Finnigan, 19, of Port Angeles, Wash. She called Mr. Cetin â€œsexistâ€ and said he would touch girls on their buttocks, â€œeither slapping or grabbing them. â€ â€œHe did that to girls of all grades at the high school including my best friend and I, regardless of the blatant disgust from the girls and being told to stop,â€ she said in an interview by Facebook Messenger. She said he appeared to have few friends. The attacker at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Wash. killed four women in the cosmetics section of a Macyâ€™s department store, the authorities said. A man was critically wounded in the shooting and was taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where he died. The youngest female victim was a teenager, law enforcement officials said at a news conference on Saturday morning. The gunman, who was armed with a rifle, left the scene before the police arrived. Officials said they recovered the weapon at the scene. They declined to give details about the weapon or to say how many rounds were fired. Photographs of Mr. Cetin on a Myspace account showed him holding a handgun and a rifle. A spokesman for the F. B. I. â€™s Seattle field office said on Saturday that there was no evidence to suggest that the shooting was an act of terrorism. At the news conference on Saturday night, Mayor Steve Sexton of Burlington said the shootings happened at a time and in a setting that were ordinary: a Friday night at a mall. Referring to the shootings, he said: â€œThey changed those families forever. It changed our city, Iâ€™m afraid to some extent, forever. â€ The names of the victims had not yet been released by officials. Security camera footage showed the man entering the mall without a weapon. Footage taken 10 minutes later showed him entering Macyâ€™s with a rifle. At the news conference earlier on Saturday, the authorities described the tense moments after the shooting, as officers searched the roughly    mall for the attacker, finding only store employees and shoppers. Police officers entered the mall in teams, unaware during the search, which lasted for hours, that the gunman had fled before their arrival. They searched â€œevery room and every nook and cranny,â€ said Lt. Chris Cammock, the commander of the multiagency response team conducting the investigation. The F. B. I. said early Saturday that it had â€œno information to suggest that additional attacksâ€ were planned in Washington State, and that it was coordinating intelligence efforts with the local authorities. More than 200 officers from at least 26 agencies responded to the shooting, the authorities said. One woman, Tari Caswell, told The Skagit Valley Herald that she had been in the Macyâ€™s womenâ€™s dressing room when she heard four loud pops, followed by seven or eight more. â€œI just stayed quiet in the dressing room because it just didnâ€™t feel right,â€ she said. â€œAnd it got very quiet. And then I heard a lady yelling for help, and a man came and got me and another lady, and we ran out of the store. â€ Saturdayâ€™s shooting was at least the fifth in Washington this year in which three or more people died, according to the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive.", "output": "1.

Two separate groups entered the DNCâ€™s system, and one read email and chat communications for nearly a year before being detected, according to the committee and CrowdStrike, the cyber firm that helped clean up the breach. Russian spies also targeted the networks of Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as the computers of some Republican political action committees, the Washington Post quoted U.S. officials as saying, although details were not available. A Clinton campaign official said there was no evidence the campaignâ€™s information systems had been hacked. A Russian government spokesman denied involvement in the breach. â€œI completely rule out a possibility that the (Russian) government or the government bodies have been involved in this,â€ Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, told Reuters in Moscow. The intrusion is emblematic of the sophistication of Russian hackers, who intelligence officials have long viewed as the most talented of U.S. adversaries in cyberspace. The Democratic Party had been aware of efforts to hack Trump material for two months, and U.S. intelligence agencies were involved in efforts to find out who was behind the hacking, a source familiar with Trump opposition research said. The source said Democratic Party operatives believed the hacking was conducted by the Russian government. The research includes material on Trumpâ€™s business efforts in Azerbaijan, Georgia, Serbia and Russia, according to information made available to Reuters.         Cyber attacks against political candidates and organizations are common worldwide. U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper said last month he was aware of attempted hacks on campaigns and related groups and he expected to see more as the Nov. 8 presidential election nears. U.S. Representative Jim Langevin, a Democrat and co-founder of the congressional cybersecurity caucus, said it was â€œdisconcertingâ€ that independent groups penetrated the DNC and that one was able â€œto stay embedded for nearly a year.â€ But the groups are extremely sophisticated, Langevin said, and have previously been implicated on attacks at the White House, the State Department and the German Bundestag, as well as a number of private companies. The DNC contacted CrowdStrike in May and within 24 hours it began investigating unusual activity on the groupâ€™s network, said Dmitri Alperovitch, the companyâ€™s co-founder and chief technology officer. It identified two hacking groups and both were kicked out this weekend, he said. The first, which CrowdStrike named Cozy Bear, entered the DNCâ€™s systems last summer, according to the firm. It primarily monitored email and chat conversations and may be working for Russiaâ€™s Federal Security Service, or FSB, Alperovitch said.  Russian President Vladimir Putin once ran the FSB. The second group, nicknamed Fancy Bear, is probably working on behalf of Russiaâ€™s military, Alperovitch said. It gained entry in late April and â€œwent straight to the oppo research ... on Donald Trump and exfiltrated some of it,â€ he said. Alperovitch said both groups were among â€œthe best threat actors that weâ€™ve ever encounteredâ€ but they did not appear to be working together. He was not sure how the intrusions occurred but suspected the hackers may have leveraged â€œspearphishingâ€ emails to trick DNC employees into downloading malicious code onto their network. â€œWhen we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is,â€ Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the DNC, said in a statement. â€œOur team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network.â€ Trumpâ€™s interest in Russia goes back to the 1980s, with a 1990 Vanity Fair article citing news program appearances in which Trump offered his own services as a negotiator with Russia.

Quickly, I began to feel as if Iâ€™d wandered into the plot of a Philip K. Dick novel, or succumbed to an especially unnerving fever dream. The book, by Zachary Karabell, tells the story of a deeply unpopular and untrustworthy New Yorker who, against all odds, achieves the presidency. Arthur, a   emblem of the   culture of the day, was never even elected to the highest office. His ascent was made possible by Charles J. Guiteau, the man who gunned down President James Garfield in a railroad station, thus promoting Arthur from the vice presidency. To contemporaries, the situation seemed dire. Arthurâ€™s administration surely would be defined by unprecedented greed and corruption, full of woefully underqualified appointees lacking any experience in government. Even the most optimistic American could hardly have imagined that Arthurâ€™s presidency would be a success. But as I continued reading, I was astonished to discover that Arthur redeemed himself. He championed   reform, hobbling the â€œspoils systemâ€ with which he had been so closely associated. He restored faith in the presidency, and faith in what the presidency can restore in its occupants. â€œNo man ever entered the presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester Alan Arthur,â€ wrote the Gilded Age journalist Alexander K. McClure, â€œand no one ever retired . .. more generally respected, alike by political friend and foe. â€ I finished the biography in late 2016, but found myself still carrying it with me as Donald J. Trump prepared to take office. I wasnâ€™t rereading it, not exactly. Sometimes, when my dog lingered by a particularly intriguing tree, Iâ€™d open it up to a passage Iâ€™d marked. Other times, it served as a base for my phone, as if it were in conversation with the disquieting tweets I scrolled through. And during those notably edgy moments in late January, Iâ€™d hold onto it tight, like a security blanket, or just want it nearby, so that I could occasionally tap on it like a talisman. As an American historian, Iâ€™ve long relied on presidential biographies for edification and pleasure. If Iâ€™m using biographies to write a book or an essay, I have them propped up on a stand, next to my highlighters, pencils,   Notes and paper clips. But now my work doubles as an antidepressant these books are rife with the kind of horrors that led half of the country to believe, at any given time, that they were living out the end of the American experiment. I now surround myself with presidential biographies the way I would tissues if I had the flu. Thereâ€™s a stack of them next to my bed, a few by the front door and some more next to the couch. Youâ€™ll spot them on my windowsill and   table, above the fridge and in my bathroom. Theyâ€™re hidden around my car, and just this morning I remembered that Iâ€™d tucked a small published conference paper on George Washingtonâ€™s nationalism into the interior pocket of my North Face puffy jacket. This obsession comes with a physical cost. The tomes make the straps of my bag dig painfully into my shoulder. Even the slenderest of biographies from the Arthur Schlesinger presidential series runs around 200 pages, and a Ron Chernow joint will push past 800. There are other costs, too. Having found some solace in these countless moments of national resilience amid chaos, I find myself constantly pushing these biographies onto others, believing in their therapeutic powers, and replacing my own copies time and again. Calvin Coolidge had a major depressive episode and basically checked out, I texted a worried friend  â€”   but we survived, I added, asking for her address. F. D. R. was an aristocrat before he contracted polio, I told another over drinks, reluctantly sliding over a   volume about how suffering transformed him. Ronald Reagan tried and failed to do away with the Energy and Education Departments, I told an acquaintance who teaches English. I was lugging around a thick George H. W. Bush book a few months ago when I decided, on the walk to an event where Iâ€™d be speaking, against reading from the biography and instead to read a segment Iâ€™d written for my podcast, â€œPresidents Are People, Too!â€ The eventâ€™s hosts quickly cued up a recent photo of Bush and his wife, which shone behind me as I read a letter George wrote about Barbara in 1943. The audience howled at the line â€œshe is so very young and so darn attractive. â€ But they might have laughed harder at the concerned email he wrote to his eldest granddaughters when they were off on spring break, shortly after he came across what he called the â€œâ€™u2009â€˜Wild College Womenâ€™ TV show. â€ Presidential biographies donâ€™t tell you that everything is going to be O. K. but rather that nothing was ever really O. K. to begin with. And yet, for hundreds of years, Americans have not only survived heartbreaking, backbreaking periods but also stood tall in them. My advice, for these divisive times, is to find the perspective that history gives us. The next time you feel anxious or incensed, or even if you feel hopeful and gratified, turn off the television. Close your laptop. Silence your phone. Go ahead and put it   down for the rest of the evening. Instead, choose to hang out with the likes of President Chester A.

He wore black shorts and a black basketball jersey, and his haircut straddled the line between a   and a fade a racket bag was slung over his shoulders, and his eyes were fixed on two smartphones, one in each hand. Kyrgios, a    Australian of Greek and Malaysian descent  â€”   and quite possibly the most gifted tennis player to come along since Roger Federer  â€”   was accompanied by an improbable crew: a    from Philadelphia named Tauheed Browning and a    from Maryland named Langston Williams, two promising juniors who were training at the academy. They had bonded with Kyrgios over a shared infatuation with PokÃ©mon GO, the blockbuster mobile game, and the three were apparently now inseparable. They had gone to the movies and the mall together. They were playing the game, laughing and talking excitedly, as they arrived at the practice court. Kyrgios, who recently reached a   ranking of No. 16 in the world, took a seat, put down the phones, opened his bag and pulled out a racket. â€œItâ€™s important to find a balance between PokÃ©mon and training,â€ he said, with only the faintest hint of sarcasm. Browning eyed the racket for a moment, then asked, â€œWhat strings do you use?â€ Kyrgios said they were supplied by his racket manufacturer, Yonex. So what did he do when all of his strings broke? â€œThen I donâ€™t practice till I get to the next tournament,â€ Kyrgios replied. I laughed, but Browning seemed to take this answer seriously, and Kyrgios gave no indication that he was joking. Maybe he wasnâ€™t. When I asked Kyrgios what size racket head he used, he shrugged and said, â€œNo idea. â€ His girlfriend, a   player named Ajla Tomljanovic, was out on the court, hitting with her father the family dog ran between them, furiously trying to intercept the ball. Tomljanovic, who is two years older than Kyrgios and applied for Australian citizenship last year, didnâ€™t appear to mind sharing her boyfriendâ€™s attention with Browning, Williams and PokÃ©mon  â€”   although later in the day, at a photo shoot in West Palm Beach, she expressed some mild exasperation when Kyrgios, summoned to the wardrobe room, implored her to take over his game. â€œIâ€™m not playing PokÃ©mon with your    friend,â€ she said. Kyrgios quickly corrected her, albeit incorrectly: â€œHeâ€™s 10, not 7. â€ Kyrgios would be leaving the next day for Toronto, to play in his first tournament since Wimbledon. He had an eventful Wimbledon this year. On the plus side, he won three tough matches and left fans and commentators swooning over his flashy play  â€”   particularly a    lob against his   opponent, the crafty veteran Radek Stepanek, which might have been the shot of the fortnight. With his bullying serve, haymaker forehand and knack for carnivalesque shots, Kyrgios is wildly entertaining to watch. Pretty much everyone around the game agrees that he has the talent to reach No. 1 and win a fistful of majors. But Kyrgios is as tempestuous as he is precocious, and his strong play at Wimbledon was overshadowed by his occasionally foul language, the invective that he hurled at his entourage and, above all, the ignominious way that he exited the tournament. In his   match, he faced Andy Murray, the eventual champion, on Centre Court. Two years earlier, on the same court, Kyrgios upset Rafael Nadal, then ranked No. 1, in a   match, a victory that signaled his emergence as a rising star doing the same to Murray would have cemented his status as the next big star of menâ€™s tennis. But after dropping a tight first set, Kyrgios gave up. He didnâ€™t entirely stop trying, but it was obvious that he just wanted to be on the next flight out of Heathrow. â€œThis is Wimbledon!â€ John McEnroe fumed. â€œHow much better a chance are you going to get to play a match and step up?â€ That was bad enough it didnâ€™t help when he later admitted that he had spent the morning playing video games. In his postmatch press conference, Kyrgios was somber and uncharacteristically  . â€œI think when things get tough, Iâ€™m just a little bit soft,â€ he said. Soon enough, though, he was back to his normal pugnacious self. Kyrgios is notorious for his Twitter spats, and when he saw a series of caustic tweets from the British media figure Piers Morgan  â€”   calling him, among other things, a â€œpetulant little bratâ€  â€”   Kyrgios couldnâ€™t let the insults go unanswered. (â€œEAD,â€ he replied the E is for â€œeat,â€ and you can look the rest up.) The Murray match wasnâ€™t Kyrgiosâ€™s lowest moment. That remains the incident in Montreal last summer, when he told the Swiss star Stan Wawrinka between points that his girlfriend had slept with another player. (Kyrgios later apologized.) Still, his desultory Wimbledon performance left the tennis world scratching its head. Before the tournament, there was much talk about Kyrgiosâ€™s need for a coach heâ€™d been without one for more than a year. Afterward, some observers, including Murray, gently suggested that perhaps what Kyrgios needed even more than a coach was a psychologist. Presumably, though, Kyrgios would tell a shrink the same thing that he tells journalists: His problem is tennis. â€œI donâ€™t love this sport,â€ he said during the Wimbledon press conference. When we spoke in Florida, Kyrgios insisted he was being honest about this: â€œIf I won a Grand Slam, Iâ€™d say the same thing. â€ He told me that he almost never watches tennis (â€œno chance, Jesus, Iâ€™d rather watch Piers Morganâ€) and that he plans to quit playing it by age 27 (â€œthatâ€™s the absolute maxâ€) after which he can pursue his true passion: basketball. He hopes to play professionally, perhaps in Europe. He played competitively as a kid and still plays every chance he gets. During a visit to Nikeâ€™s Oregon headquarters, he spent all his free time on the basketball court at tournaments, he organizes pickup games with other tennis players. His style on the tennis court, with its   passing shots and    razzmatazz, sometimes makes him look as if heâ€™s trying to play basketball there too. People around the game have trouble believing Kyrgios is really as down on tennis as he claims they figure the ambivalence is just his way of deflecting pressure. The expectations for him are huge, and not just because he is so talented. Tennis is approaching a period of transition. Federer just turned 35, a step closer to retirement. The Williams sisters are in their  . Kyrgios, with his billboard looks and outsize personality, is seen as the one emerging star who can attract new fans and keep old ones from drifting away. (Heâ€™s terrific with fans  â€”   funny, charming and unusually generous with his time, even working the crowd during matches.) His agents are convinced he could become the sportâ€™s most bankable star yet. Justin Gimelstob, a former player now working as an analyst for the Tennis Channel, put it succinctly when I asked him about Kyrgios: â€œHeâ€™s box office. â€ Ever since the retirements of McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, it has been fashionable to claim that tennis lacks â€œpersonalities. â€ In tennis, the word connotes rogues, rebels and freethinkers, although Martin Amis had a point when he wrote that â€œpersonalitiesâ€ was just   for â€œa   duosyllable starting with an A and ending with an E. â€ (Itâ€™s almost exclusively applied in menâ€™s tennis. The womenâ€™s game has had plenty of charismatic figures but not so many   and potty mouths, thanks in part to the usual double standards about acceptable behavior  â€”   double standards that Serena Williamsâ€™s occasional outbursts are just beginning to challenge.) It is certainly true that McEnroe and Connors, along with Ilie Nastase, set standards for lewdness and irascibility that no one since has come close to equaling. But itâ€™s not quite true to say the game hasnâ€™t produced any colorful characters in their aftermath: Players like Andre Agassi, Marat Safin and Goran Ivanisevic were tortured figures whose matches often turned into psychodramas. Lately, however, menâ€™s tennis isnâ€™t turning out stormy souls as reliably as it did in the past. With a few exceptions, the players behave impeccably, on the court and off they exude equanimity and seriousness of purpose and are careful not to say anything offensive. A surfeit of gentlemen is far from the worst fate to befall a sport, and complaining about it might seem obscenely   coming at the end of the most spectacular era that the menâ€™s game has ever seen  â€”   Federer with a record 17 Grand Slam singles titles Nadal, 14 Djokovic, 12, the three combining to win 43 of the last 53 majors. Still: Even    greatness can get a little tedious, and the fact is that fans, especially casual ones, are drawn to firebrands and eccentrics. Tennis was perhaps never more popular than when McEnroe and Connors were scandalizing the sportâ€™s old guard. Even Federer, a beacon of Old World graciousness, has bemoaned the current shortage of salty characters, complaining that players are now â€œalmost too nice to each other. â€ Why did menâ€™s tennis become so much tamer? Money is surely part of it. Tennis is much more lucrative than it was 30 years ago, and the players tend to think of themselves as precious brands  â€”   the Wimbledon finalist Milos Raonic describes himself without irony as the â€œC. E. O. of Milos Raonic Tennis. â€ When Agassi pitched Canon cameras by declaring that â€œimage is everything,â€ the line was celebrating his own iconoclasm (the denim shorts, the blond rattail) todayâ€™s players agree with the sentiment but prefer an image thatâ€™s likable, decorous and safe. One paradox of tennis is that whatâ€™s good for the sport  â€”   clashes, controversies and divisive figures  â€”   can be bad for individual playersâ€™ bottom lines. I suspect the gentility also has something to do with how the game itself has evolved over the last  : What used to be a battle of finesse and guile is increasingly a test of strength and endurance, full of   matches and   rallies. Itâ€™s so demanding, physically and mentally, that keeping emotions in check and avoiding distractions is a necessary survival strategy. Kyrgiosâ€™s refusal to submit to convention is a refreshing departure from all this. It says a lot about his talent that he has managed to break into the top 20 while spurning the standard recipe for success  â€”   even basics like having a coach. But the maverick act can wear thin. What made players like McEnroe and Connors such intriguing figures was that amid all the meshugas, they rose to the pinnacle of the sport. If they hadnâ€™t won majors, hadnâ€™t reached No. 1, they would have become cautionary tales, not legends. The question for Kyrgios is whether he can achieve similar success without changing his approach and becoming more committed. That seems unlikely, as even he implicitly acknowledged when we spoke. Because he was his own coach, I asked what advice he would give himself if he wanted to win majors. He thought about it for a moment, then said: â€œTrain more than four times a week. â€ After a pause, he continued. â€œI donâ€™t have a doubt that if I wanted to win Grand Slams, I would commit,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™d train two times a day, Iâ€™d go to the gym every day, Iâ€™d stretch, Iâ€™d do rehab, Iâ€™d eat right. But I donâ€™t know what I want at the moment. Am I content? I donâ€™t have a coach, I can train every now and then. I can take it easy and be maybe   my entire career. Am I O. K. with that? I donâ€™t know. â€ â€œChubby, mouthy, but unbelievable hand skills. â€ Those were the words that John Morris, one of Kyrgiosâ€™s agents, jotted down in his notebook the first time he saw him play, during the juniors competition at the 2010 Australian Open. Morris, a     from Britain, was in Melbourne scouting potential clients. Itâ€™s hard to believe when you look at Kyrgios today  â€”   now a sinewy    with chiseled features  â€”   but just six years ago he was relatively short and quite pudgy, a raw talent from Canberra whose prospects seemed to be limited by his waistline. Nick was the last of three children born to Giorgos and Norlaila Kyrgios. Giorgos immigrated to Australia from Greece as a child and works as a house painter Norlaila was born in Malaysia and moved to Australia with her mother when she was 12. Neither played much tennis, but all three of their children took up the sport. Kyrgios says his parents pushed him to choose tennis over basketball when he was 14, but they were not pushy â€œtennis parentsâ€ by all accounts, they were   and quite gracious. Kyrgios himself was said to have been a bit spoiled, indulged in the way that babies of the family often are. Still, in the   Canberra tennis community, he was generally well regarded, as were his parents. He was overweight from a young age. He told me he didnâ€™t have a poor diet as a kid, although his grandmother often treated him to Kentucky Fried Chicken after school he just ate a lot. The weight made him slow and limited his endurance. It was his effort to find a way around these liabilities that helped turn him into the player we see today. To compensate for his lack of speed, he learned to read the game better than other kids, to know where an opponentâ€™s shot was likely to land before the ball was even struck. And because he needed to end points before his stamina flagged, he developed the   attacking style that is the hallmark of his game. Somehow, he managed to do all this while resisting the rote drilling that is the bedrock of tennis training. From the start, he had no patience for that kind of practicing he just wanted to play, and he was so competitive that if no one was keeping score, he wasnâ€™t interested. That is still the case. In 2011, at 16, Kyrgios played with the Australian squad at a Junior Davis Cup tournament in Mexico. Pat Cash, a former Wimbledon champion, was the captain of the team. When Cash and I spoke in the playersâ€™ lounge at Wimbledon this year, he told me heâ€™d been struck by the racket speed that Kyrgios generated: â€œHis arm was so fast, it was like he was playing with a toothpick. â€ He was also blown away by Kyrgiosâ€™s rare combination of power and control. Cash played against a    Nadal, and what he saw in Mexico convinced him that Kyrgios was every bit as promising. There were some red flags, though. Cash took the players out for dinner one night and watched Kyrgios inhale two massive burritos  â€”   â€œthe biggest things youâ€™ve ever seen, must have been 4, 000 caloriesâ€  â€”   which made him wonder if Kyrgios would ever lose his paunch. Kyrgios was also prone to inexplicable meltdowns and moments of rebellion. During one match, he was crushing a player from Argentina when he suddenly came unhinged, shouting, â€œI canâ€™t play, I have no rhythm,â€ before throwing away the second set. On the night before the semifinals, Cash was horrified to discover that Kyrgios, despite nursing a strained muscle, organized a   competition with teammates on a nearby field. â€œHe was the ringleader, the cheeky one, the one with the jokes,â€ Cash told me. Despite the high jinks, histrionics and burritos, Cash came away convinced that Kyrgios was special. At the end of the tournament, he took him aside and said: â€œNick, no offense to these other guys, but you are unbelievably talented. You can make it. You can be holding the big trophies. â€ Fifteen months later, Kyrgios, who had finally experienced a growth spurt and was slimming down, won the Junior Australian Open boysâ€™ singles title. The victory instantly marked him as a great hope for Australian tennis  â€”   no easy role. Australia is a   nation, and because it has turned out so many celebrated players (Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, Ken Rosewall, Margaret Smith Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Pat Cash, Patrick Rafter, the list goes on) tennis is central to its sporting identity. These players werenâ€™t just great champions, either they embodied a culture and an ethos. They were     athletes, tenacious competitors but also paragons of good cheer and sportsmanship. Kyrgios is the prodigal heir to this tradition. With his brash manner and flamboyant personal style  â€”   showy haircut, sculpted eyebrows, gold chains  â€”   he seems more American than Australian, and his misbehavior and occasional lack of effort infuriate many of his compatriots. At this point,   about Kyrgios has become a popular Australian pastime. Last year, the cricket legend Shane Warne posted an open letter to Kyrgios on Facebook, saying, â€œYouâ€™re testing our patience, mate,â€ and urging him to shape up. After Kyrgios was fined $1, 500 for shouting an obscenity at a tournament last fall in Shanghai, the   football star Taylor (Tex) Walker blasted him on Twitter: â€œWhen is this absolute galoot going to learn. What a dead set flog! !â€ Kyrgios has reason for hard feelings, too. Some of the criticism he has received can take on racial undertones. There was unmistakable nativism at play when the former Olympic champion swimmer Dawn Fraser said last year that if Kyrgios and the fellow tennis bad boy Bernard Tomic, whose parents are from the former Yugoslavia, didnâ€™t improve their behavior, they should â€œgo back to where their fathers and parents came from. We donâ€™t need them here in this country. â€ (She later apologized.) The two came under fire again in May, this time from the chef de mission of the Australian Olympic team, a former pentathlete named Kitty Chiller, who warned that if they didnâ€™t curb their antics, they could be kept home from the Rio Games. Her decision to put the players on public notice struck even people not normally sympathetic to Kyrgios as needlessly confrontational. Tomic immediately announced that he would be skipping Rio Kyrgios followed suit a few weeks later. Although they had a   spat earlier this year, after Tomic suggested that Kyrgios faked illness to get out of a Davis Cup match, the two players are good friends and enjoy the kind of spirited relationship you would expect of guys in their early 20s with   bank accounts  â€”   like the time Kyrgios, along with a few other players,   Tomicâ€™s Lamborghini. Two days after I saw him in Florida, Kyrgios lost his   match in Toronto to a Canadian teenager ranked No. 370 in the world. Before the match, Kyrgios tweeted: â€œEat, Sleep, PokÃ©mon GO,â€ and he evidently still had Squirtles and Venusaurs on the brain when he took the court he served an appalling 18 double faults, 10 more than Murray coughed up over the course of two weeks and seven matches at Wimbledon. In a press conference, he pointed out the enthusiastic backing his opponent received and took a swipe at his own countrymen: â€œI think Canadians support their athletes a little better than the Australians do,â€ he said. In 2015, Kyrgios signed a contract with   the sports management colossus whose tennis clients include Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams. But he did not cut loose John Morris, so he now has two agents: Morris and Carlos Fleming, a   veteran whose clients also include the N. F. L. star Cam Newton. Morris travels with Kyrgios and handles    management Fleming supports the growth of the Kyrgios brand. When we met at Wimbledon, in the backyard of a stately house   rented for the tournament, Fleming told me the agency tracked Kyrgiosâ€™s progress over a number of years before going after him in earnest. It was after he beat Nadal at Wimbledon two years ago that Fleming and his colleagues pressed to bring him into their stable. â€œThat set off the alarm bell,â€ as Fleming put it. To hear Fleming tell it, Kyrgiosâ€™s supposed vices were actually virtues. His combustive personality might rankle tennis traditionalists and some members of the media, but it was a boon for the sport. â€œHeâ€™s unscripted, he can bring in casual fans  â€”   heâ€™s one of the few athletes who can do that,â€ Fleming said. â€œItâ€™s extremely refreshing. â€ He went on to say that Kyrgios, a product and exemplar of what he called â€œmodern urban youth culture,â€ could unlock all sorts of unprecedented opportunities for himself and, by extension, for tennis. He cited Kyrgiosâ€™s endorsement deal with Beats by Dre and also told me that the N. B. A. had expressed interest in working with him on   activities. To Fleming, Kyrgios had the potential to become a trendsetter and marketing phenom beyond anything tennis has seen. But he quickly added a qualifier: â€œWinning is the first thing. â€ And despite all the distractions and all the ambivalence, Kyrgios has done a lot of winning. In the last two years, he has notched victories over Nadal, Federer and Murray. In February, he won his first A. T. P. title in Marseilles, and he won his second earlier this month in Atlanta. His forehand  â€”   heavy, sharply angled  â€”   is spoken of with awe by his peers, but his serve may be an even bigger weapon, because of both the pace he generates (as high as 130 miles an hour on his first serve when the racket strikes, it sounds like a tree limb snapping) and his ability to place the ball. He plays very fast, and when he is serving well, he closes out games in barely a minute. He faced Raonic in the quarterfinals of a tournament in Miami in March, and over the course of four service games in the second set, he surrendered just one point. Itâ€™s the kind of efficiency that invites comparisons to Federer and Pete Sampras, who held the record for major titles until Federer eclipsed him. But Kyrgios is still a raw talent, and if he wants to break into the top 10 and contend for majors, heâ€™ll probably need a coach. He has found a mentor of sorts in Radek Stepanek, who is basically his antithesis  â€”   a    tennis lifer who adores the game and plans to keep playing until his body gives out. When I talked to Stepanek the day after the two faced off at Wimbledon, he said that theyâ€™d struck up a friendship after practicing together in Miami, and that he had offered Kyrgios some general suggestions, along with tips for playing specific opponents. But the first thing they talked about, he said, was attitude: â€œI told him, â€˜If you donâ€™t want to be here, then you should go home. â€™â€™u2009â€ Stepanek said that he was happy to contribute what he could to Kyrgiosâ€™s development, but he had no interest in becoming a   coach he was busy with his own career. A number of people have expressed interest in coaching Kyrgios, but others wonder whether it would just be wasted effort. â€œYou have to be willing to listen, and you have to have some respect,â€ Pat Cash says. â€œHis behavior toward a lot of people shows that he may not be good at either of those things. â€ His second match at Wimbledon  â€”   against Dustin Brown, a dreadlocked   renowned for his shotmaking prowess  â€”   illustrated the challenge a coach would face. Kyrgios was the better player, but it was clear from the start that he had no intention of ceding the highlight reel to Brown he was determined to match him, crazy shot for crazy shot. The first set was tennisâ€™s version of   contest, a showboating extravaganza. A coach would have implored Kyrgios to stick with plain vanilla tennis, but itâ€™s doubtful he would have listened. As Kyrgios told me, â€œI like to hit fun shots. â€ He ended up beating Brown in five sets, but his lack of discipline made the match far more difficult than it might otherwise have been. Could the â€œfun shotsâ€ be Kyrgiosâ€™s way of finding pleasure in a sport that he says doesnâ€™t offer him a lot of fulfillment? Itâ€™s possible that the ambivalence he expresses about tennis really is his way of deflecting pressure, or that he does it just to get a rise out of people heâ€™s only 21, and his game has matured much faster than he has. But maybe, when he says that he doesnâ€™t love tennis, he is telling the truth. It wouldnâ€™t necessarily doom his career: Agassi reached No. 1 and claimed eight major titles even though he spent much of his life hating tennis. John Morris told me Kyrgios is so competitive  â€”   they play I Spy on car trips, and Kyrgios goes bonkers if he doesnâ€™t win  â€”   that he might end up atop the sport in spite of how he feels about it. For now, he remains one of those players who gratify and torment tennis fans in equal measure. Some athletes spend their careers thrilling us, others spend their careers frustrating us and some do both. Maybe Kyrgios is destined to be one of those. That Saturday in Boca, though, recharged by a recent visit home and together with his girlfriend, Kyrgios seemed content to be on the tennis court. He was practicing with a pair of    Americans, Gianni Ross and Sam Riffice, in a typical Kyrgios practice session: He just wanted to play points, while keeping up a running commentary for his audience, a group that included me, Rossâ€™s parents, Tomljanovicâ€™s father, a couple of teenage girls who were apparently there to ogle and Robbye Poole, Serena Williamsâ€™s hitting partner, who happened to be at the academy that day. His PokÃ©mon buddy Tauheed Browning was perched by the fence on Kyrgiosâ€™s side of the court. At one point, I overheard Kyrgios jokingly upbraiding him, saying, â€œYouâ€™re supposed to be my coach!â€ After maybe 30 minutes, Kyrgios decided it was time to kick back. He summoned Browning, Langston Williams and Poole to join in for some Touch Tennis, a game in which players stand close to the net and hit delicate flick shots back and forth until someone misses. Browning ended up losing and was promptly exiled to the far end of the court for a round of Butts Up, in which a player stands motionless while the others try to hit serves into his posterior. Just as he was on that Mexico trip with Pat Cash, Kyrgios was the ringleader and the guy having the most fun  â€”   laughing, shouting, throwing his racket in feigned disgust. This was tennis on his terms, and he seemed genuinely happy.", "output": "1. True"}

She originally faced 25 years to life in prison under a count of continuous sexual abuse of a child. Her guilty plea capped any potential jail time she may serve at 30 years. The deal she struck could have allowed Vera to serve a deferred adjudication sentence, a type of probation that would leave her without a criminal record if she completed it successfully. Vera remained free on $100, 000 bail since surrendering herself to authorities in June, although she had to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet and abide by other restrictions, including steering clear of schools and having no contact with the teen who purportedly impregnated her. Over the summer, though, she landed back in McSpaddenâ€™s court for violating a condition of her bond agreement. She returned home from shopping later than her curfew. Court documents revealed Vera met the boy during a 2015 summer school session at Stovall Middle School where she taught. Prior to any sexual misconduct, the inappropriate relationship started over social media. The boy tried to reach her on Instagram. Vera later messaged him after he missed class. This led to the student asking for her phone number. Vera claimed the boyâ€™s parents supported the relationship and were even happy when she reportedly announced her pregnancy to them. She believed she did nothing wrong because she just fell in love, according to court documents. She allegedly had an abortion once school authorities began questioning her about the improper relationship. Speculation swirled that the boyâ€™s parents might face the criminal charge of failure to report child abuse.

At the same time, the party said it raised its target to $4.5 million, with filing deadlines approaching in Pennsylvania on Monday and Michigan on Wednesday. Stein is pushing for recounts because experts pointed to statistical anomalies in the tallies in all three battleground states, according to the partyâ€™s website.  Trump, a Republican who ran as an anti-establishment maverick, carried all three states by narrow margins despite public opinion polls pointing to victories by Hillary Clinton, the Democratic standard-bearer. â€œWe deserve elections we can trust,â€ the campaign said, adding that the effort was not intended to help Clinton. A representative of the president-electâ€™s transition team could not be reached for comment. But Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, suggested that efforts to force recounts were ironic, given harsh criticism of Trump before the election when he would not say whether he would accept the result of what he called a â€œriggedâ€ political system. â€œLook who canâ€™t accept the election results,â€ Conway said in a Twitter message, pointing to a headline in the New York Times that read â€œHillary Clinton Supporters Call for Vote Recount in Battleground States.â€ Although Clinton won more votes than Trump on a nationwide basis, the real estate developer exceeded the number of votes in the Electoral College needed to take the presidency. Electoral votes are apportioned state by state, mostly on a winner-take-all basis.  Stein took a little more than 1 percent of the popular vote, while Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson came in third place behind Trump and Clinton.

The terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but publishing industry executives with knowledge of the bidding process said it probably stretched well into eight figures. Robert B. Barnett and Deneen C. Howell of Williams  Connolly represented the Obamas. Penguin Random House acquired world rights to the books, and worldwide sales could be substantial. No decision has been made yet as to which of the companyâ€™s major imprints  â€”   which include Random House, Doubleday, Alfred A. Knopf and Crown  â€”   will publish the books. Mr. Obamaâ€™s previous books were published by Crown, which also published Mrs. Obamaâ€™s book â€œAmerican Grown,â€ about the White House garden. A spokeswoman for Penguin Random House would not say whether the books would be memoirs and referred questions to representatives of the Obamas. Speculation about the Obamasâ€™ books and how much they would sell for have been circulating in the industry in recent weeks, as executives at the top publishing houses met separately with the former president and first lady. Some publishing executives who followed the bidding process said that the opening offers for Mr. Obamaâ€™s book alone were in the $18 million to $20 million range. The publisher plans to donate one million books in the Obama familyâ€™s name to First Book, a nonprofit organization that provides books to disadvantaged children, and it will continue to provide digital copies to Open eBooks, which grew out of the 2016 White House digital education initiative. The Obamas also plan to donate part of their advances to charity, including the Obama Foundation. â€œWe are absolutely thrilled to continue our publishing partnership with President and Mrs. Obama,â€ Markus Dohle, the chief executive of Penguin Random House, said in a statement. â€œWith their words and their leadership, they changed the world, and every day, with the books we publish at Penguin Random House, we strive to do the same. Now, we are very much looking forward to working together with President and Mrs. Obama to make each of their books global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance. â€ The Obamasâ€™ advance is likely to exceed even the stratospheric figures that other recent presidents and first ladies have received. Former president Bill Clinton sold his memoir â€œMy Lifeâ€ for more than $10 million, and Hillary Clinton reportedly received an $8 million advance from Simon  Schuster for her memoir â€œLiving History. â€ George W. Bushâ€™s memoir â€œDecision Points,â€ became a hit, selling about two million copies and earning him an estimated $10 million. (Mr. Barnett, a   lawyer, has handled many of these lucrative deals and represents some of the capitalâ€™s most powerful players, including the Clintons Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura Bush Speaker Paul D. Ryan and former Vice President Dick Cheney.) It is unusual, however, for a former president and first lady to make a collective deal for their memoirs, and some publishing industry insiders said that early on the process, it appeared that the books were going to be auctioned separately. (It is possible, and perhaps likely, that the books will be published by different imprints in the Penguin Random House conglomerate, which could also help the company absorb the cost of a large advance, by sharing it between imprints.) Mr. Obama has a proven track record in publishing as an author of multiple best sellers. His three books  â€”   â€œDreams From My Father,â€ â€œThe Audacity of Hopeâ€ and â€œOf Thee I Singâ€  â€”   have sold more than four million copies. According to financial disclosures, he earned more than $10 million from those titles. Reviews have praised him as a gifted prose stylist. But a postpresidential memoir has even greater potential to be a critical and commercial hit. Mr. Obama kept a journal during his time in office, which suggests his memoir could include    moments that were captured as major events unfolded. A frank discussion of his time in the White House, and of issues like race relations in America, could reach an even wider audience, becoming a worldwide blockbuster. Penguin Random House, a global publishing house with more than 250 imprints, has worldwide rights to the books, which means the company can make a good deal of money overseas and in translation. For the Obamas, the books may be valuable beyond the   advances. The deal was announced, probably coincidentally but somewhat awkwardly, on the night that President Trump gave his first address before Congress. These books could provide a chance to reframe and highlight the former presidentâ€™s legacy, at a moment when a new Republican administration is making an effort to dismantle some of his signature legislation.", "output": "1.

The decision was voted 18-1 late on Wednesday by a special committee considering a constitutional amendment to extend maternity leave for mothers of premature babies. The single vote against the ban was cast by the only woman present during the session, Erika Kokay of the Workers Party, who called the decision a maneuver by the committee s pro-life Evangelical majority. Abortion is illegal in predominantly Catholic Brazil except when the pregnancy is the result of a rape or puts the mother s life at risk. In 2012, the Supreme Court authorized the abortion on fetuses with anencephaly. More than one million abortions are carried out at clandestine clinics each year in Brazil and thousands of women end up in hospital as a result of botched procedures, according to government estimates. But even the limited circumstances where abortions are legal have been targeted by a growing Evangelical caucus in Congress that has led to a conservative trend in lawmaking on social issues.  To defend abortion, like it or not, is a Satanic, diabolical and destructive act,  Evangelical Congressman Pastor Eurico told the committee, brandishing a replica of a 12-week-old fetus. The move to criminalize all cases of abortion would require  supermajorities, or two-thirds of the votes in both chambers of Congress, as it is part of a constitutional amendment.

And, because heâ€™s a patriot and an American, heâ€™s likely to say yes.â€ Hamm, 70, became one of Americaâ€™s wealthiest men during the U.S. oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade, tapping into controversial hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in North Dakotaâ€™s shale fields. Continental spokeswoman Kristin Thomas said, â€œThere has never been a conversationâ€ between Trump and Hamm about the position. She declined to speculate on how Hamm would respond if asked to take the job. People close to Hamm were mixed on the possibility. â€œI think Harold would be great in the (Energy Secretary) job. If the president calls, I think he would do it,â€ said Mike Cantrell, a former vice president of government affairs at Continental who remains close to Hamm. Another prominent U.S. oil and gas executive who knows Hamm and asked not to be named, however, said he doubted Hamm would be willing to leave Continental and may be more interested in having a strong say in who gets the job. Aside from Hamm and Cramer, Trumpâ€™s short list for energy secretary also includes venture capitalist Robert Grady, who served as associate director for Natural Resources, Energy and Science in President George H. W. Bushâ€™s Office of Management and Budget, according to Cramer and two other sources with knowledge of the situation. Grady did not respond to requests for comment.  If Hamm is nominated, the Oklahoman would be the first U.S. energy secretary drawn directly from the industry since the cabinet position was created in 1977, a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster Trumpâ€™s pro-drilling energy platform. Trump, a Republican who will take office on Jan. 20 and succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, is also working to fill other top administration jobs in the coming weeks. Hamm addressed the Republican convention in July, calling for expanded drilling and saying too much environmental regulation threatened to limit U.S. oil production and increase the countryâ€™s dependence on Middle East oil producers.  Past heads of the U.S. Department of Energy, which is charged with advancing U.S. energy security and technology, including nuclear weapons production and labs, have typically boasted a political or academic background. Dan Eberhart, a Texas oil investor and Republican party financier who has worked with Hamm and has had conversations with the Trump campaign, said, â€œI know Hamm is being seriously considered. And I know that he wants it.â€ A former Capitol Hill staffer who knows both Hamm and Cramer said he thought Trump would be wise to favor the North Dakota congressman, a self-described climate change skeptic who has a history of supporting the oil, gas and coal sectors. â€œBoth Hamm and Cramer would be fantastic choices, but I think Cramer brings more balance and stability,â€ he said, asking not to be named.  This is not the first time Hamm has been in contention for the job. The Republican Partyâ€™s presidential nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, vetted Hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind.

And thatâ€™s exactly what Donald Trump did in the New York primary Tuesday, winning 61 of 62 counties and all but one congressional district en route to scooping up 90 delegates.\n\nIn the end, Trumpâ€™s resounding victory may have been as vital to the tone of the race coverage as it was to his actual path to the Republican nomination. After a month of taking on water thanks to staff shake-ups, organizing failures and a big loss in Wisconsin, The Donald trounced his rivals in the media capital of the world.\n\nBut itâ€™s probably not enough as he tries to secure the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination before reaching the GOP convention in Cleveland. The most likely scenario will have Trump getting about 1,185 delegates. Hereâ€™s why.\n\nNew York marks a crucial geographic segue in the race, as the calendar turns away from the Ted Cruz-friendly interior and into Trumpâ€™s mid-Atlantic wheelhouse. With 156 bound delegates at stake next Tuesday, the test for Cruz and John Kasich will be how many they can pick off.\n\nYou can start by penciling in 39 delegates for Trump as the likely statewide winner in Delaware, Pennsylvania and Maryland. Exceeding the 50 percent mark in Connecticut would mean another 13 delegates who would otherwise be split among the field.\n\nAnd Trump can expect to win about half of Rhode Islandâ€™s 19 proportionally allotted delegates. The rest will be awarded to the respective winners of each congressional district.\n\nThe best delegate-poaching opportunity for Kasich comes in the affluent Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, where polls show Trump dead last behind Cruz. Winning three or four districts between the Beltway and the Connecticut Gold Coast would be a big success. The best news for Trump opponents is that the single biggest trove of delegates will be the 54 unbound Pennsylvanians elected independently of candidate affiliation or obligation. While many have pledged to support the winner of the state or their district, all would be in play in Cleveland, a wrinkle that complicates Trumpâ€™s path.\n\nTrump would be wise to maximize his April opportunities. Other than New Jersey on June 7, there are no more gimmes, and few opportunities to reap a disproportionate share of delegates even from those states Trump might win. The Mountain West has been inhospitable terrain. The Pacific Northwest states split their delegates proportionally. And even West Virginia, in the heart of Trumpâ€™s Appalachian sweet spot, has a delegate system so complicated that he may come away shortchanged.\n\nThe bellwether to watch will be Indiana. The criminally under-polled state holds promise both for Trump (open primary, blue-collar sensibilities) and his opponents (affluent Indianapolis suburbs for Kasich, grassroots conservatives and evangelicals for Cruz), and awards 30 at-large delegates to the statewide winner. If Cruz can reprise the Midwestern magic that carried him in Wisconsin, he can stop the Trump offensive in its tracks. Short of that, he and Kasich must peel away as many congressional districts as possible to prevent Trump from heading into June needing only a glorified chip shot to clinch.\n\nIn the end, the race will come down to California and its massive cache of 172 delegates in what will amount to 53 unpredictable mini-primaries across disparate terrain. Ninety delegates will be awarded in districts where President Obama received 60 percent or more of the vote. Two-thirds of those will be decided in seats where Mitt Romney won 30 percent or less, including eight bona fide â€œrotten boroughsâ€ where he couldnâ€™t even crack 20 percent.\n\nTrump can hardly expect a New York-style romp here, meaning he needs at least 1,100 delegates coming in.\n\nCruzâ€™s argument at an open convention will be stronger if he can claim more than 800 delegates while keeping the deficit to a minimum. The California endgame will hinge on what happens in Indiana. If Cruz can battle through the coming adversity for a Hoosier State victory, the odds are weâ€™re headed to Cleveland.\n\nBottom line: Even if Trump wins Indiana and staves off Kasich in the â€™burbs, heâ€™d probably end up just shy of what he needs â€” perhaps as close as 1,230 delegates. But itâ€™s more likely that Indiana proves tougher for him and leaves him closer to 1,185 delegates â€” putting all eyes on Cleveland.", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: The United Nations refugee agency said on Wednesday that 500 people may have died in the choppy waters of the Mediterranean last week, when a large boat packed with migrants from Africa and the Middle East capsized in an unknown location between Libya and Italy. If confirmed, it would be the worst humanitarian calamity in Europeâ€™s migrant crisis since more than 800 people died last April near Libyan shores as they tried to reach Italy. The agency based its findings on interviews with 41 survivors of the shipwreck, although it was not able to verify the episode independently. The migrants  â€”   23 Somalis, 11 Ethiopians, six Egyptians and a Sudanese  â€”   were picked up by a merchant ship near Greece on April 16 after days of drifting at sea. They were transferred to a migrant camp in Kalamata, a city on the Greek mainland. Their stories helped lift a cloud of confusion about the episode ever since rumors of the sinking emerged over the weekend. But they did not resolve the questions of where the ship went down or what the ultimate death toll may be. No national coast guards have reported finding the boat. If accurate, however, the testimonies suggest that human smugglers are operating as aggressively as ever on the Mediterranean route even as a recent European Union deal with Turkey has stemmed the flow across the Aegean Sea. And while there is no indication that Syrians and others who had been trying to reach Greece are now employing different routes, it is clear that Africans and others remain willing to risk everything to flee repression, poverty and war. A deal that went into effect on March 20 to deport migrants reaching Greece from Turkey has reduced the number of people coming over the Aegean, a perilous voyage that killed around 800 last year. But the policy appears to have prompted smugglers to return to previously abandoned dangerous routes through Libya to Italy  â€”   the same path used by the 800 migrants who drowned in an overloaded boat a year ago. According to the survivors in Kalamata, a similar situation unfolded late last week, although the exact date was not clear, said William Spindler, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Smugglers had arranged for a   mother ship to leave the Libyan coast and head toward Italy, loaded with â€œhundreds of people in terribly overcrowded conditions. â€ Soon afterward, a second boat about 30 yards long set off from near Tobruk, Libya, with between 100 and 200 people aboard. After several hours, it neared the larger ship, which was waiting somewhere off shore. The smugglers began unloading migrants from the smaller boat onto the larger ship, the survivors told United Nations workers. As people boarded the big boat, it began to list. Then it capsized, spilling passengers into the sea, where most of them drowned amid a panicked frenzy. The survivors included people who had not yet left the smaller vessel, and a handful who managed to swim to it as the larger ship went down. â€œI could see the bigger boat sinking,â€ Liban Qadar Jama, a native of Somaliland, was quoted as telling the Voice of Americaâ€™s Somali Service this week. â€œWe ran with the small boat we were in, as some migrants from the sunk boat desperately swam toward us. We could only save four of them,â€ he told the V. O. A. In a statement, the refugee agency called for â€œincreased regular pathways for the admission of refugees and asylum seekers to Europeâ€ to â€œreduce the demand for   and dangerous irregular sea journeys. â€ Reports of the sinking emerged over the weekend on Facebook and social media from Somalia. Somaliaâ€™s ambassador to Egypt then told BBC Arabic, based on the social media reports, that more than 400 migrants were thought to have drowned. Yet as the stories began to circulate, no one seemed to be able to confirm what had happened, and conflicting narratives have emerged about whether the mass sinking had occurred at all. Social media posts referred to migrant boats running from Egypt to Italy as being caught up in the disaster, although the United Nations said survivors did not confirm that in their accounts. The Somali government issued a statement on Monday stating that 200 to 300 Somalis, including numerous teenagers, appeared to have drowned. But the Greek Coast Guard and the Italian and Maltese rescue authorities denied knowledge of the episode. The International Organization for Migration said on Monday that it could not confirm any news of any deaths or shipwrecks, and the Egyptian Coast Guard and Interior Ministry, which is in charge of the police, said they had heard the news from the media and had no knowledge of any boats leaving Alexandria recently. â€œThere is so much pressure. You have a boat rescuing people in Libya, a boat arriving elsewhere and another sinking in Greece,â€ said Muhammad Al Kashef, an Egyptian activist working with refugees and migrants in Alexandria. â€œIt just makes it very hard to document things. â€ In fact, after nearly 13 hours of calls to Somali activists and community leaders in and out of Egypt, Mr. Kashef said what he was able to ascertain was only that â€œan unspecified number of people have drowned somewhere near Greece having left from Egyptâ€ Monday morning. â€œThey told me they received calls from the survivors of Mondayâ€™s shipwreck in Greece saying their relatives died,â€ he added. As the rumors spread, European officials rushed to make statements. President Sergio Mattarella of Italy said in Rome on Monday that Europe was looking at â€œyet another tragedy in the Mediterranean in which, it seems, several hundred people have died. â€", "output": "1.

On Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump (@realDonaldTrump) tweeted â€œShould I do the #GOPdebate?â€ with a Twitter poll and a link to an Instagram video of himself complaining about Kelly of Fox News, which is owned by Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O). She is expected to moderate the Thursday debate.  â€œMegyn Kellyâ€™s really biased against me,â€ Trump said in the video. â€œShe knows that, I know that, everybody knows that. Do you really think she can be fair at a debate?â€ That same video garnered more than 190,000 views on Facebook in roughly an hour. The poll, which was embedded in Trumpâ€™s tweet, showed a near-split between respondents who felt he should attend the debate (52 percent) and those who felt he should skip it (48 percent). Overall, the poll had received more than 11,000 responses in the first two hours after it went live. Fox News appeared unfazed by Trumpâ€™s comments. â€œWe learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president,â€ a spokesperson for Fox News said. â€œA nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings.â€ Trump accused Kelly last August of asking him tougher questions than other candidates during a debate. His comments drew outcry, with some accusing the business tycoon of sexism. Trumpâ€™s bravado led some on social media to compare the Republican candidate to a pro wrestler psyching out his competition before a big match. â€œNot a chance he or she wonâ€™t show,â€ author Harlan Coben (@HarlanCoben) tweeted Tuesday, in reference to both Trump and Kelly. â€œThis is straight out of pro wrestling hype handbook.â€ â€œI always think Donald Trump reminds me of a WWE character,â€ tweeted Rob E\\m/ (@harvesterofsoro), â€œthen I remember he actually was.â€ The WWE website lists Trump as a 2013 WWE Hall of Fame Inductee. WWE Chairman and CEO Vince McMahon is one of just 49 people Trump follows on Twitter. Trump leads a crowded field of Republican candidates vying to represent the party in the November election.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: There may be no such thing as an ideal neighborhood for single people, but even in this age of dating apps and websites, neighborhood continues to play a huge role in how, and whom, people choose to date. Whether one is striking up a conversation at a coffee shop or tallying up proximity points with a potential love interest, geography matters in large ways and small. Not fretting about an hourlong postdate commute allows drinks to turn into dinner, for instance. A bar filled with friends may bestow the confidence to initiate a conversation with a stranger, which in turn may lead to the confidence to approach some other stranger, at some other bar, on some other night. In a city as diverse as New York, a neighborhood where dating happens naturally can be difficult to find. And statistics may, like a pickup line, mislead. Dorothy Castillo found the prospect of moving to Manhattan enticing for any number of reasons. Not least of all because she assumed the cityâ€™s dating scene would be far superior to that of suburban Rockland County, N. Y. where sheâ€™d spent most of her life. â€œI thought, â€˜This is going to be my golden ticket! Iâ€™m going to date all the time!â€™ â€ recalled Ms. Castillo, 27, a   teacher who bought a studio apartment in Washington Heights two and a half years ago. â€œI was truly and honestly  â€”   I donâ€™t know if this is naÃ¯ve  â€”   but I was hoping to meet someone at the grocery store or walking down the street,â€ she said. Instead, meeting people in person was â€œnear impossible,â€ she added. â€œAnd I consider myself a social person. â€ Though not opposed to online dating, she felt out of place in   Washington Heights and found her forays to Midtown and Lower East Side bars disappointing, the men standoffish. Then one day, a friend texted her to come to happy hour at Rambling House, an Irish pub in the Woodlawn neighborhood of the Bronx. â€œThe vibe was great  â€”   everyone was ready to have a good time and tell you their story,â€ she recalled. â€œI texted my mom and said, â€˜I want to move to Woodlawn.â€™ Within a few weeks I was in a Realtorâ€™s office. â€ Last May, she did indeed move there, to a     she bought. And Woodlawn, a neighborhood filled with   and   houses as well as some brick apartment buildings, has proved unexpectedly welcoming to Ms. Castillo. â€œI love it here,â€ Ms. Castillo said. â€œThere are a lot of young people here because itâ€™s a fun place to live. Iâ€™d like to meet someone not in a bar, but Iâ€™m just enjoying my 20s, going on some crazy dates. â€ In a similarly surprising corollary, a neighborhood with a high percentage of single people doesnâ€™t necessarily translate into a good singles neighborhood. Between 2010 and 2014, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, had a 36 percent increase in the number of single men (single being defined as a person aged 20 to 34 who has never been married) to 15, 121 from 11, 127, and a 31 percent increase in single women, to 12, 272 from 9, 361  â€”   one of the largest increases in the city, according to the census bureauâ€™s American Community Survey. Based on that data, the New York City Economic Development Corporation declared the neighborhood â€œan attractive spot for all young singlesâ€ in 2014. Not everyone agrees. The area â€œis not such a good spot for single people,â€ said Mirsad Kadribasic, 41, an owner of La BohÃ¨me Lounge on Stillwell Avenue in Bensonhurst, which on a recent Friday night was   with couples smoking hookahs at velvet banquettes. â€œIâ€™m a single person myself and I canâ€™t meet anyone here. â€œItâ€™s a   neighborhood. People go to work, go home, go to sleep. When people want to go out, they go elsewhere. Itâ€™s not like Park Slope, where people are hanging out all the time. â€ Though it may be the envy of Bensonhurst, the Park Slope dating scene did not impress Robert DiBiase when he moved there from Washington, D. C. several years ago. The neighborhood had plenty of bars, conceded Mr. DiBiase, 42, an associate broker at Halstead Property, â€œbut they were small and filled with locals, not people coming from Manhattan to hang out. â€ The local bars were places where neighbors went to grab a beer and catch up, he said, not places to meet a potential mate. When his aging bulldog compelled him to trade his   for an elevator building, he seized on the opportunity and rented a   on the Lower East Side, a quick walk to local favorites like Stanton Social or Mr. Purple, the rooftop bar at the Hotel Indigo. Now he wonâ€™t date anyone who lives in Brooklyn. Or Queens. Or the Upper East Side, for that matter. He prefers to stay within blocks of home. â€œThatâ€™s what apps are for,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™m so used to convenience living in New York. I donâ€™t want an     obstacle just to grab a coffee. I donâ€™t want to end up coming back at midnight on some train that stalls in the station because of an investigation. â€ Nancy Slotnick, a dating coach, said that proximity was crucial for many single New Yorkers. â€œThe first date is going to happen so much more easily if youâ€™re in the same neighborhood,â€ she said. And for those hoping to meet in what her clients often refer to as â€œthe natural way,â€ neighborhood can make all the difference, she said. Certainly, it did for her. One evening, she saw an attractive man at an event on the Upper West Side, where she lived, but she was too shy to approach. Afterward, she was standing on the sidewalk and he walked by again. Loath to let another opportunity pass, she caught his eye, smiled and struck up a conversation. She later found out that he had come into the cafe where she was an owner just the day before. He is now her husband. â€œFate gave us another chance!â€ she said. â€œI know this sounds hokey, but you get a chance to cross paths with people and you often miss it,â€ she said. â€œWhen youâ€™re in the same neighborhood you get that chance over and over again. â€ But Michael J. Rosenfeld, a Stanford University sociology professor who researches how couples meet, said that meeting in the neighborhood, along with meeting through family, friends,   school and church, had declined since the 1990s, largely because of the rise of online dating. â€œNeighborhood still matters in lots of ways, at least for people who have a choice of where they live, which is not everybody,â€ he said. â€œBut the ability to find single people to date in the neighborhood matters less than it used to. â€ Natasha Zamor, 28, a paralegal who lives in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, said that her neighborhood played almost no role in her dating life. While she enjoys going out with friends to bars by the Barclays Center  â€”   333 Lounge on Flatbush Avenue is a favorite  â€”   thereâ€™s nothing to tell you if the person you meet at a bar is someone â€œyou want to invest your time in. â€ Ms. Zamorâ€™s mother, a nurse, and father, a psychiatrist, emphasized the importance of marrying a man whose education and aspirations were similar to her own. She likes that on dating apps like SoulSwipe, Tinder and Plenty of Fish you can easily find out where someone went to school, what he does for work, and where he lives  â€”   which she views as important indicators of compatibility. She says she dates â€œthroughout the metro area. â€ â€œI want someone I can communicate with and bring into my circle of friends. Someone who can be equal or better,â€ Ms. Zamor said, adding that, â€œunfortunately, this seems to create a standard that can never ever be met. â€ Tara Atwood, 33, lived in Manhattan for 10 years after college, first on the Upper East Side, then in Midtown East. She worked in finance and dated â€œmeatheads who wore baggy jeans ripped at the bottom and didnâ€™t want to do anything but drink beer and watch football. â€ After ending a   relationship with one such meathead, she left her job to go to business school and moved to 1 North Fourth, a luxury rental on the waterfront in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which suits her perfectly. â€œItâ€™s full of people who are  : creative,   educated, curious,â€ she said. â€œI would say 75 percent of the people are people youâ€™d swipe right on. Living here has literally been like a live dating app. â€ She and friends from the building have traveled to Tulum, Mexico, participated in a coed fantasy football league, gone on daylong bike trips and sweated through SoulCycle classes together. In Manhattan, she said, the men she met through apps would boast about being a top person at a place like Oracle, the   company. â€œNow Iâ€™m into the kind of guy with facial hair who wears a leather bracelet and goes salsa dancing,â€ she said. While finding oneâ€™s tribe may be the underpinning of dating success, certain factors make it more likely to happen in some places than others. Neighborhoods popular with singles tend to have comparatively affordable housing, convenience to transportation and a good assortment of bars and restaurants  â€”   think Astoria in Queens and Murray Hill and the East Village in Manhattan. Charles Conroy, a salesman for Citi Habitats, said that for his   clients who want to walk out the door into night life, he usually recommends the East Village. He recently found an apartment on Second Avenue and 10th Street for three men in their early 20s, one of whom broke up with his girlfriend so he could move in with his friends and â€œextend the college experience before moving in with girlfriends down the road. â€ â€œHis dating life has skyrocketed,â€ Mr. Conroy said. â€œHe sends me texts all the time. â€ Elie Seidman, the chief executive of OkCupid, an online dating site, said that while he believes that moving to New York might improve a personâ€™s romantic odds, he didnâ€™t believe there was â€œa magic neighborhood cure. â€ Census data shows that neighborhoods with high concentrations of single women donâ€™t often match up with those that have a lot of single men. The New York neighborhoods with the highest ratio of single women to single men, ages 20 to 34, are the Upper East Side (0. 6 men to every woman) Murray Hill (0. 68) the Upper West Side (0. 79) and Brownsville, Brooklyn (0. 8) according to 2014 data from the American Community Survey compiled by the cityâ€™s Economic Development Corporation. Neighborhoods with the highest percentages of single men tend to be immigrant communities, according to a researcher at the development corporation  â€”     Corona, Queens has the best odds for women in the city, with 1. 57 men to every woman Jackson   Corona is a close second at 1. 54 men to every woman. Not all of those men are looking for women  â€”   Jackson Heights has grown increasingly popular with gay men. The Upper West Side, some say, is the place to be if youâ€™re a single Modern Orthodox Jew. â€œReally the only other place in the world as good for dating is Jerusalem,â€ said Curtis Goldstein, a salesman at Halstead. Newcomers quickly find themselves overwhelmed with invitations for Friday night Shabbat dinners, and synagogues vie to be the center of the scene, luring singles with snacks like kosher sushi and meatballs. â€œIâ€™m a social butterfly, so I love it,â€ said Jessica Schechter, 29, an actress, director, producer and teacher who moved to the neighborhood in 2011. When sheâ€™s not dating someone, she said, she attends at least one neighborhood singles event a week. The dating scene is so frenetic, some people weary of it, including those who fail to meet someone despite what would appear to be every conceivable opportunity. â€œIt can be hard, it can be draining. My roommate jokes about JOMO  â€”   the joy of missing out,â€ Ms. Schechter said. But the ceaseless courtship ritual has provided fodder for â€œSoon by You,â€ a web series she produces and acts in about dating in the community. For those who tire of the West Side, she added, thereâ€™s the smaller dating scene on the East Side. For some singles, less may be more. Dr. Carlos J. Huerta, 40, a dentist, moved to Hellâ€™s Kitchen recently after nine years in the East Village. He left an apartment share to be closer to his   his friends and the practice he had just started. When he and his boyfriend broke up a short time later, he found himself single in the center of one of the cityâ€™s most vibrant gay dating scenes. â€œI loved the East Village. It felt serendipitous, like you could meet people from different walks of life,â€ Dr. Huerta said. â€œHellâ€™s Kitchen is so concentrated with eligible men,â€ he said. â€œHow do you pick and choose?â€ He said he was glad that his rental building, Gotham West, is on 11th Avenue, because it affords some distance from the scene. Even so, heâ€™s thinking about moving back downtown. â€œItâ€™d just be nice to have to think about it a little less, to live in less of a concentrated dating pool,â€ he said. â€œTo meet someone in more of a chance encounter. â€", "output": "1.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: The last time Steve Kerr was in Beirut, his birthplace, with the bombs pounding the runway and the assassination of his father six months away, he left by car. The airport was closed. There was talk of taking a cruise ship to Cyprus, or accompanying an ambassador on a helicopter to Tel Aviv or even crossing into Israel on a bus. A military plane headed to Cairo had an empty seat, but it went to someone else. Finally, a hired driver took Kerr over the Lebanon Mountains and across the Syrian border to Damascus, then on to Amman, Jordan. It felt like an escape. â€œIâ€™m fearful that all this uncertainty and inconvenience, not to mention even a sense of physical danger, has not done Steveâ€™s image of Beirut much good, and in his present mood he wonders what any of us are doing here,â€ his father, Malcolm H. Kerr, the president of the American University of Beirut, wrote to other family members that day in August 1983. A few months later, Malcolm Kerr was shot twice in the back of the head outside his university office. Steve Kerr was 18 then, quiet and  . He was a lightly recruited freshman at the University of Arizona, before it was a basketball power. It took a vivid imagination to see him becoming an N. B. A. champion as a player and a coach, now leading the Golden State Warriors. But perhaps it should be no surprise that, at 51, Kerr has found his voice in public discourse, talking about much more than basketball: heavy topics like gun control,   protests, presidential politics and Middle East policy. With an educated and evenhanded approach, he steps into discussions that most others in his position purposely avoid or know little about, chewing through the gray areas in a world that increasingly paints itself in bold contrasts. In many ways, he has grown into an echo of his father. â€œThe truly civilized man is marked by empathy,â€ Malcolm Kerr wrote in a foreword to a collection of essays called â€œThe   Confrontation of June 1967: An Arab Perspective. â€ â€œBy his recognition that the thought and understanding of men of other cultures may differ sharply from his own, that what seems natural to him may appear grotesque to others. â€ In a rare and sometimes emotional interview this fall, Kerr spoke about the death of his father and his familyâ€™s deep roots in Lebanon and the Middle East. Some of the words sounded familiar. â€œPut yourself in someone elseâ€™s shoes and look at it from a bigger perspective,â€ he said. â€œWe live in this complex world of gray areas. Life is so much easier if it could be black and white, good and evil. â€ Providing commentary on the state of todayâ€™s politics and culture is not a prerequisite for Kerrâ€™s job. There are sports fans, maybe the majority of them, who wish athletes and coaches would keep their nonsports opinions to themselves  â€”   stand for the anthem, be thankful for your good fortune, express only humility, and provide little but smiles and autographs. Kerr understands that. Sports are a diversion for most who follow them, â€œonly meaningful to us and our fans,â€ he said. In a sports world that takes itself too seriously, that perspective is part of the appeal of Kerr and the Warriors. They won the 2015 N. B. A. championship, were   last season and remain a top team this season. They seem to be having more fun than anyone else. But Kerr also knows that sports are an active ingredient of American culture. He knows, as well as anyone, that players are complicated, molded by background, race, religion and circumstance. And Kerr is, too: a man whose grandparents left the United States to work in the Middle East, whose father was raised there, whose mother adopted it, whose family has a different and broader perspective than most. The Kerrs are a family touched by terrorism in the most personal way. Malcolm Kerr was not a random victim. He was a target. That gives Steve Kerr a voice. His job gives him a platform. You will excuse him if he has a few things to say. â€œItâ€™s really simple to demonize Muslims because of our anger over   but itâ€™s obviously so much more complex than that,â€ he said. â€œThe vast majority of Muslims are   people, just like the vast majority of Christians and Buddhists and Jews and any other religion. People are people. â€ He delved into modern Middle East history, about World War II and the Holocaust and the 1948 creation of Israel, about the   War in 1967, about peace accords and the   conflict and the Iraq War and the United Statesâ€™ scattered chase for whatever shifting   it has at any particular time. â€œMy dad would have been able to explain it all to me,â€ Kerr said. Instead, he absorbed it as a boy and applies it as an adult. â€œHe at least gave me the understanding that itâ€™s complex. And as easy as it is to demonize people, thereâ€™s a lot of different factors involved in creating this culture that weâ€™re in now. â€ Malcolm Kerr was a professor at U. C. L. A. for 20 years, and the sprawling ranch house where the family lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif. has a flat driveway and a basketball hoop bolted to the roof above the garage. Steve Kerr spent countless hours in the driveway practicing the shot that would give him the N. B. A. record for career   percentage that still stands. But not all memories in the driveway are about basketball. â€œI remember when the Camp David accords happened,â€ Kerr said, recalling the 1978 peace talks between Menachem Begin of Israel and Anwar   of Egypt, shepherded by President Jimmy Carter. Kerr had just entered his teens. â€œOne of my best friends was a guy named David Zuckerman, a Jewish guy, and his father was an English professor,â€ Kerr said. â€œMr. Zuckerman and David drove me home from baseball practice or something, and we pull up in the driveway and my dad sees us and comes running out. Mr. Zuckermanâ€™s name was Marvin, and my dad said: â€˜Marvin, Marvin! Did you see the picture today of Begin and Sadat?â€™ It was the biggest thing. It would have been the equivalent of the Dodgers winning the World Series. He was so excited for that moment because that is what he really hoped for: Middle East peace. That was his dream. That day, Iâ€™ll never forget it. â€ Kerr paused. â€œAnd then it was only a short time later that Sadat was killed,â€ he said. The Sadat assassination was in October 1981, just 27 months before Malcolm Kerr was killed. Malcolm Kerrâ€™s parents, Stanley and Elsa Kerr, were American missionaries who met in the Middle East after World War I. He worked for American Near East Relief in Turkey during the slaughter of countless Armenians (detailed later in his memoir, â€œThe Lions of Marashâ€). She had traveled to Istanbul to study Turkish and to teach. They married in 1921 and moved to Lebanon to run orphanages. They went on to teach at the American University of Beirut for 40 years. Malcolm was one of their four children. He went to the United States for prep school and graduated from Princeton before he returned to A. U. B. for graduate school. It was there that he met Ann Zwicker, an Occidental College student from California spending a year studying abroad. Beirut was a cosmopolitan,   city on the Mediterranean, a mix of Christians and Muslims seemingly in balance, if not harmony. A. U. B. was founded in 1866 (it celebrated its 150th anniversary on Dec. 3) as a bastion of free thought and diversity, welcoming all races and religions. As wars and crises suffocated the Middle East in recent decades, it has often felt like an island, protected by prestige and  . Malcolm and Ann married and raised four children: Susan, John, Steve and Andrew. The first three were born in Beirut. Malcolm Kerr took a teaching job at A. U. B. but the Kerrs settled in California when Steve was a toddler. Malcolm Kerrâ€™s tenure at U. C. L. A. was sprinkled with sojourns and sabbaticals that persistently pulled the family back to the Middle East. Steve Kerr spent two separate school years in Cairo. There were summers in Beirut and Tunisia, another year in France, and road trips circling the Mediterranean in a Volkswagen van. Steve â€œwas not always thrilled,â€ he admitted, to leave friends and the comfort of California. He hated to miss sports camps and football and basketball games at U. C. L. A. where the Kerrs had season tickets. In hindsight, though, his familyâ€™s long history in the Middle East, beginning nearly 100 years ago, shaped him in ways that he only now realizes. â€œItâ€™s an American story, something Iâ€™m very proud of, the work that my grandparents did,â€ Kerr said. â€œIt just seemed like a time when Americans were really helping around the world, and one of the reasons we were beloved was the amount of help we provided, whether it was after World War I, like my grandparents, or World War II. Iâ€™m sort of nostalgic for that sort of perception. We were the good guys. I felt it growing up, when I was living in Egypt, when I was overseas. Americans were revered in much of the Middle East. And itâ€™s just so sad what has happened to us the last few decades. â€ Kerr was in high school when his father was named president of A. U. B. in 1982. It was Malcolm Kerrâ€™s dream job. But the appointment came as Lebanon was embroiled in civil war. Yasir Arafatâ€™s Palestine Liberation Organization, expelled from Syria, had its headquarters in Beirut. Iranian Shiites, followers of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, had moved into Lebanon and given voice to the impoverished Shiite minority there. The Christian population was shrinking, and Lebanon was in the middle of a tug of war between Israel and Syria. â€œI bet thereâ€™s a   chance Iâ€™ll get bumped off early on,â€ Malcolm Kerr told his daughter, Susan, in March 1982, she recalled in her memoir, â€œOne Familyâ€™s Response to Terrorism. â€ He accepted the job the next morning. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and the countermove by the Iranians to send its Iranian Revolutionary Guards there through Syria, began in June 1982, weeks before Malcolm Kerr was to start the new job. In the chaos,   militants were organizing and would eventually become Hezbollah. Malcolm Kerr was kept in New York until things settled, but A. U. B. â€™s acting president, David Dodge, was kidnapped in July, and A. U. B. was in need of leadership. Malcolm Kerr arrived in August, expressing hope that the destruction and death closing in on the campus could be kept outside its walls. (Dodge, who was released by his captors after a year, died in 2009.) Back in California, Steve began his senior year and starred on the basketball team. â€œI wanted him to be at games, but I knew that he was doing what he loved,â€ Kerr said. â€œAnd when youâ€™re 16 or 17, youâ€™re so  . You just want to play and do your thing. â€ Malcolm Kerr wrote letters home almost daily. They detailed tense meetings with political leaders, the latest assaults on Beirut, the assassination in September 1982 of the Lebanese   Bashir Gemayel, the interviews with foreign journalists. Most were filled with optimism and good humor. â€œThe thought of being in Pacific Palisades for Christmas is more appealing than I can say, and I wouldnâ€™t miss the chance for anything,â€ he wrote in one. â€œHopefully Iâ€™ll get there in time to catch a few of Steveâ€™s basketball games and watch Andrew wash the cars. â€ That December, the Kerrs posed at their California house wearing matching A. U. B. sweatshirts. Steve Kerr went with his mother and brother Andrew to Beirut in the summer of 1983, before he went to play at Arizona for   coach Lute Olson. A few months before, militants had bombed the United States embassy in Beirut, killing 63, including 17 Americans. But the visit fell during what felt like a lull in the war. â€œWe went hiking in the mountains above Beirut and swimming in the Mediterranean,â€ Kerr said. â€œThe house where they lived was on campus  â€”   the presidential house, the Marquand House. It was beautiful. It was surreal. There was a butler. We didnâ€™t have that back home. But now he was living the life of the president. We had a great time during the day, and then we played cards after dinner outside. â€ The trick was leaving. Ann Kerr went with Steve to the airport in August. â€œThere was some question about whether flights would be going out because of everything that was happening,â€ Kerr said. â€œWe were in the terminal, and all of a sudden there was a blast. It wasnâ€™t in the terminal but on the runways. The whole place just froze. Everybody just froze. People started gathering, saying, â€˜Weâ€™ve got to get the hell out of here.â€™ My mom grabbed me, and I remember running out of the terminal and through the parking lot. It was really scary. I remember thinking, â€˜This is real. â€™â€ The Kerrs pondered options for getting Steve out. They learned that a private plane of diplomats was going to the United States Marine base and there might be an available seat on the flight back out. Steve spent hours waiting, talking to Marines. In the end, there were no seats. The Kerrs eventually made arrangements for a university driver to take Steve over the mountains, through Syria to Jordan. (The driver, a longtime friend of the family, was killed by a sniper in Beirut in 1985.) On an early morning in October 1983, a truck bomb destroyed the   Marine barracks. Among the dead were 220 Marines and 21 other service members. â€œI remember looking at all the photos afterward,â€ Kerr said. He started to cry. â€œI see all these, the nicest people, who I met and they were showing us around the base and just trying to do their jobs and keep the peace. And a truck bomb?â€ Kerr said he recognized some of the faces of the dead. â€œThere is a chaplain who had come over and kind of taken us under his wing,â€ he said. â€œThe nicest guy. And I saw his face. . .. â€ Kerr wiped his eyes and took a deep breath. â€œWhat has it been, 30 years? And it still brings me to tears. â€ In December, John visited his parents in Beirut. They had a videotape of Steveâ€™s first game for Arizona a couple of weeks before. The picture was fuzzy, shot without sound from a camera high in the gym, and they could not always tell which player was Steve. It did not matter. â€œI think he scored three baskets, and we must have watched each of them 10 times, rewinding the tape over and over again just to relish every detail,â€ John wrote in an entry for a family scrapbook made on an anniversary of Malcolm Kerrâ€™s death. He called it â€œDadâ€™s and my high point as sports fans. â€ In the middle of a night in January 1984, Kerr got a call in his dorm room from Vahe Simonian, a family friend and a vice president at A. U. B. who was based in New York. Simonian told Kerr that his father had been killed. The assassination on Jan. 18, 1984, was international news, including on the front page of The New York Times. Malcolm Kerr, 52, had stepped off the elevator toward his office in College Hall and was shot in the back of the head. The two unknown assailants escaped. A group calling itself Islamic Holy War took responsibility later that day. â€œDr. Kerr was a modest and extremely popular figure among his 4, 800 students and faculty, according to his colleagues here,â€ Times reporter Thomas L. Friedman wrote from Beirut that day. â€œHe was killed, his friends insist, not for being who he was, but because now that the Marines and the American Embassy in Beirut are smothered in security, he was the most vulnerable prominent American in Lebanon and a choice target for militants trying to intimidate Americans into leaving. â€ Andrew Kerr, who was 15 at the time, heard about his fatherâ€™s death on a radio in a shop near A. U. B. â€™s campus. Ann Kerr learned about it while waiting at a campus guardhouse, out of the rain, for a friend. She ran to College Hall, to the second floor, where she found her husband â€œlying on the floor, face down, his briefcase and umbrella in front of him,â€ she wrote in her memoir, â€œCome With Me From Lebanon. â€ A memorial service was held a few days later. John came from Cairo and Susan came from Taiwan. Steve was the only one of the children who did not attend. He missed another one at Princeton, but attended a third in Los Angeles. â€œIt sounds bad,â€ he said. â€œObviously, the basketball wasnâ€™t more important. But the logistics were really tricky. And it was cathartic for me to just play. â€ He had a breakout game in a victory over rival Arizona State two nights after his fatherâ€™s death. The Wildcats had been   but won eight of their final 14 games. The next year, they reached the N. C. A. A. tournament on their way to becoming a lasting national power. Four years later, Kerr was the target of pregame taunts at Arizona State. A group of students shouted, â€œP. L. O. P. L. O. ,â€ â€œYour fatherâ€™s history,â€ and â€œWhy donâ€™t you join the Marines and go back to Beirut?â€ â€œWhen I heard it, I just dropped the ball and started shaking,â€ Kerr said at the time. â€œI sat down for a minute. Iâ€™ll admit they got to me. I had tears in my eyes. For one thing, it brought back memories of my dad. But, for another thing, it was just sad that people would do something like that. â€ Ann   is 82, wears Keds and keeps her hair in a   bob. She is the longtime coordinator of the Fulbright program at U. C. L. A. and oversees a class called â€œPerceptions of the United States Abroad. â€ She is also an emeritus trustee at A. U. B. and usually goes back to Beirut once a year for meetings. She remarried in 2008. She and Ken Adams share the California house that she and Malcolm bought in 1969. The stately living room, with a grand piano and views of the Pacific Ocean, is neatly decorated with treasures of a   life, like etchings of Cairo and Annâ€™s framed watercolors of Tunisia. The mantel has an   photograph of Steve and Andrew in a field of flowers in Morocco. â€œI would say Steveâ€™s intellectual interests really blossomed in the last 10 years,â€ she said. â€œBut I donâ€™t think of Steve being like Malcolm. â€ They shared a passion for sports (the childrenâ€™s    limit for television did not apply to sports) and an irreverent sense of humor. But Steve is more diplomatic than his father, she said. A nearby guest room was where the three Kerr boys slept. The bunk beds that Steve and Andrew shared are gone, but there is a painting that Steve did as a boy  â€”   a   of him in a U. C. L. A. shirt and a Dodgers cap, his blond hair hanging past his ears. The bathroom has a painting of poinsettias he did when he was 9, and a closet contains his screen prints of boats in Cairo. â€œHereâ€™s a picture of Steve, the ornery teenager,â€   said on a recent Sunday afternoon, stopping in a hallway lined with family photographs. â€œHe was always snarling in pictures. Now he has to smile for photos. The irony of it all. â€ Across the hall is the room that Malcolm used as an office. His children harbor happy memories of the sound of his typewriter clacking and the smell of the popcorn that he liked as a snack. The backyard, with wide ocean views that test the flexibility of the human neck  â€”   from Los Angeles on the left, to the Santa Monica Mountains on the right  â€”   features a broad patio. On Sunday afternoons, it was frequently filled with professors, neighbors, visiting dignitaries and friends from around the world. It was the familyâ€™s connection to the Middle East that made his childhood unique. â€œIt would be totally different without that,â€ Kerr said. â€œTotally different. I wouldnâ€™t be exposed to not only the travel and the interaction with people, but I wouldnâ€™t be exposed to the political conversations at the table and at barbecues about what was going on in the world. â€ But talk around the house was more likely to involve the Dodgers or Bruins. Malcolm was a good athlete, a basketball player growing up and an avid tennis player until the end. He and Steve spent a lot of time at the high school hitting and fielding, and Malcolm sometimes joined Steve in the driveway. â€œHe was a lefty and had a nice hook shot,â€ Kerr said with a laugh. Kerr credits his father for his demeanor on the sideline as an N. B. A. coach: calm and quiet, mostly, and never one to berate a player. Kerr was not always that way. â€œWhen I was 8, 9, 10 years old, I had a horrible temper,â€ Kerr said. â€œI couldnâ€™t control it. Everything I did, if I missed a shot, if I made an out, I got so angry. It was embarrassing. It really was. Baseball was the worst. If I was pitching and I walked somebody, I would throw my glove on the ground. I was such a brat. He and my mom would be in the stands watching, and he never really said anything until we got home. He had the sense that I needed to learn on my own, and anything he would say would mean more after I calmed down. â€ His father, Kerr said, was what every Little League parent should be. The talks would come later, casual and nonchalant, conversations instead of lectures. â€œHe was an observer,â€ he said. â€œAnd he let me learn and experience. I try to give our guys a lot of space and speak at the right time. Looking back on it, I think my dad was a huge influence on me, on my coaching. â€ Kerr played for some of the best basketball coaches in history  â€”   Olson at Arizona, Phil Jackson with the Chicago Bulls and Gregg Popovich with the San Antonio Spurs among them. By the standards of basketball coaches, they were worldly men with interests far beyond the court. â€œI remember Phil talking to the team about gun control, and asking the players: â€˜How many of you have guns? How many of you know that if you have a gun in your house youâ€™re more likely to have a fatality in your house? â€™â€ Kerr said. â€œIt was a real discussion, with guys saying that we need to have some level of protection, because we are vulnerable in many ways, too. â€œAnd I remember one presidential election, it was probably 2000, I was with the Spurs and we did two teams shooting  â€”   the silver team against the black team or whatever,â€ he said, referring to a drill run by Popovich. â€œPop was like, â€˜O. K. Democrats down there, Republicans down here.â€™ I think it was about 12 against two at that point, so he had to even up the teams a little bit. He would just make it interesting. â€ Kerr  â€”   who has three children, all young adults, with his wife, Margot  â€”   has never talked about his father in front of the team, and Warriors players have only a vague notion of Kerrâ€™s family history. It is context, mostly, an unstated part of his background. â€œI really realized from Pop and Phil that I could use my experience as a kid and growing up to my advantage as a coach,â€ Kerr said. â€œAnd connect with players and try to keep that healthy perspective. Keep it fun, and donâ€™t take it too seriously. â€ It was during Kerrâ€™s tenure with San Antonio that the family, after years of reflection following the 1996 passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, decided to sue Iran. The Kerrs came to believe that   Hezbollah had targeted Malcolm. â€œI didnâ€™t need revenge, I didnâ€™t need closure,â€ Steve Kerr said. â€œSo I was indifferent to the lawsuit. But then I recognized that it was important to a couple of members of my family, my sister and my younger brother, in particular. â€ When it came time to testify in United States District Court in Washington in December 2002, Kerr was with the Spurs, in the last of his 15 seasons in the N. B. A. He did not want to miss games. â€œThereâ€™s nobody better than Pop to talk about something like this,â€ Kerr said. â€œI told him, â€˜I donâ€™t really want people knowing what it is.â€™ I didnâ€™t want the attention. But I also donâ€™t want people thinking Iâ€™m injured. So Pop said: â€˜You missed two games for personal reasons. Big deal. Your reputation precedes you. Nobody is going to question whatâ€™s going on with you.â€™ And he was right. I told my teammates and nothing ever really came of it. â€ He testified in a nearly empty courtroom, missing two Spursâ€™ road games on the West Coast. The Kerrs learned two months later that they had won the suit  â€”   millions of dollars that they may never see. But money was never the point. â€œIt provides a structure to enable people to channel their feelings through justice and the rules of law, rather than become vigilantes,â€ his sister, who is now known as Susan van de Ven, said in a phone interview from England, where she is involved in politics as a county councillor. â€œIt gives a very focused approach to people who are rightly and insanely aggrieved. Thatâ€™s the kind of culture we should have. We shouldnâ€™t be responding with violence. Iâ€™m sure thatâ€™s why Steve talked about guns. Itâ€™s all related, isnâ€™t it?â€ Her book detailed the familyâ€™s experience with the lawsuit. The night before the Warriors visited President Obama to celebrate their 2015 N. B. A. championship, Steve had dinner with Andrew, who works for an architectural design and residential builder in Washington. They discussed what Steve might say to the president. Andrew recommended complimenting him on his efforts toward gun control. Kerr did. In June, at the end of a podcast with Bay Area sports columnist Tim Kawakami, Kerr asked if he could raise one more topic. Our government is â€œinsane,â€ he said, not to adopt stronger background checks on guns that most Americans agree upon. â€œAs somebody who has had a family member shot and killed, it just devastates me every time I read about this stuff, like what happened in Orlando,â€ Kerr said, referring to the June massacre at a Florida nightclub. â€œAnd then itâ€™s even more devastating to see the government just cowing to the N. R. A. and going to this totally outdated Bill of Rights, right to bear arms. If you want to own a musket, fine. But come on. â€ Since then, Kerr has become a   voice in sports for matters of bigger meaning. It surprises his family in some ways, knowing that he was probably the quietest of the siblings as a child. â€œHeâ€™s carrying around the family business in another discipline,â€ said John Kerr, a professor of community sustainability at Michigan State. â€œThere was no way he would do anything for a living that didnâ€™t involve sports. No way. And now that heâ€™s at the pro level, he has the opportunity to speak out. Heâ€™s smart enough to realize he can do it. â€ N. B. A. training camps began just as debate swirled over the decision by Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, not to stand for the national anthem, a protest over the killing of unarmed black men by police officers. Amid the divisiveness, Kerr was a nuanced voice in the middle. â€œDoesnâ€™t matter what side youâ€™re on on the Kaepernick stuff, you better be disgusted with the things that are happening,â€ Kerr said. He added: â€œI understand people who are offended by his stance. Maybe they have a military family member or maybe they lost someone in a war and maybe that anthem means a lot more to them than someone else. But then you flip it around, and what about nonviolent protests? Thatâ€™s America. This is what our country is about. â€ In November, after the presidential election, Kerr was among the N. B. A. coaches, including Popovich, who criticized the state of political discourse in the age of Donald J. Trump. â€œPeople are getting paid millions of dollars to go on TV and scream at each other, whether itâ€™s in sports or politics or entertainment, and I guess it was only a matter of time before it spilled into politics,â€ Kerr said. â€œBut then all of a sudden youâ€™re faced with the reality that the man whoâ€™s going to lead you has routinely used racist, misogynist, insulting words. â€ It is no surprise, then, that Kerr also has opinions on the Middle East. Like his father decades ago, Kerr said he believes that American policies have muddied the region. The heart of the problem, he said, stems from the lack of a   solution for Israel and Palestine. The Iraq War made things worse. â€œTo use Colin Powellâ€™s line, â€˜If you break it, you own it,â€™ and now we own it,â€ Kerr said. â€œAnd itâ€™s, like, â€˜Oh, my God, wait, itâ€™s so much more complicated than we thought.â€™ Everybody looks back and thinks we would have been way better off not going to war. That was really dumb. But history repeats itself all the time. We didnâ€™t need to go into Vietnam, but circumstances, patriotism, anger, fear  â€”   all these things lead into war. Itâ€™s a history of the world. It just so happens that now is probably the scariest time since Iâ€™ve been alive. â€ In Beirut, A. U. B. still thrives. On its campus overlooking the Mediterranean is a new College Hall, a virtual replica of the one where Malcolm Kerr was killed, the building destroyed by bombs in 1991. There is the dignified Marquand House, where Malcolm Kerr lived when he was a young professor and returned to when he became president. In an oval garden between College Hall and the chapel, there is a banyan tree that Malcolm Kerr climbed as a boy and carved with his initials, now high out of sight. Under the tree is a Corinthian column that the family chose in the days after his death to mark the spot where his ashes were buried. â€œIn memory of Malcolm H. Kerr, â€ the engraving reads. â€œHe lived life abundantly. â€ Those were the words that Susan wrote on a piece of paper that marked the site until the stone was etched. The paper is still there, on a plaque that also features an excerpt from  â€™s book. â€œWe are proud that our dad and husband came to A. U. B. ,â€ Susan wrote, in words that are now faded with time. Steve Kerr has never seen it. He has not been back since his father was killed. But, more and more, he hears the echoes.", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Illinois Republican Governor Bruce Rauner on Wednesday called on Democrats who control the legislature to give him the power to balance the stateâ€™s chronically unbalanced budget if they continue to reject his proposed reform package. In his second budget address to the legislature, Rauner said residents were â€œsick and tiredâ€ of a political impasse that has left the fifth-largest U.S. state without a full budget for nearly eight months. Illinois and Pennsylvania are the only two states that lack complete fiscal 2016 budgets.  Rauner, a wealthy venture capitalist turned politician, offered two fiscal 2017 budget proposals: a $36.3 billion general fund spending plan that incorporates his so-called turnaround agenda that Democrats have opposed, or a budget tied to proposed legislation to empower him to reduce spending to $32.8 billion. â€œI wonâ€™t support new revenue unless we have major structural reforms to grow more jobs and get more value for taxpayers,â€ he said. Rauner insisted any fiscal 2016 budget deal must include Democratic concessions on at least â€œa portionâ€ of his agenda to weaken collective-bargaining rights, limit workers injured on the job from obtaining compensation from employers, freeze property taxes and change how legislative district boundaries are drawn. House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton, both Chicago Democrats, declined to support big budget powers for Rauner. â€œWhat the governor is asking for is unilateral budget-making power,â€ Madigan said, adding a balanced approach of spending cuts and new revenue is needed. Illinois has the lowest credit ratings and worst-funded pensions among the 50 states. While the search continues for a constitutional way to rein in a $111 billion unfunded pension liability, Rauner proposed saving $4.8 billion over four years by shifting some retirement costs for 1,900 high-paid employees onto their local school districts, universities and community colleges. Pension-influencing, end-of-career salary increases would face a tighter cap, while state payment spikes caused by assumption changes by the stateâ€™s five retirement systems would be smoothed over five years. Rauner pledged to work on a bipartisan revamp of the stateâ€™s school funding formula, adding any proposal involving â€œtaking money from one school district and giving it to another is doomed.â€ He warned the Chicago Public Schools â€œis threatening a lawsuit against the state.â€ CPS CEO Forrest Claypool said the district, mired in its own financial crisis, is a victim of unequal funding by the state and could not ignore â€œany toolâ€ to protect students. He added that the governor was unwilling to address that inequity. Rauner proposed boosting per-student funding in K-12 public schools to $6,119, the highest level in seven years A fiscal 2016 school funding bill passed by Democrats last year marked the only major budget measure Rauner initially signed, leaving Illinois to operate on court-ordered spending and ongoing appropriations for bonds and pensions for the fiscal year that began July 1. Spending is largely at fiscal 2015 levels when revenue was higher thanks to income tax rates that had been temporarily raised, but which rolled back on Jan. 1, 2015, making Illinoisâ€™ finances even shaker. Public universities and scholarships for low-income college students remain unfunded. Several hundred protesters, mostly students from public universities, crowded into the State Capitol rotunda and chanted â€œsave our schoolsâ€ and â€œhey, hey, ho, ho, Governor Rauner has got to goâ€ while the governor delivered his speech inside the House chambers.  Illinoisâ€™ current $7.17 billion backlog of unpaid bills, a barometer of the ongoing structural budget imbalance, could be tackled partially through up to $4 billion in new borrowing that would cost less than the 12 percent penalty now tacked onto tardy state bill payments, an administration official said.", "output": "1.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: DAVOS, Switzerland  â€”     Donald Trump has never been invited here. Neither has Nigel Farage, the British politician who led the Brexit campaign. The World Economic Forum  â€”   an annual gathering of global policy and business leaders, who come to debate the worldâ€™s great challenges  â€”   gets underway here Monday night as the shifting political trends toward nationalism and against a sense of globalism are raising renewed questions about the relevance of the elites known as the â€œDavos class. â€ It is this group of   plutocrats that largely failed to anticipate  â€”   and may have even unconsciously generated  â€”   the seeping   movement across the globe. Every January, a glittering array of the cognoscenti descend on the Alps: the     Bill Gates, the   of Microsoft the billionaire investor George Soros Jack Ma, the founder of Chinaâ€™s   giant, Alibaba and  â€”   until recently  â€”   Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany. An assortment of Hollywood actors including Angelina Jolie, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon have made the pilgrimage over the years to promote their nonprofit work. And the conversations tend to be dominated by issues like inequality, climate change and the economic challenges facing developed and emerging countries. This year, the guest list includes names like President Xi Jinping of China Vice President Joseph Biden JPMorgan Chaseâ€™s chief executive, Jamie Dimon the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde and former Vice President Al Gore. And yet missing from these   conversations have been meaningful challengers or critics of the underlying theme that was seemingly stipulated from the birth of this event 46 years ago: Globalization has the potential to benefit everyone. â€œTrumpâ€™s election victory is a clear indication that the majority of people are not interested in a world government, but want to return to a classical, local democracy,â€ John Mauldin, an economic researcher and author, recently wrote. â€œStrange as it may seem to the Davos men, most people tend to love their â€˜patria,â€™ the land of their fathers. â€ Dissenting voices like those of Mr. Trump and Mr. Farage have rarely been part of the discussion  â€”   though perhaps that will change. Theresa May, Britainâ€™s new prime minister, will attend this year, as will some of Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers. But the victories of Mr. Trump and the Brexit campaign can be viewed as a rebuke of â€œDavos Man,â€ a name that Samuel Huntington, the Harvard political scientist, gave attendees in 2004, describing them as â€œtransnationalistsâ€ who â€œhave little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the eliteâ€™s global operations. â€ The middle class in the United States and Britain  â€”   and perhaps in France if Marine Le Pen, the   presidential candidate who has also never been invited to Davos, wins this spring  â€”   clearly havenâ€™t felt the benefits of the   world encouraged by multinational corporations that allows both immigration and commerce to take place without friction. â€œThey have witnessed the rise of the Davos class, a   network of banking and tech billionaires, elected leaders who are awfully cozy with those interests, and Hollywood celebrities who make the whole thing seem unbearably glamorous,â€ Naomi Klein, a columnist for The Guardian, wrote in a searing analysis of the American election in November. She described the failure of â€œelite neoliberalismâ€ to address the economic challenges of the masses. â€œSuccess,â€ she wrote, continuing to describe the middle class, â€œis a party to which they were not invited, and they know in their hearts that this rising wealth and power is somehow directly connected to their growing debts and powerlessness. â€ The Davos Man has either failed to properly articulate the benefits of open trade  â€”   or the reality of open trade is more complicated than previously imagined. In a nod to this new reality, the World Economic Forum has put together an index of what it calls inclusive growth and development, which measures 109 countries according to their progress on economic growth and reducing income inequality and breaks out subsets of those countries to compare with different data sets. According to the index, median income actually declined by 2. 4 percent between 2008 and 2013 across the 26 advanced economies where data is available, which may help explain the shifting political winds. â€œItâ€™s our response to how capitalism has failed us  â€”   and how we need to fix it,â€ said Adrian Monck, a member of the forumâ€™s executive committee. The United States ranked 23rd out of 30 advanced economies. In terms of wage and nonwage compensation, it ranked last in social protection, it came in 25th. It also came in 25th on â€œintermediation of business investmentâ€  â€”   in other words, the amount of money that goes into productive investments, such as research and development and infrastructure as opposed to share buybacks. (Norway ranked No. 1. Living standards there rose by 10. 6 percent from 2008 to 2013 while the economy grew only 0. 5 percent.) Mr. Monck defended the idea of a globalist approach. â€œThe benefits of globalization are there to see, in jobs in China, India and many emerging markets,â€ he said. â€œBillions of people owe better lives to it. â€ He invoked Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum. â€œWhat hasnâ€™t been listened to in Davos is persistent warnings from people like Klaus that the benefits need to be shared, and that you canâ€™t have    capitalism,â€ Mr. Monck said. Still, he acknowledged that the invitation list of insiders is by design. â€œWe always want the most comprehensive political attendance in Davos, to help support   cooperation, which is what we do,â€ he said. â€œThat inevitably means current, serving political figures. There are politicians in office now  â€”   and coming to Davos  â€”   who reflect this emergent agenda that youâ€™ve seen in the U. S. â€ For example, he said, leaders from Poland, Finland, Portugal and even Switzerland  â€”   where the Swiss Peopleâ€™s Party was an early example of the shift in the political landscape  â€”   will be on hand this week. A bevy of Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers and members of his business council are expected to attend, including Anthony Scaramucci, who joined the  â€™s White House staff as an adviser and public liaison to government agencies and businesses. He will be joined by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman of the Blackstone Group and also of Mr. Trumpâ€™s Presidentâ€™s Strategic and Policy Forum. Four Trump cabinet nominees have been to Davos in years past: Rick Perry (energy) once Rex Tillerson (state) three times Robert Lighthizer (trade) 15 times and Elaine Chao (transportation) four times. A few people who were once   crusaders  â€”   like Ms. May of Britain  â€”   are now insiders. And, depending how the political winds shift, more people of her ideological ilk may join the Davos class in 2018. This is not the first time that the World Economic Forum has come under fire from critics about its globalist,   message. In 2000, a group of more than 1, 000 demonstrators carrying signs that said â€œAgainst the New World Orderâ€ smashed the windows of a McDonaldâ€™s franchise here in Davos just down the road from the conference, protesting open trade policies espoused by   Bill Clinton, who was speaking at the event. Many of todayâ€™s policy makers and executives gathering here are expected to speak about the rise of populism and the need to adjust economic incentives. Hamdi Ulukaya, the chief executive of Chobani, the yogurt company, is expected to encourage business leaders to do more to address wealth building among employees he provided shares in his company to every   employee, making many of them millionaires. The question, of course, is whether those discussions can ever get beyond the theoretical for a group that is seen by many   voters as out of touch with the real economic challenges that people face. Conversations about income inequality, for example, have long had a tinge of class envy as opposed to a real appreciation for the basic jobs and wages that people are seeking. Still, with the word â€œDavosâ€ being tossed around as an epithet, some politicians are staying away from the Alps this year. Ms. Merkel, for example, has passed on attending now for two years in a row, in the face of continued criticism among German voters that she is too much of a globalist. So why do so many policy makers and executives still covet an invitation? Because Davos remains the worldâ€™s   shop to meet leaders from all corners of the globe. And despite the critiques of the gathering, a remarkable amount of business  â€”   both political and corporate  â€”   takes place behind the scenes. One thing is sure: The predictions made here  â€”   known as the Davos consensus  â€”   have a tendency to be wrong. Mr. Trump, with very few exceptions, was largely written off last year as a bad joke. â€œIf you bother to read some of the serious analysis of Trumpâ€™s support, you realize that itâ€™s a very fragile thing and highly unlikely to deliver what he needs in the crucial first phase of the primaries,â€ Niall Ferguson, the historian, predicted at Davos in 2016, according to Bloomberg News. â€œBy the time we get to   itâ€™s all over. I think thereâ€™s going to be a wonderful catharsis, Iâ€™m really looking forward to it: Trumpâ€™s humiliation. Bring it on. â€", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: WASHINGTON  â€”   When President Trump welcomes President Xi Jinping of China to his   Florida club for two days of meetings on Thursday, the studied informality of the gathering will bear the handiwork of two people: Chinaâ€™s ambassador to Washington and Mr. Trumpâ€™s    Jared Kushner. The Chinese ambassador, Cui Tiankai, has established a busy back channel to Mr. Kushner, according to several officials briefed on the relationship. The two men agreed on the club,    as the site for the meeting, and the ambassador even sent Mr. Kushner drafts of a joint statement that China and the United States could issue afterward. Mr. Kushnerâ€™s central role reflects not only the peculiar nature of this first meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, but also of the broader relationship between the United States and China in the early days of the Trump administration. It is at once highly personal and bluntly transactional  â€”   a strategy that carries significant risks, experts said, given the economic and security issues that already divide the countries. While Chinese officials have found Mr. Trump a bewildering figure with a penchant for inflammatory statements, they have come to at least one clear judgment: In Mr. Trumpâ€™s Washington, his    is the man to know. Mr. Kushner first made his influence felt in early February when he and Mr. Cui orchestrated a   phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. During that exchange, Mr. Trump pledged to abide by the    â€œOne Chinaâ€ policy on Taiwan, despite his earlier suggestion that it was up for negotiation. Now Mr. Trump wants something in return: He plans to press Mr. Xi to intensify economic sanctions against North Korea to pressure the country to shut down its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. He has also vowed to protest the chronic trade imbalance between the United States and China, which he railed against during his presidential campaign. Chinaâ€™s courtship of Mr. Kushner, which has coincided with the marginalization of the State Department in the Trump administration, reflects a Chinese comfort with dynastic links. Mr. Xi is himself a â€œprincelingâ€: His father was Xi Zhongxun, a major figure in the Communist revolution who was later purged by Mao Zedong. Not only is Mr. Kushner married to the presidentâ€™s daughter Ivanka, but he is also one of his most influential advisers  â€”   a    with no previous government experience but an exceptionally broad portfolio under his   . â€œSince Kissinger, the Chinese have been infatuated with gaining and maintaining access to the White House,â€ said Evan S. Medeiros, a senior director for Asia in the Obama administration. â€œHaving access to the presidentâ€™s family and somebody they see as a princeling is even better. â€ Former American officials and China experts warned that the Chinese had prepared more carefully for this visit than the White House, which is still debating how harshly to confront Beijing, and which has yet to fill many important posts in the State Department. Several said that if Mr. Trump presented China with an ultimatum on North Korea, it could backfire. â€œChina will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they wonâ€™t,â€ Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Financial Times that was published on Sunday. â€œAnd if they do, that will be very good for China, and if they donâ€™t, it wonâ€™t be good for anyone. â€ The president said that he had â€œgreat respectâ€ for the Chinese leader, but that he would warn him that â€œwe cannot continue to trade if we are going to have an unfair deal like we have right now. â€ Shortly after winning the election, Mr. Trump said he might use the â€œOne Chinaâ€ policy, under which the United States recognizes a single Chinese government in Beijing and has severed its diplomatic ties with Taiwan, as a bargaining chip for greater Chinese cooperation on trade or North Korea. Mr. Trump had thrown that policy into doubt after taking a congratulatory phone call from the president of Taiwan. That caused consternation in Beijing, and Mr. Xi refused to get on the phone with Mr. Trump until he reaffirmed the policy. After the two leaders finally spoke, the White House said in a statement that the men had â€œdiscussed numerous topics, and President Trump agreed, at the request of President Xi, to honor our One China policy. â€ Mr. Trump insisted on that wording, according to a person briefed on the process, because he wanted to make clear that he had made a concession to Mr. Xi. Since that call, Mr. Cui has continued to cultivate the Kushner family. Later in February, he invited Ivanka and the coupleâ€™s daughter, Arabella, to a reception at the Chinese Embassy to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Inside the White House, the most visible sign of Mr. Kushnerâ€™s influence on China policy came in March at the beginning of a meeting of the National Security Councilâ€™s â€œprincipals committeeâ€ to discuss North Korea. He was seated at the table in the Situation Room when Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, walked in. Seeing no chairs open, General Dunford headed for the backbenches, according to two people who were there. Mr. Kushner, they said, quickly offered his chair to General Dunford and took a seat along the wall. While administration officials confirm that Mr. Kushner is deeply involved in China relations, they insist that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has taken the lead on policy and made many of the decisions on the choreography and agenda of the meeting at   . In March, Mr. Tillerson made his first trip to Beijing as secretary of state, during which he and Mr. Xi discussed the planning in a   meeting. He was criticized afterward for repeating the phrases â€œmutual respectâ€ and â€œ  solutions,â€ which are drawn from the Chinese diplomatic lexicon and have been interpreted to assert a Chinese sphere of influence over the South China Sea and other disputed areas. A senior American official said that Mr. Tillerson applied his own meaning to those phrases  â€”   â€œâ€ he said, was originally an American expression  â€”   and was not accepting Chinaâ€™s definition. He said the secretary had adopted a significantly tougher tone in private, particularly about Chinaâ€™s role in curbing North Koreaâ€™s provocations. Mr. Kushner has passed on proposals he got from Mr. Cui to Mr. Tillerson, who in turn has circulated them among his staff in the State Department, officials said. But the departmentâ€™s influence has been reduced as many positions remain unfilled, including that of assistant secretary for East Asian affairs. Though Mr. Tillerson has kept a low profile, officials said he was trying to develop his own relationship with Mr. Trump at regular lunches and dinners. Mr. Kushnerâ€™s involvement in China policy prompted questions after reports that his company was negotiating with a politically connected Chinese firm to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in his familyâ€™s flagship property, 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. On Wednesday, amid the glare of negative publicity, Mr. Kushnerâ€™s company ended negotiations with the firm, the Anbang Insurance Group. Another question hanging over the meeting is whether the   in the White House will wield their influence. Mr. Trump ran for the presidency on a stridently   platform, accusing the Chinese, wrongly, of continuing to depress the value of their currency, and threatening to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. The architects of that policy  â€”   Stephen K. Bannon, the chief strategist, and Peter Navarro, the director of the National Trade Council  â€”   have said little publicly about China since entering the White House. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump predicted that the meeting would be â€œvery difficultâ€ because, as he said on Twitter, the United States would no longer tolerate â€œmassive trade deficits. â€ By inviting Mr. Xi to    Mr. Trumpâ€™s â€œSouthern White House,â€ the president is conferring on him the same status as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who spent two days in Florida, playing golf with the president and responding to a crisis after North Korea tested a ballistic missile. Such a gesture is particularly valuable, experts said, given that China is not an ally like Japan. Mr. Xi does not play golf  â€”   as part of his   campaign, he cracked down on Communist Party officialsâ€™ playing the sport  â€”   so he and Mr. Trump will have to find other ways to fill the 25 hours that the Chinese president will be at the club. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, will host Mr. Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, for dinner. There are obvious parallels between the    meeting and the 2013 summit meeting at Sunnylands in California, Walter Annenbergâ€™s   estate, where President Barack Obama and Mr. Xi got acquainted over long walks in the desert landscape and a dinner of grilled porterhouse steaks and cherry pie. But there are important differences, too. By the time Mr. Obama met with Mr. Xi in California, they had already met once before, when Mr. Xi was vice president. Mr. Xi held extensive meetings with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. traveling with him around the United States. Some former officials said the    meeting might reveal the disparity in experience between the two leaders and their teams. â€œSunnylands was difficult because Xi was new, while Obama had his sea legs,â€ said Mr. Medeiros, the former Obama administration official. â€œWhatâ€™s interesting is that the polarity here is reversed. Xi has his sea legs Trump does not. â€", "output": "1. True"}
{"instruction": "Task: Please determine whether the text is 0. False, 1. TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: WASHINGTON  â€”   Edgar M. Welch, a    father of two from Salisbury, N. C. recently read online that Comet Ping Pong, a pizza restaurant in northwest Washington, was harboring young children as sex slaves as part of a   ring led by Hillary Clinton. The articles making those allegations were widespread across the web, appearing on sites including Facebook and Twitter. Apparently concerned, Mr. Welch drove about six hours on Sunday from his home to Comet Ping Pong to see the situation for himself, according to court documents. Not long after arriving at the pizzeria, the police said, he fired from an     rifle. The police arrested him. They found a rifle and a handgun in the restaurant. No one was hurt. In an arraignment on Monday, a heavily tattooed Mr. Welch, wearing a white jumpsuit and shackles, was ordered held. According to the criminal complaint, he told the authorities that he was armed to help rescue children but that he surrendered peacefully after finding no evidence that â€œchildren were being harbored in the restaurant. â€ He was charged with four counts, including felony assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a gun without a license outside a home or business. Unbeknown to Mr. Welch, what he had been reading online were fake news articles about Comet Ping Pong, which have swollen in number over time. The false articles against the pizzeria began appearing on social networks and websites in late October, not long before the presidential election, with the restaurant identified as being the headquarters for a   ring. The articles were soon exposed as false by publications including The New York Times, The Washington Post and the   website Snopes. But the debunking did not squash the conspiracy theories about Comet Ping Pong  â€”   instead, it led to the opposite. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have been flooded with more attacks against the pizzeria as believers in the   conspiracy became more zealous. Within hours of the publication of one of the debunking articles, a post on Twitter by Representative Steven Smith of the 15th District of Georgia  â€”   not a real lawmaker and not a real district  â€”   warned that what was fake was the information being peddled by the mainstream media. It was retweeted dozens of times. On YouTube, a    takedown of the Times article was viewed nearly 250, 000 times and passed around on Twitter and Facebook. A surge of new fake articles amplified the original pieces, now linking the   ring  â€”   known as Pizzagate  â€”   to a global pedophilia ring reaching Britain. â€œWe should all condemn the efforts of certain people to spread malicious and utterly false accusations about Comet Ping Pong,â€ James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, said in a statement on Sunday. Mr. Alefantis, who has repeatedly refuted the fake news articles, has closed the pizzeria for a few days. He has prominent Democratic friends and previously communicated with Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman, which he has said may have made him a target. The shooting underscores the stubborn lasting power of fake news and how hard it is to stamp out. Debunking false news articles can sometimes stoke the outrage of the believers, leading fake news purveyors to feed that appetite with more misinformation. Efforts by social media companies to control the spread of these stories are limited, and shutting one online discussion thread down simply pushes the fake news creators to move to another space online. â€œThe reason why itâ€™s so hard to stop fake news is that the facts donâ€™t change peopleâ€™s minds,â€ said Leslie Harris, a former president of the Center for Democracy  Technology, a nonprofit that promotes free speech and open internet policies. When users are caught abusing the terms of one media platform, they simply go to another, she said. The viral nature of the misinformation was illustrated again late Sunday, not long after the police arrested Mr. Welch and called Pizzagate a â€œfictitious online conspiracy theoryâ€ in their report. Some individuals on Twitter said Mr. Welch was an actor used by the mainstream media to divert attention from the alleged crimes at Comet Ping Pong. Followers of a shuttered Reddit thread on Pizzagate dissected the episode on a new online network called Voat. The storm of fake news has swept up not only Comet Ping Pong, but its neighboring businesses. Conspiracy theorists have linked symbols that some local businesses on the same street as Comet Ping Pong used in their logos to symbols of pedophilia code. At Terasol, a French restaurant across the street from Comet Ping Pong, the owner, Sabrina Ousmaal, said she received daily phone threats and her businessâ€™s Facebook page had been filled with false accusations, including, â€œYou guys mind explaining the pedophilia symbol removed from your website then?â€ She added that the symbol was not on her restaurant but on the store of a nearby shop and was a swirl within a triangle. Ms. Ousmaal said she and her husband had called the police and the F. B. I. but had received little guidance. â€œI am appalled and horrified,â€ Ms. Ousmaal said of the shooting on Sunday. â€œNothing has been done. This is not free speech. This is a hate crime. â€ Tech companies and government leaders have been struggling to solve the problem of fake news, with Facebookâ€™s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, earlier promising to work on technology tools to slow the gusher of false digital information. In a news briefing on Monday, Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said free speech rights pose a challenge for media platforms to prevent misinformation from leading to episodes like the gunman at Comet Ping Pong. â€œMany of the entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley didnâ€™t develop this technology to make it easier for hate to be propagated online their idea was to build a community where people could more effectively communicate and engage in commerce,â€ Mr. Earnest said. â€œIf you do administer a platform that is used extensively to propagate hate and to inspire acts of violence, well, I think most people are going to be less likely to use the platform. â€ For purveyors of fake news who have continued pushing the Pizzagate theory even after the facts have been debunked, whether Comet Ping Pong is even engaged in a pedophilia ring is beyond the point. Jeffrey Marty, a lawyer from Florida, said in a phone interview that he was the man posing as Representative Steven Smith from Georgiaâ€™s fictional 15th District. He said that he was frustrated with the way the mainstream media covered the election and that he believes that most of his 24, 000 followers know that his account is a parody. Mr. Marty, who has tweeted links to fake news stories and repeatedly said the mainstream media needs to investigate Pizzagate, declined to say whether he actually believed the Comet Ping Pong allegations. â€œI just think you need to investigate. There are clues everywhere,â€ he said. â€œBut I donâ€™t agree with what happened at the restaurant. â€ Mr. Welch has long supported family values, his friends said Monday. He briefly volunteered at the Locke Township Fire Department in Salisbury, according to the chief, Rusty Alexander. Friends described Mr. Welch as a doting father who loved the outdoors. While he had been arrested while driving impaired in 2013 and was sentenced to probation, the shooting on Sunday was out of character, his friends said. â€œThatâ€™s not at all the person I know,â€ Louis Bodak, whose son Matthew is a good friend of Mr. Welchâ€™s, said about the shooting. Mr. Welch is scheduled to appear in court again on Thursday.", "output": "1. True"}

Wang, a key ally of President Xi Jinping, stepped down in a leadership reshuffle last month at the end of the five-yearly Communist Party Congress, but could assume a new role, say sources with ties to the leadership, though an announcement  might not come for a few more weeks.  As the feared head of the party s anti-corruption watchdog for the past five years, Wang has spearheaded Xi s battle on graft, overseeing the jailing of dozens of former top officials, including the domestic security chief, Zhou Yongkang. China has rebuffed criticism that the corruption campaign is as much about settling political scores as about stamping out genuine criminal acts.  Writing in the party s official People s Daily, Wang said the fight against corruption went beyond battling the pilfering of assets or hedonism and was a political battle.   Political corruption is the biggest corruption,  Wang wrote in comments drawn from a collection of essays released after the congress, but not previously published in full by state media.  The collection included pieces by former members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the height of power in China. Aspects of political corruption include the formation of special interest groups to try and seize power, and the organization of  activities outside party parameters, aimed at breaking party unity, Wang wrote.  There are many new historical special characteristics to carrying on this great fight, the most important of which are to ... prevent them from seizing political power and changing the party s basic character,  he added. Wang explicitly linked some of the most notorious cases to political crimes, mentioning not only Zhou but also the former party bosses of the southwestern city of Chongqing, Bo Xilai and Sun Zhengcai, two former top generals and a former top aide to retired president Hu Jintao. In these cases, the party had  eradicated interest groups which mixed political and economic corruption , Wang wrote. Bo was jailed for life in 2013, while Sun was put under investigation for corruption in July. There can be no challenges to the party s power, Wang added.

Government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani told state news agency Petra that the announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump violated long-standing U.N. Security Council resolutions that  stipulated the non-recognition of the Israeli occupation  of the city s eastern sector and the adjacent West Bank.  The staunch U.S. ally considered  all unilateral moves that seek to create new facts on the ground as null and void , the spokesman added. Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said later in a tweet that the move  frustrated  peace efforts, adding that the status of Jerusalem must be  determined in direct negotiations  between the Palestinians and Israelis.  Jordan rejects the decision and all its implications and will continue to work for an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,  Safadi added. Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 war and says the city s fate should only be decided at the end of a final settlement. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem for the capital of a future state. Israel regards Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital. Jordan s King Abdullah warned of the repercussions of Trump s expected move in talks last week in Washington with top administration officials and warned of a backlash across the Middle East.  The king s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Jordan sensitive to any changes in the status of the city. A government source said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was due to hold talks with the monarch on Thursday in a  stepped-up diplomatic offensive to counter Trump s plan. Several protests broke out in areas of Jordan s capital, Amman, inhabited by Palestinian refugees in response to Trump s announcement. Youths chanted anti-American slogans in Amman, while in the Baqaa refugee camp on the city s outskirts, hundreds of youths roamed the streets denouncing Trump and calling on Jordan s government to scrap its 1994 peace treaty with Israel.  Down with America. America is the mother of terror,  they chanted. Jordanian deputies in a special parliamentary session on Wednesday condemned the move and urged the government to expel the U.S. ambassador and boycott U.S. goods. A dozen activists staged a sit-in near the gates of the U.S. embassy. Many people in Jordan are descendants of Palestinian refugees whose families left after the creation of Israel in 1948.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: A suspect in a bombing was still at large Monday morning, his motives and intentions unknown  â€”   but Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump were already racing to seize the political upper hand. With a manhunt still in progress before an arrest later in the day, Mrs. Clinton sought to shift the terms of the presidential contest back in her direction. She called Mr. Trump a â€œrecruiting sergeant for the terroristsâ€ and, from a rainy airport in White Plains, offered herself as a seasoned warrior against terrorism. Mr. Trump returned fire hours later, blaming Mrs. Clinton and President Obamaâ€™s handling of immigration and the Iraq war for bringing terrorism to American shores. He called for vigorous police profiling of people from the Muslim world and drew a direct equation between immigration controls and national defense. The attacks could reframe the presidential race around stark questions of national security after weeks of   sniping between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton over more personal matters of character, transparency and medical records. The violence of the weekend is all but certain to ripple in the first presidential debate, set for next Monday at Hofstra University on Long Island. For both the candidates and their parties, the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend are a critical inflection point. Not since the Iraq war has the mantle of national security and protection been more vigorously contested than it has been in this campaign, or its textures more difficult to define. With seven weeks left in the campaign, the candidatesâ€™ responses to an apparent terrorist plot on American soil could sharply alter votersâ€™ views not only of them but of the parties they lead. And both candidates set up extraordinary stakes, each asserting that the other was not only wrong on national security, but actively abetting terrorists in word or deed. It was Mrs. Clinton who appeared most determined to bend the moment to her advantage. Unlike most Democratic nominees, she has enjoyed an edge over her Republican opponent on issues of national security and foreign policy. Having faced a rocky stretch in the presidential race, punctuated by a bout of pneumonia, she appeared to welcome a renewed debate over terrorism. Before flying to Philadelphia to court younger voters, Mrs. Clinton held a news conference to call for â€œcourage and vigilanceâ€ in the face of terrorism, and warned that Mr. Trump was unprepared to keep the country safe. Citing former intelligence and counterterrorism officials who have criticized Mr. Trumpâ€™s caustic remarks about Islam, Mrs. Clinton leveled an attack that might have shocked the political world in any other campaign: In addition to calling him a â€œrecruiting sergeantâ€ for terrorists, she accused him of giving â€œaid and comfortâ€ to the Islamic State with his campaign oratory. â€œWeâ€™re going after the bad guys, and weâ€™re going to get them, but weâ€™re not going after an entire religion,â€ Mrs. Clinton said, adding, â€œWe know that Donald Trumpâ€™s comments have been used online for the recruitment of terrorists. â€ It was the most drastic version yet of an attack Mrs. Clinton has tried out recently with increasing boldness: In an interview on Israeli television this month, she said the Islamic State was praying for Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory, and she has warned that foreign adversaries could seek to sway the election in her opponentâ€™s favor. Mr. Trump, she said on Monday, has helped the Islamic State and other terrorist groups cast their attacks as part of a religious war between Islam and the West. â€œThey are looking to make this into a war against Islam, rather than a war against jihadists, violent terrorists,â€ Mrs. Clinton said. â€œThe kinds of rhetoric and language Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries. â€ Mr. Trump responded with indignation. His campaign released a string of statements expressing outrage, criticizing Mrs. Clinton for favoring more lenient immigration policies and calling her attack on Mr. Trump tantamount to an accusation of treason. At a rally in Florida on Monday afternoon, Mr. Trump blasted Mrs. Clinton for failing, as a member of the Obama administration, to stop the rise of the Islamic State, employing much the same     argument he has used to demand an overhaul of government on domestic matters. â€œHer weakness, her ineffectiveness, caused the problem, and now she wants to be president,â€ he said. â€œI donâ€™t think so. â€ Mr. Trump directly equated American vulnerability to terrorism with what he called laxness in the immigration system. He has mainly warned about the risk of admitting refugees from Syria and other   countries, though the suspect arrested in the weekend attacks, Ahmad Khan Rahami, is a naturalized citizen born in Afghanistan and has lived in the United States for years. â€œThese attacks, and many others, were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system,â€ Mr. Trump said, trying to return the political debate to the issue he is most comfortable discussing. â€œImmigration security,â€ he added, â€œis national security. â€ But Mr. Trump may have to clear a higher standard than merely keeping up, punch for punch, with Mrs. Clinton. While he has drawn close to her in the polls, he still faces broad reservations among voters about his readiness to serve as commander in chief. In the past, he has provoked a backlash after terror attacks by fulminating against Muslims and shifting too quickly onto the offensive. If Mr. Trump finished the day with a forceful speech denouncing Mrs. Clinton, he began with a meandering telephone interview with Fox News, during which he asserted that there were â€œmany foreign connectionsâ€ to the weekend attacks, though none had been established. And he suggested, again without supplying evidence, that American police officers fail to act against terrorism suspects because of political correctness. Mr. Trump also applauded himself for having described the Saturday night explosion in New York City as a bombing even before the police did. â€œI should be a newscaster,â€ he said. â€œI called it before the news. â€ The hostilities between the candidates erupted at the start of a week when both were aiming to cut a presidential profile and to strengthen their credentials on the international stage by meeting with foreign leaders in New York at the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly. In many respects, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign against Mr. Trump has flipped the traditional contours of defense politics, offering voters a Democrat with more hawkish instincts and deeper ties to the national security establishment, and a Republican who has broadly rejected military intervention and has been spurned by many defense leaders in his own party. Mrs. Clinton is by far the more conventionally experienced and credentialed candidate, and in some respects is more hawkish: She has called for the creation of a   zone in Syria, as well as more airstrikes there, and has urged closer collaboration with Silicon Valley to expand the United Statesâ€™ surveillance capabilities, alarming some civil liberties advocates. In Mr. Trump, she confronts a candidate who has been abandoned by most of his partyâ€™s national security elite, who is still unable to produce a detailed set of proposals for stopping terrorism, and whose essential political brand  â€”   disruption  â€”   does not always comfort voters seeking strength in moments of crisis and terror. Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman for Mr. Obama, said that if Democrats were conventionally cast as the â€œmommy partyâ€ and Republicans as the â€œdaddy partyâ€ in American politics, then â€œTrump is the crazy uncle and Hillary Clinton is the only person you trust to watch your family for a week. â€ Mr. Trump has also cast doubt on American participation in NATO and spoken warmly of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president and strongman. And in recent days, he has feuded with Robert M. Gates, a highly regarded former defense secretary, and found himself mocked by another respected national security figure, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who called Mr. Trump â€œa national disgrace and an international pariahâ€ in private emails released by hackers last week. Whatever doubts many voters still have about Mrs. Clintonâ€™s trustworthiness, most appear to consider her better suited to manage foreign policy and threats to the American people. Before the Chelsea bombing, according to a New York   News poll, voters gave her a slight edge on the question of who would better handle terrorism and national security, and a large one on foreign policy. Some polling suggests that she has a bigger lead over Mr. Trump on related questions  â€”   who would be a better commander in chief, for example  â€”   than past Democratic nominees have had over Republicans. â€œVoters look for the qualities of experience, temperament and judgment,â€ said Evan McMullin, a former intelligence officer who is running for president as a conservative independent candidate. â€œHillary Clinton and Donald Trump lack some or all of them. But Trump lacks all of them. â€", "output": "1. True"}

Betting venues in Britain, Ireland and New Zealand show the online wagering community coalescing around Trump, once considered a rank outsider attracting long-shot odds of 200/1. Following his double-digit margin win in Nevadaâ€™s Republican caucuses on Tuesday, his third victory in the first four early nominating contests, odds have tightened all the way to 1/2 in some cases. â€œMr Trump has triumphed yet again, despite political analysts almost unanimously writing him off as a serious presidential contender,â€ said Graham Sharpe from William Hill, adding one customer stood to collect at least $100,000 if Trump was elected to the White House on Nov. 8.  William Hill and Betway make Trump 1/2 favorite to get the Republican nod, while Ladbrokes cut his odds to 4/9, the same as those shown on Irelandâ€™s PaddyPower. His nearest rival, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, featured odds of 6/1 on Ladbrokes. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who has been battling with Rubio for the No. 2 spot in the early voting states, has sunk to a deep longshot. Paddy Power gives Cruz odds of 33/1, its site shows. Bettors also markedly cut the odds on Trump becoming president, although he still trails Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who won Nevadaâ€™s Democratic caucuses on Saturday. Jessica Bridge from Ladbrokes said Trump was on a roll heading into Super Tuesday on March 1, when several U.S. states hold nominating contests. On PredictIt, a site operated by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, Trumpâ€™s chances of winning the Republican nod were the highest since it started tracking the race in October 2015.  A Trump bet there, on a scale of $0.00 to $1, stood at 72 cents, up 4 cents, while Rubio tumbled 7 cents to 24 cents and Cruz sank a penny to 4 cents, matching a record low.

Philip Hammond, Britain s finance minister, echoed recent EU assertions when he said that a transition period to some new relationship was a  wasting asset , the value of which would  diminish significantly  for both sides if its form remains unclear to businesses much after the start of the new year. As negotiators in Brussels make little progress before Prime Minister Theresa May meets EU leaders next week, a warning about a breakdown in talks from a minister seen strongly to favor a business-friendly  bespoke  transition out of the EU came a day after the EU summit chair spoke of a similar new year deadline. Donald Tusk said on Tuesday that if London fails to settle divorce terms by December, and so unlock talks on the transition and future trade pact, then the EU would reconsider its objectives. That reflects mounting doubts across Europe that any legal exit deal can be struck. The longer the stand-off goes on, EU negotiators said, the more Britain s choice come March 30, 2019, will be between the  hard Brexit  by which it will simply quit all EU systems and be treated like, say, Australia, and a virtual status quo, staying in most EU systems, without voting rights, rather like Norway.  The closer we get, the less there is to discuss about a transition and the more it just goes to a standstill transition, with Britain still in everything, but without a vote,  one said.  Pretty soon,  said another,  It will be Norway or nothing.  While all such commentary reflects the sides  jockeying for negotiating advantage, the evidence this week is that they remain far apart and are getting tetchy. May and the EU traded jabs over whose court  the ball  is in after the prime minister made concessions in a speech at Florence on Sept. 22. Behind closed doors, British negotiators voiced outraged surprise that her offer was seen as insufficient to launch talks on the future relationship.  It s hard to say it was genuine,  one EU official said of the show of emotion.  It s a form of pressure.  Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU negotiator Michel Barnier are due to give a news conference around noon (1000 GMT) on Thursday to give an update on the week s progress. Businesses are sounding the alarm. A German industry federation warned members to start preparing for a  very hard Brexit . A senior representative of London s financial services industry told a Brussels audience this week that a legal transition agreement must be reached by the end of this year.  Most importantly, it must reflect the status quo,  said Catherine McGuinness of the City of London Corporation.  There is no feasibility in asking firms to transition to a transition. If uncertainty continues, businesses will vote with their feet.  Hammond ruled out budgeting   yet   for more customs and border facilities, and few on the continent believe threats of a walkout they say would hurt Britain more than them. So leaders will watch May s struggle to unite her government and sit tight. One senior EU diplomat said British counterparts were in such a weak position that  sometimes I feel sorry them . For many in Brussels, that makes a virtual status quo after Brexit the increasingly likely outcome:  In March 2019, Britain will formally leave,  said another EU official.   But de facto most of the existing arrangements will remain ... They will have their celebration of  independence  and then we will sit down to talking business again.  May insists a two-year transition period is enough to agree a new free trade pact, but many question that.  John Bruton, the former prime minister of Ireland, has recommended an alternative to either no deal at all or a virtual status quo transition   just keeping Britain fully in the EU for four years beyond 2019. Arguing that the two-year deadline set by Article 50 of the EU treaty raises the risk of talks collapsing, and that agreeing first a transition and then another accord is complex, Bruton said this week that Britain and the EU should agree to a six-year negotiating period, with Britain only leaving in 2023. Neither wants any extension. But Bruton warned:  The present tight time frame ... increases the likelihood of miscalculation and of the UK leaving the EU with no deal at all.", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: NICOSIA, Cyprus  â€”   As the United Nations geared up for negotiations that it declared the â€œbest and last chanceâ€ to unite Cyprus after more than four decades of acrimonious division, Russiaâ€™s ambassador attended a seminar dedicated to derailing any prospect of an agreement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The presence of the ambassador, Stanislav Osadchiy, delighted   Greek Cypriot politicians in Nicosia, the capital of the   south of the divided island. They had helped torpedo a 2004 reunification plan supported by the United States and have now rallied together to defeat a new push for a settlement that began on Jan. 12 with an international conference in Geneva. But Mr. Osadchiyâ€™s attendance at the seminar, which Western and other diplomats shunned, angered Nicos Anastasiades, the   president of the Republic of Cyprus and a strong supporter of efforts to resolve an interethnic dispute as intractable and nearly as protracted as the   conflict. In an interview in Nicosia, Mr. Anastasiades said that, when questioned, the ambassador had apologized and said he had misunderstood the nature of the seminar, despite its clear   agenda and the fact that it had been organized by five small political parties all bitterly opposed to a compromise deal in Geneva. The president said he accepted the ambassadorâ€™s explanation and his insistence that he had not meant to endorse the   rejectionists by attending. But, Mr. Anastasiades added, â€œI consider any intervention by any third country as not what we are looking for. â€ Like countless previous diplomatic efforts to reunite Cyprus since Turkey invaded in 1974 and split the country in two, the recent Geneva talks failed to achieve a breakthrough, though they did make some progress. Mr. Anastasiades said the two sides were â€œhalfwayâ€ to an agreement but still had deep divisions, notably on the issue of whether Turkey, Greece and Britain, the former colonial master, should retain their status as â€œguarantorsâ€ of the islandâ€™s security, a setup that Russia rejects. Bound to Russia by a shared Orthodox Christian faith and its role as a financial and banking center for Russian business, the Republic of Cyprus, the   nation in the south of the island, has long looked to Moscow as a protector rather than a troublemaker. But accusations that Moscow intervened to skew the United States presidential election and supported   forces across Europe have stirred a wave of alarm about Russia in the European Union, of which the Republic of Cyprus is a member. This alarm, which Russia dismisses as Russophobic hysteria, has given new force to voices in Cyprus warning that Russiaâ€™s geopolitical interests have made it determined to upset a Cyprus settlement. Makarios Drousiotis, a   researcher who has long bucked   sentiment in Cyprus and sought to expose what he sees as Russian meddling, said events in the United States and Europe were shaking his compatriotsâ€™ view that Moscow had only their best interests at heart. â€œWhat they have been doing in America and Europe they have been doing for 50 years in Cyprus,â€ said Mr. Drousiotis, who in 2014 published a book, â€œThe Cyprus Crisis and the Cold War,â€ that demolished what he called a   â€œmythâ€ that the West is to blame for Turkeyâ€™s 1974 invasion of the island and the decades of division that followed. The book, denounced by Russiaâ€™s diplomatic mission in Nicosia as â€œpolitically unacceptable,â€ portrayed Moscow as a duplicitous partner that had for decades used disinformation, front organizations and other tools of subterfuge to woo support among   while working behind the scenes to stoke tensions to ensure that Cyprus never aligned too firmly with the West or became a NATO member. To Moscowâ€™s fury, this once taboo view that Russia wants to block a settlement has in recent weeks been discussed openly in some Cypriot media outlets. The Cyprus Mail, for example, described Russiaâ€™s ambassador, Mr. Osadchiy, as â€œthe darlingâ€ of   forces â€œbecause he regularly says things aimed at undermining the talks or making the pursuit of a deal more difficult. â€ Maria Zakharova, Russiaâ€™s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said Moscow was â€œsurprised by the   comments in the Cyprus mediaâ€ and accused the media of creating â€œa smoke screen for the real problems that need to be tackled as part of the Cypriot settlement. â€ Mr. Drousiotis said the Russian ambassadorâ€™s apparent support for   rejectionist politicians ahead of the Geneva talks fit a long, but previously mostly ignored, pattern. â€œEvery time there has been an attempt to solve the Cyprus issue, the Russians have jumped in to block a settlement,â€ Mr. Drousiotis said. A solution in Cyprus would end a deep rift within NATO between Turkey and Greece, both members, and open the way to the development of large gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean that could upset the grip of Gazprom, Russiaâ€™s   energy giant, on the Turkish market. Turkey imports nearly 99 percent of its natural gas, more than half from Russia, its biggest supplier by far. Gas from Egyptian, Israeli and Cypriot fields in the Mediterranean would be cheaper than supplies from Gazprom, but it has little chance of reaching Turkish consumers so long as arguments over territorial waters and other matters between Greek and Turkish Cypriots obstruct the development of pipelines. In 2004, ahead of a referendum in Cyprus on whether to accept a reunification plan proposed by Kofi Annan, who was the secretary general of the United Nations at the time, Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution relating to security arrangements on the island that all other Council members supported. Hopes for the   Annan plan then took another big blow when AKEL, the influential   communist party in southern Cyprus, dropped its previous support and, on the eve of the referendum, urged voters to reject the plan, as did the Orthodox Church. In the end, the north voted to accept the plan, while voters in the south rejected it. Yet another international effort collapsed after hackers penetrated the United Nations computer system and, in 2009, leaked emails and documents to a   Cypriot newspaper. Some of the documents were doctored in a way that inflamed   fears of any settlement. The United Nations concluded that only a foreign intelligence service could have orchestrated such an operation. Mr. Anastasiades, speaking at the presidential palace in Nicosia, said that his country counted Russia as a friend, but that it had to take care not to give fuel to those who questioned Russiaâ€™s intentions, as the ambassador did by attending the seminar. Russia has responded angrily to accusations that it has been working against its own stated policy in favor of a Cyprus solution. Vladimir A. Chizhov, Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the European Union, issued a scathing statement on Jan. 13 to denounce what he called â€œpreposterousâ€ reports that Russia wanted to block a settlement. â€œEvidently,   hysteria is becoming contagious. Overzealous fighters of the (dis) information front are working day and night trying to implicate Russia in all sorts of problems, including those that are the direct result of shortsighted and arrogant policies of others,â€ Mr. Chizhov, a veteran diplomat who earlier served at the embassy in Nicosia, said in the statement. Harry Tzimitras, director of the Nicosia branch of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said many obstacles blocked a settlement irrespective of Russia, notably the gulf between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on the issue of whether the Turkish military should be allowed to keep troops on the island after reunification. â€œThe fundamental mistrustâ€ between the two sides, Mr. Tzimitras said, is the main reason for the failure of decades of diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement. â€œIn Cyprus, you rarely fight facts,â€ he said. â€œYou fight perceptions and ghosts. â€ All the same, he added, some think that Russia has many reasons, despite its public position, to want the island to stay divided. â€œIn this view, the status quo is working very well for Russia,â€ Mr. Tzimitras said. â€œThey donâ€™t want it disrupted. â€ Aside from strengthening NATO and damaging Gazprom, a reunification deal would deliver a success to the United States, whose diplomats have been particularly active in trying to prod Greece, Turkey and their ethnic kin in Cyprus toward an agreement. Mr. Anastasiades said the main obstacle to a solution was Turkey, whose increasingly autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, recently said Turkish troops must be allowed to stay in Cyprus â€œforever. â€ Mr. Anastasiades has forged good relations with the leader of   northern Cyprus, Mustafa Akinci, but, he said, â€œthe solution does not depend on the Turkish Cypriots but on Ankaraâ€™s will. â€ The issue of troops is tightly connected with another big hurdle  â€”   demands by Mr. Anastasiades, urged on by Russia, that Turkey, Greece and Britain be stripped of their role as guarantors. Moscow has long wanted to scrap this system, continuing a   policy that was based in part on its desire to weaken the role of Britain, a NATO member that has military bases and a listening post in Cyprus. Mr. Anastasiades said it was up to Mr. Erdogan to decide what he wanted. â€œHis rhetoric is that he is in favor, but what remains to be seen is whether in practice he is supporting a solution,â€ Mr. Anastasiades said. As for Russia and the United States, Mr. Anastasiades said, Cyprus understands â€œthe games superpowers play. â€ â€œWe want the support of everyone who can give support,â€ he added. â€œIt is a matter of survival. â€", "output": "1.

Nearly 410,000 members of the Rohingya Muslim minority fled from Myanmar s western Rakhine state to Bangladesh to escape a military offensive that the United Nations has branded a  textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  Many people are arriving hungry, exhausted and with no food or water,  Mark Pierce, Bangladesh country director for the Save the Children aid agency said in a statement.  I m particularly worried that the demand for food, shelter, water and basic hygiene support is not being met due to the sheer number of people in need. If families can t meet their basic needs, the suffering will get even worse and lives could be lost.  Bangladesh has for decades faced influxes of Rohingya fleeing persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the Rohingya are regarded as illegal migrants. Bangladesh was already home to 400,000 Rohingya before the latest crisis erupted on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp in the western state of Rakhine, killing a dozen people. Pierce said the humanitarian response needed to be rapidly scaled up.  That can only be done if the international community steps up funding,  he said. Rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say Myanmar security forces and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes responded to the Aug. 25 insurgent attacks with what they say is a campaign of violence and arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population. Myanmar rejects that, saying its security forces are carrying out clearance operations against the insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which claimed responsibility for the August attacks and similar, smaller, raids in October. The Myanmar government has declared the group a terrorist organization and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians. Bangladesh border guards said the flow of refugees leaving Myanmar had eased off over the past day, apparently because bad weather had discouraged people from taking to boats to reach Bangladesh.  Heavy rain has turned roads into mud, with refugees huddling under shelters of bamboo and plastic sheets beside them. Bangladeshi authorities said they had started moving an estimated 100,000 Rohingya living by the roads to camps designated as aid points.  We re not allowing any distribution to anyone from the side of the road,  said district government official Kazi Abdur Rahman.  We want to convince them there s everything in the camp and nothing here.  A big new camp is planned but it is unclear how long it would take to build.  People are living in these muddy, awful conditions. You have to get them to some sort of space where aid can be delivered,  said Chris Lom of the International Organization for Migration.   Clean water and sanitation can only be delivered in a structured environment.  There is no sign that violence has stopped in Myanmar, with smoke, apparently from burning villages, seen as recently as Friday, meaning more refugees are likely to cross. Human Rights Watch said satellite imagery showed 62 Rohingya villages had been torched since the violence erupted. Myanmar says more than 430 people have been killed, most of them insurgents, and about 30,000 non-Muslim villagers have been displaced.  Myanmar government leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced a barrage of criticism from abroad for not stopping the violence. The military remains in full control of security policy and there is little sympathy for the Rohingya in a country where the end of army rule has unleashed old animosities, and the military campaign in Rakhine State is widely supported. Suu Kyi is due to make her first address to the nation on the crisis on Tuesday. Her foreign supporters and Western governments that backed her campaign against military rule, and see her as the best hope for Myanmar s future, will be hoping to see her make a commitment to protect the rights of the Muslim minority. Suu Kyi s supporters at home could be disappointed if she is perceived to be caving in to foreign pressure and taking the side of a Muslim minority blamed for initiating the violence. The United States has called for the protection of civilians and a deputy assistant secretary of state, Patrick Murphy, is due in Myanmar this week. He will travel to Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, to meet government officials and representatives of different communities, including Rohingya, but he is not seeking to travel to the conflict zone in northern Rakhine State. The military has called for unity on the issue. The political party founded by retired officers and trounced by Suu Kyi s party in the 2015 election, could be expected to take heart to see her support eroded by the crisis.", "output": "1. True"}

Maintaining U.S. creditworthiness is of the â€œutmost importanceâ€ and the United States must pay its bills on time, Mnuchin told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee. â€œAs Iâ€™ve suggested in the past, based upon our best estimate at the time, we do have funding through September, but I have urged Congress to take this up before they leave for the recess,â€ Mnuchin said. However there was little sign Congress would heed Mnuchinâ€™s call, at least for the moment. The House of Representatives is due to start its recess on Friday with no hint of movement on the issue, while the Senate is consumed with trying to pass a healthcare overhaul bill. That could leave the debt limit unaddressed until Congress returns on Sept. 5, perhaps one month before the Treasury runs a real risk of not being able to pay all of its obligations.   The last extension of the federal borrowing limit expired in March with total debt of around $20 trillion, but the Treasury has extended its ability to issue debt by employing extraordinary cash management measures, including deferring reinvestments in federal employee pension funds. But short-term Treasury bill markets have grown nervous about the potential for the Treasury to exhaust its borrowing capacity by mid-October, sending yields higher and crushing demand for a recent 3-month bill auction. The situation is costing taxpayers money and stoking market uncertainty, said Mnuchin, a former banker and Hollywood film financier.  â€œRight now effectively, as opposed to borrowing in the market at lower rates, weâ€™re borrowing and making our trust funds whole at slightly higher rates, so there is a real cost to doing that,â€ he said. â€œThereâ€™s also an implied cost of uncertainty into the market. And the longer we wait, that more that uncertainty will be.â€ Senator James Lankford, a Republican, said at the hearing that his best estimate, derived through working with Treasury officials, was that the use of extraordinary measures would amount to about $2.5 billion, largely because the government would have to cover interest owed to the affected pension funds. Mnuchin did not dispute that estimate. Lawmakers showed varying levels of concern on Capitol Hill this week as the Senate focused on trying to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. â€œRight now, my focus is Obamacare,â€ said Senator Ted Cruz when asked on Tuesday if the lack of action on the debt limit was a concern. Cruz led fellow Republicans in 2013 to demand spending cuts as part of a fiscal fight that led to a 16-day partial government shutdown. Another fiscal conservative senator, David Perdue, said however he would prefer that Congress stay in session in August to deal with raising the debt ceiling, adding: â€œWeâ€™ve just got to get it done.â€ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to pass a debt ceiling increase but does not have timing nailed down, a spokesman said.", "output": "1.

The fighting over the past two weeks has caused dozens of casualties, displaced hundreds of families, and put Sabratha s famed Roman ruins at risk.  Migrant crossings from Libya have dropped sharply since July, a change that the armed group, the Anas al-Dabbashi brigade, says is due to its policing of the coast near Sabratha under a deal with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. Brigade leader Ahmed al-Dabbashi, also known as Al-Ammu (the uncle) and described in a U.N. report as one of Libya s top smuggling facilitators, said the move had led to attacks by rivals smuggling from al-Wadi, an area just east of Sabratha.  We, al-Dabbashi brigade, had an agreement with Government of National Accord (GNA) to stop illegal migration,  Dabbashi told Reuters by phone in an interview, referring to the Tripoli administration.  Then we were surprised that after stopping migration the Shuhada al-Wadi brigade started coming at us with their four-by-four vehicles painted in military police colors and their members started wearing military uniforms.  They started harassing us because we stopped migration and this is bad for them,  Dabbashi said. A senior Dabbashi member said last week that the brigade s sudden shift from smuggling to policing was motivated by a desire for legitimacy in the form of police and army jobs for its members. It and the Italian government have denied reports that Dabbashi was paid by Italy to stop the migrant boats. Dabbashi said the Wadi brigade is aligned with the Operations Room, a force formed to oust Islamic State jihadists from Sabratha last year and that clashes began when Dabbashi s cousin Abubaker was killed at an Operations Room checkpoint.  Saleh Graisia, an Operations Room spokesman, said clashes erupted because the actions of the Dabbashi brigade and the allied Brigade 48 were  out of control . The Operations Room and its allies, which include ultra-conservative Salafists and locals from Al-Wadi, had moved to push  militias  from Sabratha, he said.   The Room has its own conditions. The top one is that all militias withdraw from the city and hand over their weapons so the city be under legitimacy of the police and army.  Fighting has led to the evacuation of hundreds of families from central Sabratha, said Essam Krir, head of an association of non-governmental organizations. Several civilians and at least 13 fighters have been killed, while dozens of combatants have been wounded, according to Dabbashi and Graisia.  Fighting has raged around Sabratha s hospital and its Roman ruins, a UNESCO World Heritage site. UNESCO s head appealed for all parties to  ensure the safeguarding of Sabratha s unique cultural heritage .  We have orders to not use heavy artillery for the protection of the ruins,  Graisia said. The Operations Room said on its Facebook page it had taken control of the ruins.

If you believe as I do that the illegal alien population of the U. S. is over 25 million, not 11. 3 million, then the percentage of Mexican nationals now residing in the  U. S.  â€”   persons recognized as Mexican citizens under the Mexican Constitution  â€”   is considerably above 25 percent.  Let me put this in stark economic terms: Mexicoâ€™s national income grows in direct proportion to the size of the illegal Mexican population inside the United States. Does that help explain the Mexican fixation on U. S. politics? Mexicoâ€™s most profitable export to the U. S. is not oil or avocados or automobile parts, it is people.  Mexicans living and working in the U. S. send home over $20 billion annually in cash remittances  â€”   more than Mexico earns in foreign currency from tourism or any export commodity. In 1979, Mexico received only $177, 000 (U. S. Dollars) in remittances in 2016 it was $26. 1 BILLION  â€”   over 90 percent of it from persons living in the United States. (See here for a GAO report on remittances to Mexico from the U. S. and here for the World Bank reports for total remittances received by Mexico.) You donâ€™t believe government data? Even the Clinton News Network confirms it: this recent CNN report says Mexico relies more on remittance income than the sale of oil or tourism.  To guarantee those remittance dollars keep flowing north to south, Mexico must keep exporting its citizens south to north. Does anyone think Mexico will give up that lucrative income graciously? Do you think Mexican politicians will welcome an interruption of either of those two flows  â€”   either people going north or dollars coming south? As a Congressman, back in 2001, I visited Mexico along with two of my colleagues and met with several high government officials in the Mexican capital. One of those officials was Juan Hernandez, a dual citizen with a home in Texas, who at that time was the head of a cabinet department. That department had the name, Ministry for Mexicans Living Abroad, but it has since been reorganized and given a lower public profile as the Institute for Mexicans Abroad, a   division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I asked SeÃ±or Hernandez, what exactly do you do here? He was quite candid and informative and not the least bit apologetic. Hernandezâ€™s job was to direct and coordinate a large collection of enterprises of transport and educational activities aimed at assisting and encouraging Mexicans in physically moving north across Mexico and entering the United States. I was struck by both the grandiosity and bravura of that official Mexican government operation â€”  directed by a cabinet official. Somewhat shocked by his candid admissions, I asked Hernandez, hey, arenâ€™t you embarrassed by violating the sovereignty of a neighboring country? His reply was delivered calmly and with a smile. I remember his words clearly:  â€œReally, congressman, we donâ€™t have two countries here, itâ€™s just a region. â€ I also asked Hernandez, why does the Mexican government work so hard to maintain contact with Mexicans even after they become naturalized citizens of the United States? He told me, itâ€™s because they tend to stop sending money home after they assimilate. Assimilation, he believed, was a problem: if Mexicans stopped being Mexicans first, and Americans second, that is very bad for Mexico. Juan Hernandez, as I said, is a dual citizen of Mexico and the United States, and he has been very involved in U. S. politics. In 2008, working from his Texas home, he was named as presidential candidate John McCainâ€™s chief of Outreach to Hispanic Americans.   You can make of that connection with John McCain what you will maybe the guy just needed a job. But as for myself, I would worry if my candidate were endorsed by the Juan Hernandez characters of the world, and I am delighted that SeÃ±or Juan Hernandez is apoplectic over the plans announced by President Trump.  What lies ahead for U. S.  relations? Your guess is as good as mine, but if Trump persists in his plans, Mexican bluster and outrage will be replaced by a more pragmatic accommodation.  The border will continue to be a point of conflict, but Mexico may come to realize that the end of the remittance cornucopia was inevitable. Mexico can grow its own economy and create millions of jobs for its people by abandoning its socialist dogmas and   enterprises. If that happens, someday soon Mexican politicians will see the bitter medicine administered by Trump as a blessing in disguise.  Polls of   Mexicans who entered our country illegally reveal that the large majority of them do not intend to stay forever. Typically, upon arrival, they plan to get a job, send money home, and then return home to Mexico and enjoy a better life than what they left.   Mexicans naturally retain a love of the country of their birth â€”  and that love of country is certainly not a bad thing if you think of it as your true home.  If ten million Mexicans now in the United States became optimistic about Mexicoâ€™s future and returned home to fight corruption, build a better educational system and a stronger economy, that, too, would not be a bad thing.", "output": "1.

The Trump Nationalist Vision, Ascendant  Itâ€™s an obvious fact: Donald Trump hasnâ€™t even been sworn in as the 45th President, and yet, already, heâ€™s setting the national agenda. Through Twitter, other social media, and the occasional public appearance, heâ€™s still doing what he did throughout the presidential campaign â€”  dominating.  Only now, as he says, heâ€™s doing it not for himself, but for the American people.     In recent weeks, Trump has struck   deals with Carrier and Ford.  Hence this revealing January 3 headline: â€œChided by Trump, Ford scraps Mexico factory, adds Michigan jobs. â€ Heâ€™s also announced a $50 billion, 50, 000 jobs deal with Japanese investor Masayoshi Son and has just touted a new   plan from Fiat Chrysler.  Yet at the same time, Trump is using sticks, as well as carrots.  He has made it clear that any company that takes jobs out the country will be lambasted for doing so.  As he said in his January 11 press conference,  The word is now out, that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio . . . itâ€™s not going to happen that way anymore. And in that same press conference, he went after the pharmaceutical companies for charging too much.  And he had a   solution: â€œWhat we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry, because theyâ€™re getting away with murder. â€ And of course, he has chastised defense contractors Boeing and Lockheed, which he believes have been asking too much from the taxpayers. The result of this â€œtweet therapyâ€ has been an overhaul of thinking in Corporate America.  Surveying Trumpâ€™s new style of presidential bully pulpiteering, Reuters concludes, â€œCorporate leaders . . . can no longer focus only on maximizing shareholder value they must now also weigh national interest. â€ Yes, thatâ€™s correct: American business executives are now getting a crash course in economic patriotism they can no longer act as if they arenâ€™t citizens of this country â€”  or that other US citizens donâ€™t matter.  Because of Trump, they must now take into account the overall strength and   of the nation in which they reside.   And hereâ€™s the interesting thing: Trumpâ€™s     activism is also proving to be  .  Itâ€™s a win for all three sectors call it a national   .  And it only makes sense: If there are more American workers with big paychecks buying things and paying their fair share of taxes, thatâ€™s good both for American business and for Uncle Samâ€™s budget.  Indeed, according to the National Federation of Independent Business, small business optimism has â€œskyrocketed,â€ and consumer confidence is also up meanwhile, the dollar is up, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 2000 points since the election.  So itâ€™s fully evident that the American economy is responding positively to Trump as   .  And President Trump will be joined in his administration, of course, by a slew of other successful dealmakers.   Yes, itâ€™s interesting to think back on the old ways of the federal government, the   ways.  That is, the feds have been interventionist on so many matters for so long, and yet they were  almost entirely   when it came to good jobs and wages corporations were free to come and go â€”  mostly, go.  The message to employers was, in effect, Do whatever you want to your    workers, but you must, at all costs, protect wetlands, spotted owls, and the feelings of â€œprotected victimsâ€ and their free choice of bathrooms.  Thankfully, that strange and unfair policy choice by Uncle Sam â€”  to ignore the interests of the broad middle class while catering to ever more     â€”  seems to be coming to an end.   So itâ€™s possible, perhaps even likely, that under President Trump we will once again become a nation for all Americans â€”  even Middle Americans.  We could yet be the â€œcity on a hillâ€ that Ronald Reagan so eloquent described.  That is, a true   â€œTeam America,â€ united in its determination to work hard and do well, with US citizens coming first.  As Trump said in his press conference on Wednesday, his victory was â€œa movement like the world has never seen before . . . that was a beautiful thing on November 8. â€ 2. The Old Globalist Vision, Descendant  Of course, not everyone thinks that what happened on Election Day 2016 was a beautiful thing, because they have been living their lives according to a vision much different than Trumpâ€™s economic nationalism. Letâ€™s get specific.  We can start with Barack Obama for the last eight years, as we know, Obama never worried much about the middle class, or, for that matter, about America.  Instead, his eyes were on a different prize: the vision of a relentlessly globalized world, in which the US would fit in . . . somewhere.  Hereâ€™s how the 44th president expressed himself in his first inaugural address, back in 2009:  As the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.   That might be a nice thought to have in some academic ivory tower, but in the real world, thereâ€™s precious little evidence that the polyglot peoples of the planet agree on much of anything, let alone how to usher in a new era of peace.  Heck, even Obama, having received a Nobel Peace Prize for making nice speeches, immediately escalated that forlorn war in Afghanistan.  Yet still, in his dogmatically ideological mind,  he was determined to shrink American power so that it would â€œplay its roleâ€ in this new global order.  And so in April 2009, the president was at pains to deny that â€œAmerican exceptionalismâ€ was anything worth taking note of, let alone being proud of.   Instead, he snarked that â€œAmerican exceptionalismâ€ was an illusion, because all countries see themselves as exceptional.  Obamaâ€™s dismissiveness inspired one reporter to observe,  If all countries are â€œexceptional,â€ then none are, and to claim otherwise robs the word, and the idea of American exceptionalism, of any meaning. And yet again, Obamaâ€™s comments made perfect sense, if we see that his goal was to cubbyhole the United States as just another country on the world stage, somewhere between Uganda and Uzbekistan.  So of course, Obama devoted his first few months in office to a worldwide â€œapology tour,â€ although many say that it lasted, really, for his entire eight years in the White House.  John Fonte, a conservative critic of globalism at the Hudson Institute, calls this ideology â€œtransnational progressivism,â€ and it certainly defines the progressive worldview. Indeed, if we dig deeper, we can see that globalism is, in fact, a kind of religion. Everyone has heard, whether they wanted to or not, that 1971 John Lennon song, â€œImagine,â€ including these   lyrics:   Imagine thereâ€™s no countriesIt isnâ€™t hard to doNothing to kill or die forAnd no religion, too. This â€œLennonism,â€ to be sure, is shared by many around the world.  Thus itâ€™s little wonder that Obama made common cause with other globalists, including former British prime minister David Cameron, German chancellor Angela Merkel, and European Union chief   Juncker.  These are the people who presided over the creation, or the elevation, of various murky transnational enterprises, including the United Nations, the European Union, the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, aka, the Iran nuclear deal.  The common thread running through all these bureaucratic contraptions is the   â€œdemocracy deficit. â€  That is, in the mind of the elite, the fewer real people, including in the US, who get to vote on, or otherwise scrutinize, the doings of these bureaucracies, the better.    Indeed, itâ€™s also best, the elite thinks, if people never even learn the truth about whatâ€™s being done in their name.  We can cite, for example, the issue of refugees.  To globalists, itâ€™s a point of honor to accept refugees, even with the prospect of subsidizing forever, in unassimilated dependency.  So we can readily see that Germanyâ€™s Merkel is, in the globalist   hierarchy, the most â€œhonorable. â€  Yet, as we know, the Obama administration has done its best to keep up.  And if these   programs arenâ€™t popular with the public, well, the standard elite instinct is to mislead and deceive.  In the mind of these deceivers, itâ€™s all for the greater good because the ideal of the sacred â€œglobal villageâ€ is never better off if the â€œdeplorablesâ€ get to decide anything.   Itâ€™s been well documented that the US government has been hiding the truth about the crimes of refugees, the health of refugees, and even the actual number of refugees.  Is anyone in the Obama administration the least bit apologetic for these dishonest abuses?  Of course not.  And yet, of course, in light of the recent election results, in which   globalism was decisively rejected, we have to ask: Did the elite really think that they would get away with it?  Did they really think that people wouldnâ€™t notice what has been happening to their communities and neighborhoods?  The answer seems to be, â€œYesâ€ â€”  the Obamans truly believed that they could get way with it.  They thought that Trump would be buried by a blue demographic wave in 2016, and that Hillary Clinton would be continuing their favored globalist policies in 2017.  To which we can say: Perhaps the elite arenâ€™t as smart as they think they are.  And yet, of course, even after being booted out of power, the Obama globalists will enjoy a soft landing: Many of them will soon be working for some George   think tank, or pressure group.  And from those cushy perches, they will be able to keep up their â€œresistanceâ€ to Trump (more on this in the next two installments). Now we cite a second sacred item on the globalist agenda: international free trade.  And here we see, once again, that elite thinking on globalism has a way of turning a theory into a transcendentally moral first principle.  And itâ€™s been this way for a long time.   Back in 1846, the leading British free trader Richard Cobden declared,   that free trade would save the world:  I see in the   principle that which shall act on the moral world as the principle of gravitation in the universe â€”  drawing men together, thrusting aside the antagonism of race, and creed, and language, and uniting us in the bonds of eternal peace. Cobden was a capitalist, and capitalists are often   but, as we can see, thereâ€™s a dreamy, even giddy, utopianism in Cobdenâ€™s thinking.  And amazingly, it won the battle of public opinion in   Britain.  Interestingly, one contemporary of Cobdenâ€™s â€”  who was much   and decidedly not a capitalist â€”  nevertheless endorsed the same idea.  That would be Karl Marx, the founder of communism.  As a theoretical prognosticator, Marx may have had a mistaken view of what communism would become in the future, and yet, nevertheless, he was a shrewd observer of current events.   Marx could see that unchecked and unbalanced   capitalism would quickly pulverize cultures, traditions, even whole nations in an endless gale of creative destruction.  That is, individuals might be better off in some material ways, but, as a community, they would be atomized and unhinged.  In the meantime, Marx continued, left to their own devices, untrammeled free markets would  concentrate most of the wealth in the hands of speculators and other financialists.  And so a result, Marx concluded, the masses, in their vexation, would be ready to experiment with socialism and then communism.   With that   Red scenario in mind, Marx declared in a famous 1848 speech, â€œGentlemen, I am in favor of free trade. â€ Yet today, the most ardent proponents of free trade arenâ€™t   communists they are   globalists, and they are achingly sincere.  Some might be Democrats, some might be Republicans, some might think of themselves as liberal, some might identify as conservatives.  Yet what unites them all is a vision of a borderless world, with minimal restrictions on exports and imports.  (And, of course, minimal restrictions on the transit, also, of people.)  To be sure, some globalists, such as the EUâ€™s   Juncker, have turned globalism into a profitable ideology for years now, Juncker has been in the middle of efforts by his home country, Luxembourg, to become the worldâ€™s most   tax haven.  So yes, thereâ€™s plenty of   in globalism.   And yet at the same time, thereâ€™s more than that â€”  much more. 3. The Gospel of Globalism, Indeed, this globalist faith is so strong that one can fairly conclude that itâ€™s more than an ideology â€”  it must be a kind of theology.   As writer Fay Voshell suggested last September in American Thinker, globalism, for many, is a kind of transmuted Christianity. That is, globalism is a new kind of faith:   Replacing the beatific vision of Christianity is a new universal . . . an order in which human beingsâ€™ allegiance is to a global City of Men ruled by elite priests who act as gods for the masses.  Preachers of the globalist vision present an ersatz kingdom . . . The religion of globalism sees an earthly, utopian world order in which all men pay allegiance to elite priests who rule over a World City without national borders.  Sometimes the substitute beatific vision is expressed in terms of a â€œglobal village,â€ a mystical entity that takes the place of the family of God.  The globalistsâ€™ family of humanity is without distinction of country, tribe or creed. Those last words, â€œwithout distinction of country, tribe or creed,â€ take us right back to where we started â€”  with John Lennonâ€™s â€œImagine. â€  For the globalists, this vision is so powerful that itâ€™s easy to see how they  would be inspired to do exactly what they have done: open their borders, impose political correctness on their people, and transform their societies through vast   schemes.  Indeed, as we have seen, globalist political leaders are so committed to their beliefs that they  are even willing to risk losing elections, sacrificing their careers on the altar of their faith.  And thatâ€™s just what happened with the Brexit vote in June, which not only put Britain on a course to leave the European Union, but also cost David Cameron his high office at Number 10 Downing Street.  And here in the US in November, the same thing happened to Hillary Clinton â€”  and to Barack Obamaâ€™s legacy.  Given the passionate depths of globalist sentiments, itâ€™s little wonder that the elites took those defeats with bitter dismay.   In the United Kingdom, for example, the beginning of the angry globalist response was to put a permanent hex on the leader of Brexit, Nigel Farage.   And oh yes, you might have noticed: Here in the US, the elite is just as angry at Trump.  In the globalist mind, Farage and Trump arenâ€™t just enemies, they are heretics.  Maybe even, in a   sense, they are  .   So while Farage and Trump have won their respective political victories, the full fury of the elite has yet to be felt.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government has since 2014 tightened surveillance of non-profit groups, saying they were acting against India s national interests. Thousands of foreign-funded charities  licenses have been canceled for misreporting donations. Critics, however, say the government has used the foreign funding law as a tool to silence non-profit groups which have raised concerns about the social costs of India s rapid economic development.  The intelligence wing of India s home ministry last year drafted a note on Bloomberg Philanthropies, raising concerns that the foundation was running a campaign to  target  Indian tobacco businesses and  aggressively  lobby against the sector. Though the three-page note, reviewed by Reuters, said the Bloomberg initiative s  claimed intention to free India of tobacco cannot be faulted  given the known risks from tobacco, it highlighted the sector s importance, noting it brings in nearly $5 billion in annual revenue for governments, and provides a livelihood for millions of people.  Foreign interests making foreign contributions ... for purposes of lobbying against an established economic activity raises multiple concerns,  the note said, including, it said, an  adverse economic impact  on 35 million people. The June 3, 2016 note, marked  SECRET  and circulated to top government officials, including in Modi s office, has not previously been reported. The probe continued until at least April this year, another government document showed. Rebecca Carriero, a spokeswoman for Michael Bloomberg and New York-based Bloomberg Philanthropies, declined to comment as they were unaware of any investigation. A home ministry spokesman said  queries which relate to security agencies cannot be answered.  Modi s office did not respond to an email seeking comment. The ministry s note was one of the factors behind the rejection of a foreign funding license renewal of at least one Bloomberg-funded India charity last October, said a senior government official aware of the investigation. Michael Bloomberg, one of the world s richest people and a former New York City Mayor, has committed nearly $1 billion to support global tobacco control efforts. One of his focus countries is India, where tobacco kills 900,000 people a year. Other than funding Indian NGOs, Bloomberg s charity has in the past worked on improving road safety and supported federal tobacco-control efforts. In 2015, Modi called Michael Bloomberg a  friend , and the two agreed on working together on India s ambitious plan to build so-called smart cities. The home ministry note said the Bloomberg charity successfully lobbied for the introduction of bigger health warnings on cigarette packs,  contrary  to the recommendations of a parliamentary panel. While the panel called for the size of warnings to be more than doubled to 50 percent of a pack s surface area, the health ministry sought a higher figure of 85 percent. Despite protests from India s $10 billion cigarette industry, the Supreme Court last year ordered manufacturers to follow the more stringent health ministry rules. That, the note said, was the first of the three-phase Bloomberg campaign targeting India s tobacco industry. It did not explain how exactly the Bloomberg charity lobbied.

What was at stake was whether Macron s LREM and allies would win enough seats to give him a three-fifths majority vote in both houses of parliament, which he needs for constitutional reforms, including plans to overhaul parliament.     The vote, in which about 171 of the Senate s 348 seats were up for grabs, consolidated the Senate s existing conservative majority. But the Socialist party, which was crushed in last June s legislative elections, did well in the vote, provisional results provided by the French Senate showed. The results could complicate Macron s plans for constitutional reforms and come as his popularity is declining, just four months after his election in May. His approval ratings have dropped considerably in opinion polls, dragged down by labor reforms and planned budget cuts, including a decrease in housing aid for students.     LREM, which hoped to win 40-50 Senators, ended up securing 23, and will be counting on alliances with lawmakers from other parties to back the government on a case by case basis.  The Senate s conservative majority is now composed of some 150 members of The Republicans party, confirming the Senate as a counterweight to Macron, even if the National Assembly, where Macron has a clear majority, has the final say on legislation.  Voters clearly showed they wanted a parliamentary counterweight, which is in my view vital to a balanced democracy,  Gerard Larcher, the President of the French Senate said in a public address. Macron s LREM was not expected to win a majority partly because of the electoral system. In elections for the Senate, only mayors and regional councilors and not the general public vote and Macron has plans that are unpopular with many local councilors. A number of local officials are unhappy with his plans to cut subsidies to local authorities. Jean Leonetti, a former The Republicans minister said on Twitter:  First setback for Emmanuel Macron . It was not immediately clear if Macron will be able to secure a three-fifths majority in both houses of parliament as it might require negotiations with other groups, including some members of The Republicans party.

Shot mostly before Trumpâ€™s election, it features the Republican candidate on the campaign trail promising to abolish environmental regulations and boost the coal and oil industries. At one point Trump tells a rally: â€œWe need some global warming â€” itâ€™s freezing!â€ But with legal and political obstacles, Gore said Trump would be unable to stop the momentum that would shift society away from fossil fuels. â€œWe now know after four months of the Trump administration, no one person, not even a president, can stop the climate movement,â€ Gore told a news conference at the French film festival. â€œThe courts have blocked parts of what President Trump has attempted and the Congress has refused to act on other parts of his agenda.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: LONDON  â€”   Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence agent who prepared the dossier on Donald J. Trumpâ€™s supposed activities in Russia, has gone underground. The strange story of the dossier, which United States intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. Senator John McCain and many journalists have had for weeks, if not months, and which Mr. Trump presumably must have known about, appears to have had personal consequences for Mr. Steele. According to neighbors and news reports, Mr. Steele hurriedly left his home in Surrey, a county southwest of London, on Wednesday to avoid attention or possible retribution once his identity as the author of the dossier was revealed, first by The Wall Street Journal. The Journal reported that Mr. Steele had declined its interview requests because the subject was â€œtoo hot. â€ Mr. Steele, 52, was a longstanding officer with MI6, the British equivalent of the C. I. A. serving in Paris and Moscow in the 1990s before retiring. In 2009, he started a private research firm, Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd. with Christopher Burrows, now 58. Mr. Burrows has refused to confirm or deny that Mr. Steele and Orbis wrote the memos that made up the dossier, initially under contract to a Washington firm paid to dig into harmful matters from Mr. Trumpâ€™s past. Mr. Burrowsâ€™s profile page on LinkedIn describes him as a former counselor in the Foreign Office, with postings in Brussels and New Delhi in the early 2000s. Diplomatic postings are sometimes used to provide cover for intelligence agents. Mr. Steeleâ€™s profile on LinkedIn gives no specifics about his career. He is known in British intelligence circles for his knowledge of the intricate web of   companies and associates that control Russia. Mr. Steele, as a known former MI6 agent, was thought not to have gone to Russia in his investigations but to have used contacts inside and outside the country to prepare the dossier, which United States intelligence agencies have said they cannot substantiate. But the file was used to prepare a   appendix to the intelligence presentation American officials gave to Mr. Trump last Friday. Mr. Trump has denied the allegations in the dossier in the sharpest terms, and called them â€œfake news. â€ Russia has denied that it holds any compromising material on Mr. Trump. John Sipher, who retired from the C. I. A. in 2014 after 28 years with the agency, described Mr. Steele as having a good reputation and â€œsome credibility. â€ Mr. Sipher was stationed in Moscow in the 1990s, and then ran the C. I. A. â€™s Russia program for three years, according to an interview he gave to PBS NewsHour. He now works at CrossLead, a   technology company. â€œI have confidence that the F. B. I. is going to follow this through,â€ Mr. Sipher said. â€œMy nervousness is that these kind of things are going to dribble and drabble out for the next several years and cause a real problem for this administration going forward. â€ An investigator for a business research firm in London similar to Orbis, who knows the work of the company but who has met Mr. Steele only briefly, said he was not impressed by the dossier. â€œI have a lot of experience in this world,â€ he said. â€œIf I were the client, I would throw it back and say, â€˜Whereâ€™s the evidence guys? I canâ€™t use this.â€™ â€ The investigator, who asked for anonymity because he did not want to discuss publicly the work of a competitor, said that â€œall intel has to be caveated. â€ â€œMaybe they went to a usually reliable source,â€ he added, â€œbut thereâ€™s no explanation about the credibility of these sources. â€ He continued, â€œMaybe sometimes sources want to tell the investigators what their clients want to hear. â€ Referring to companies like Orbis and his own, he said: â€œUsually your job would be to stop clients from dealing with corrupt, questionable counterparts in a   country like Russia, but this same network could be put to useâ€ to compile reports like the one on Mr. Trump. â€œThereâ€™s a risk that maybe the sources fed questionable intelligence, knowing that it would do more damage to Trumpâ€™s enemies than to Trump,â€ the investigator suggested. Orbisâ€™s website says that it was â€œfounded by former British intelligence professionals. â€ Based in Grosvenor Gardens, near Victoria Station in London, the company says it has a â€œsophisticated investigative capabilityâ€ and mounts â€œ  operationsâ€ and â€œcomplex, often   investigations. â€ According to the website, it also offers â€œ  source reporting on business and politics at all levels,â€ and â€œdraws on extensive experience at boardroom level in government, multilateral diplomacy and international business to develop bespoke solutions for clients. â€ Mr. Steele and Orbis have previously investigated corruption at FIFA, the governing body of world soccer. In October, David Corn of Mother Jones magazine wrote about the dossier and described his conversations with Mr. Steele, whom he did not identify by name or nationality.

The government is seeking to dissolve Kem Sokha s Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), arguing he and his party sought to topple the government, a move which would help Prime Minister Hun Sen extend his 32-year rule at the next election in 2018.. The U.S. State Department said Washington was  deeply concerned  by parliament s passage of the amendments and if ratified  would effectively disenfranchise the millions of people who voted for the CNRP in the 2013 and 2017 elections .  Genuine competition is essential to democracy and to the legitimacy of the 2018 national elections,  U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement released in Cambodia on Tuesday.  We urge government officials to consider the serious implications of their recent actions. We renew our call that the leader of the CNRP, Kem Sokha, be released from prison.  A spokesman for Cambodia s ruling party said the U.S State Department s statement was weak and Cambodia was on the right track to towards a free and fair election next year.  Their tone is lighter. Before, they would bully so this means we are on the right path towards democracy and rule of law,  Sok Eysan, a parliamentarian from Hun Sen s ruling Cambodian People s Party (CPP), told Reuters. Cambodia s National Assembly voted on Monday to change election laws to re-distribute seats to other parties in parliament within seven days of a party being dissolved. Lawyers from the interior ministry filed a lawsuit on Oct. 6 to demand the dissolution the CNRP, after Kem Sokha was charged with treason following his Sept. 3 arrest. The government has said CNRP conspired with foreign advisors to topple the government, citing a 2013 video clip showing Kem Sokha talking about a plan to take power with the help of Americans. Half of opposition figures fled abroad in September and early October as Hun Sen moves to tighten his grip on power by silencing critics in the lead-up to the national election. Mu Sochua, deputy president of the opposition CNRP, who fled Cambodia earlier this month in fear of arrest, called on political parties to only contest the 2018 election if it is free and fair.  All conditions for free fair and inclusive elections must be met,  Mu Sochua told Reuters.  Any party that want to compete to win CPP must only do so if these conditions are met.", "output": "1.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last month that the U.S. central bank was getting closer to raising interest rates, possibly as early as September, saying that the Fed sees the economy as close to meeting its goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed raised interest rates last December for the first time in nearly a decade, and at that time projected four more hikes in 2016. The Fed later scaled back that projection to two rate hikes this year in the wake of a slowdown in global growth and continued financial market volatility. Trump, during the primary campaign, as he took on 16 Republican rivals, had called Yellenâ€™s tenure â€œhighly politicalâ€ and said the Fed should raise interest rates but would not do so for â€œpolitical reasons.â€ The Fed has been a target of some conservative critics in the U.S. Congress, who say the bank risked sparking inflation with its easy monetary policies in response to the global financial crisis.

For all the noise, demonstrations, walkouts and silent protests, the divisions on display here as Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton for president do not appear to present a major threat to her candidacy, paling in contrast to intramural battles that have doomed nominees in the past and that threaten Donald J. Trump today. Even as Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has sought to take advantage of the acrimony by appealing directly to the supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign has methodically used the first three days of this convention to win over those supporters. Almost on the hour, the lights in the convention hall have dimmed to present â€œTrump in His Own Words,â€ a series of short video clips that show Mr. Trump offering contentious views on, for example, women and pregnancy in the workplace, advertisements clearly aimed at Sanders backers at the gathering. â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to be a permanent division,â€ said Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a Democrat who lost his own bitter primary campaign for president against Bill Clinton in 1992 and whose state delegation has been a hotbed of Sanders support. â€œThe stakes are high. The issues are very sharp. There will be a real convergence around the core ideas of the campaign. â€ Despite a modest walkout after the roll call and a march on the convention hall by Sanders supporters as Mr. Clinton spoke on Tuesday, the convention has offered each night a broad   of the party leadership that has allied behind Mrs. Clinton: speeches of support from President Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Howard Dean, whose 2004 candidacy for president recalls the one Mr. Sanders ran. â€œThe Sanders people walked out last night  â€”   there were less than 100 of them!â€ Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate minority leader, said. Mr. Sanders was given a   speech to make the case to his supporters that it was time to rally behind Mrs. Clinton. At the behest of the Clinton campaign, he moved to nominate her by acclamation to make it appear unanimous, just as she had done for Barack Obama in 2008. Even before the convention began, polls showed that a substantial majority of Mr. Sandersâ€™s backers said they would vote for Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump, and if history is any guide, those numbers will only grow as Election Day approaches. Todd Gitlin, a historian, said both parties have over the years faced divisions that were deeper and that festered through Election Day, including when Hubert Humphrey emerged from a Democratic primary contest with Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy to lose to Richard M. Nixon in 1968, as well as when Barry Goldwater, after a divided Republican convention four years earlier, lost to Lyndon B. Johnson. The current Republican Party may also fall into that category, given how many powerful Republicans have refused to back Mr. Trump. â€œIn 1968, the cleavage in the party was far deeper than it is now,â€ Mr. Gitlin said. â€œThe hatred in the streets between the Humphrey supporters and the supporters of Kennedy and McCarthy was so intense. People like me didnâ€™t vote. I donâ€™t think we are looking at anything like that today. â€ Which is not to say that this is going to be an easy walk down the aisle. In interviews, Democrats said they worried less about Sanders supporters voting for Mr. Trump than about them not turning out at all, or casting votes for, say, the Libertarian Party or Green Party candidates. â€œI think there will be some loss of votes to   candidates,â€ Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said. Former President George Bush has long blamed his   defeat in 1992 on the   candidacy of Ross Perot. Ralph Nader, who ran for president in 2000 on a   line, cost Al Gore, a Democrat, the election against Mr. Bushâ€™s son, in the view of many party members. Mr. Sandersâ€™s support for Mrs. Clinton crystallized only recently. Well into the summer, he was still making a vigorous case against her  â€”   on issues like trade and what he described as her sympathies to Wall Street  â€”   drawing loud cheers and hardening opposition to Mrs. Clinton at his rallies. â€œLong after it was clear he was not going to be a nominee, he was attacking her as an instrument of Wall Street,â€ Mr. Greenberg said. The reconciliation was no doubt complicated even more this week when Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a longtime adviser to the Clintons, strongly suggested to an interviewer that Mrs. Clinton would change her position again on the   Partnership Treaty and try to put it in effect once she was in the White House. Mr. Sanders has made opposition to the treaty, a pact with the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations, a central part of his campaign, forcing Mrs. Clinton, who once supported the treaty, to publicly disavow it. In this context, even a plea from Mr. Sanders to his supporters to embrace Mrs. Clinton may not be enough, at least for some of them. â€œShe really needs to do actual concrete things to show that she recognizes what a dire situation our country and world is in,â€ said Lisa Flythe, a Sanders delegate from Brooklyn who works as a   representative. â€œShe needs to take concrete actions to enact a progressive agenda from workersâ€™ rights to eliminating T. P. P. â€ At one point on Wednesday night, Sanders supporters, wearing green shirts and scattered across the hall, broke into loud chants of â€œNo more war,â€ drowning out Leon E. Panetta, who was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the defense secretary under Mr. Obama, as he praised Mrs. Clintonâ€™s foreign policy credentials. Still, some of Mr. Sandersâ€™s supporters said that given the choice, they were ready to support her. â€œI think itâ€™s appropriate to tell the Bernie supporters to support Hillary because of the alternative,â€ said Taz Tally, a Democratic delegate from Homer, Alaska, â€œand in my view, if you choose not to vote, itâ€™s basically a vote for Mr. Trump, which is scary. â€ Governor Brown, who endorsed Mrs. Clinton in the final days of the Democratic primary in California, said he did not think people who voted for Mr. Sanders would support Mr. Trump. â€œTrump is too antithetical to anything that Sanders people talk about,â€ he said. â€œThereâ€™s a similarity on trade, but immigration, the N. R. A. Trump is a real outlier. And while he picked up the nomination of the Republican Party, heâ€™s not close to the mainstream that would make crossover likely from Democrats to Republicans. â€ In the end, the party divisions appear to be, as they have been through much of the campaign, as generational as they are ideological. â€œThere will continue to be a hard left, some of whom are naÃ¯ve,â€ Mr. Gitlin, the historian, said, referring to Sanders backers. â€œThey are young. This is their first crusade. They feel betrayed. They were true believers: They believed that Bernie was the man and Bernie was transformative. They were in this for victory. The feeling of betrayal is very real. â€", "output": "1. True"}

The Italian region of Lombardy, the country s industrial engine and home to its financial capital Milan, is holding a referendum on Sunday for more autonomy, an outcome its once-proudly secessionist leader hopes will lure more investment. That could come at the expense of Catalonia, which is a rival to Lombardy in the race to attract employers fleeing another painful European divorce, Brexit. The two regions are competing to host Europe s drugs regulator which must leave the UK and find a new home inside the European Union.  We are not Catalonia,  said Lombardy President Roberto Maroni, overlooking Milan from his glass-walled office on the 36th floor of the region s recently built headquarters.  We remain inside the Italian nation with more autonomy while Catalonia wants to become the 29th state of the European Union. We, no. Not for now.  He speaks of Catalonia as a competitor in some respects but says he is not deliberately courting its firms.  We are not cheering because firms are fleeing Catalonia. We will see what happens but I haven t had any requests yet from Catalan firms.  Maroni is a leading member of Lega Nord, which began in the 1990s to campaign for an independent state of Padania, stretching across Italy s north, roughly following the Po river from around Lombardy in the west to Venice in the east. Lega Nord no longer actively campaigns for secession but as the ruling party in Lombardy and in the Veneto region around Venice, it is holding referendums in both for greater autonomy, including a better financial deal from the central government. A  yes  vote would not be binding on Rome, but Maroni said it would give him a strong mandate to negotiate a better deal.  It s obvious that the more negotiating power I have, the more money I can manage to bring home,  he said. Rome says the referendum is unnecessary, though permitted under Italy s constitution, which allows regions to open talks for more autonomy. Italy s ruling Democratic Party is also neutral on the issue, though at least one of the party s mayors in Lombardy is calling for a  yes  vote. Like Catalonia, Lombardy makes up a fifth of the national economy and complains that the center is draining its finances. But unlike Catalonia, where hundreds of firms have shifted headquarters to other regions of Spain since an Oct. 1 independence referendum there, Lombardy s boss is taking a softer line and using his autonomy push as an investment pitch. Maroni says Lombardy pays 54 billion euros ($64 billion) more in taxes to Rome each year than it receives from the center. He wants to reduce that difference by half. Maroni says he would spend some of that money on research and development, nurturing family-owned businesses and start-ups   and tax holidays to attract big international firms. For example, he said, he could tell big multinationals looking to invest in Europe:  You know that if you come to Milan, for two or three years I won t make you pay taxes.  Rome, though, is in no position to allow its most economically powerful region such a windfall without risking economic collapse in the already-poor south, experts say.  It s a zero-sum game,  said Professor Luca Ricolfi, an expert on federalism at the University of Turin. Gian Claudio Bressa, junior minister for regional affairs in Rome, said it was not a matter of just handing back money. Regions must show they can take over public services from the national government and do a better job at providing them. Only then are more funds allocated to a newly autonomous region, to help it fund those additional services.  Italy is a unitary state based on mutual fiscal solidarity among regions,  Bressa said.  In order to get more money from the central state, Lombardy should demonstrate that the services offered are better if compared to those provided by the state itself. If 27 billion euros were to be used to fund something different from services, Italy could not survive of course.  Even if there is a large  yes  vote in Sunday s referendums, experts do not expect quick or dramatic change. Lombardy would consider it a victory if it managed to pick up a few more responsibilities and around 1-2 billion euros in additional funds, said the University of Turin s Ricolfi. Politically, though, it could inflame tensions between the rich north and poor south, and weaken the seams of a nation that was a collection of small regional states, speaking a variety of dialects, until unification in the 19th century.  Once you open up the issue of what the northern regions pay, then I expect a backlash in southern Italy,  said Giovanni Orsina, history professor at Rome s Luiss-Guido Carli University.

In his first call with Netanyahu since taking office on Friday, Trump stressed his â€œunprecedented commitment to Israelâ€™s security.â€ â€œThe president and the prime minister agreed to continue to closely consult on a range of regional issues, including addressing the threats posed by Iran,â€ the White House said in a statement. Trump also said peace between Israel and the Palestinians could only be negotiated between the two parties, but that the United States would work with Israel to achieve that goal. Relations between Israel and the Obama administration ended on a contentious note, when the United States declined to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a halt to Israeli settlement-building. The readout from the White House did not include any mention of moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, an action that would likely spark anger in the Arab world. Earlier on Sunday, the White House said it was only in the early stages of talks to fulfill Trumpâ€™s campaign pledge to relocate the embassy. â€œWe are at the very beginning stages of even discussing this subject,â€ White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in a statement. Aides said no announcement of an embassy move was imminent. Washingtonâ€™s embassy is in Tel Aviv, as are most foreign diplomatic posts. Israel calls Jerusalem its eternal capital, but Palestinians also lay claim to the city as part of an eventual Palestinian state. Both sides cite biblical, historical and political claims. Any decision to break with the status quo is likely to prompt protests from U.S. allies in the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt. Washington relies on those countries for help in fighting the Islamic State militant group, which the new U.S. president has said is a priority. The U.S. Congress passed a law in 1995 describing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and saying it should not be divided, but successive Republican and Democratic presidents have used their foreign policy powers to maintain the embassy in Tel Aviv and to back negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on the status of Jerusalem. In early December, then-President Barack Obama renewed the presidential waiver on an embassy move until the beginning of June. It is unclear whether Trump would be able to legally override it and go ahead with relocation of the embassy. U.S. diplomats say that, despite the U.S. legislation, Washingtonâ€™s foreign policy is in practice broadly aligned with that of the United Nations and other major powers, which do not view Jerusalem as Israelâ€™s capital and do not recognize Israelâ€™s annexation of Arab East Jerusalem after its capture in the 1967 Middle East war.   Israel approved building permits on Sunday for hundreds of homes in three East Jerusalem settlements in expectation that Trump will row back on the previous administrationâ€™s criticism of such projects.", "output": "1.

Trump is planning to increase U.S. defense spending by $54 billion next year. But a series of recent reports by the Defense Department Inspector General and the Government Accountability OfficeÂ say that Pentagon accounting systems will struggle to track how the money is spent.  The reports found that the Pentagon remains unable to accurately track its $591 billion annual budget and experiences billions of dollars in accounting gaps and errors each year despite two decades of reform efforts.Â Taken together, the reports show that many of the endemic accounting problems exposed in a 2013 Reuters investigative series remain in place.  â€œThese deficiencies not only affect (the Department of Defenseâ€™s) ability to have auditable financial statements,â€ a Feb. 9 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found, â€œthey also affect its ability to make sound decisions on missions and operations.â€  A spokesman for the White Houseâ€™s Office of Management Budget (OMB) said he was confident that Defense Secretary James Mattis would properly spend the additional funds.  â€œThe need to replenish our military and bolster American security is unquestioned and an important priority of this president,â€ OMB Communications Director John Czwartacki said in a statement. â€œWe believe Secretary Mattis will deploy all of his resources in the most effective and efficient way possible.â€  Critics of wasteful Pentagon spending say increasing the Defense Department budget is unwise when the department is unable to account for what it already has.  â€œItâ€™s ludicrous,â€ said Mandy Smithberger, director of the Straus Military Reform Project in Washington. â€œReform isnâ€™t going to happen as long as the spigot is turned on.â€  The Pentagonâ€™s continued accounting problems are drawing particular scrutiny now because the Defense Department faces a congressionally mandated legal deadline of Sept. 30, 2017, to become ready for its first audit ever. Unlike every other U.S. government department, the Pentagon has never undergone an audit because its financial records are in such disarray.  A spokesman for the Defense Department comptrollerâ€™s office said he is confident it will meet the deadline.  â€œThe Department is committed and on track to be ready to undergo a full financial statement audit in (fiscal year) 2018,â€ Lieutenant Colonel Eric D. Badger said in an email.  At the same time Trump proposes to boost defense spending, he has called for deep cuts to other areas, a White House summary of his proposed 2018 budget shows. Whether Congress will accept or reject Trumpâ€™s proposals is unclear.  Trump calls for cutting the State Departmentâ€™s budget by $10.1 billion, or 28%. Among other things, U.S. payments to support the United Nations would be cut.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would take a particularly big hit. Trump would cut $2.6 billion, or 31%, of its budget. The White House document says the budget would eliminate more than 50 EPA programs, and cut EPAâ€™s research and development budget by $233 million, or 52%. The budget for grants to states for lead clean-up would be cut by 30% to $9.8 million.  The recent watchdog reports on the Defense Department found that it lacks a unified, functioning accounting system. As Reuters reported in its 2013 series, the Pentagon has hundreds of independent systems, built ad hoc and some dating from the 1970s, that are riddled with errors and incapable of sharing accurate data.  Billions of dollars disappear from accounting records. The military has spent large sums building new systems meant to solve the problem, but so far they have not.  AÂ March 16 Defense Department Inspector General reportÂ saidÂ the NavyÂ could not find any records to back up how it had spent $866 million inÂ the first quarter ofÂ 2016 inÂ U.S. military operations in Afghanistan.Â The report said that as a result, there was no way to know what the money actually was used for.  A Navy spokeswoman, Lieutenant Kara YingLing, referred Reuters to the Navyâ€™s official response to the report, which said the Navy agreed with the Inspector Generalâ€™s conclusions but said its accounting problems will not be fixed until it begins using a new computer system in 2019. YingLing said the Navy is â€œon trackâ€ to help the Pentagon meet its Sept. 30 audit deadline.  The Feb. 9 GAO report said the Pentagonâ€™s continued bookkeeping errors affect the federal government as a whole. Defense spending makes up such a large part of the federal budget that the departmentâ€™s unreliable data skews accounting for the entire U.S. government, the GAO said.  The report noted that the Defense Department has been on the GAOâ€™s list of â€œHigh Riskâ€ entities that represent threats to the federal governmentâ€™s financial well-being since 1995. The report said the Pentagon has remained on the list because of â€œlong-standing deficiencies with its financial management systems.â€  The GAO report noted that the Pentagon had hired large independent accounting firms for each of the military services to try to help them meet the Sept. 30 audit deadline. But the report said the firms have found so many problems that the ability of the Pentagon to meet the deadline remains in doubt.  A separate Defense Department Inspector General report issued on March 23, 2017, found that the Army continues to be unable to balance its checkbook. The report concluded that the problem for the Army grew worse in 2016.  The report said that for October 2015, the Army had 177,921 discrepancies. The monthly numbers rose steadily to 790,551 for June 2016. The report did not give dollar amounts for those months.  Army spokesman Wayne Hall said the number of discrepancies continued to increase in 2017 because planned fixes to computer systems have not yet been made. He said the Army is working on building more reliable systems.  The report said that because rules require that the Armyâ€™s numbers exactly match in monthly reports to the Treasury, the Army and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service must find a way to make them match. Their solution was to enter made-up numbers to make it appear falsely that the Armyâ€™s numbers do match.  The report said that for March 2016, there were $1.9 billion in such â€œforced balance entries.â€ Hall said the Army must make the numbers match under federal rules.  In separate reports, the Inspector General found that other military services have also had problems balancing their financial numbers with the Treasuryâ€™s. Accountants interviewed by Reuters said that such large discrepancies would be considered accounting fraud in the corporate world.  Badger, the spokesman for the Defense Department comptrollerâ€™s office, said any errors by the military services were unintentional.  â€œWe strongly oppose any accusation of intentionally misrepresenting our books,â€ Badger said in an email. â€œMany manual accounting adjustments are often caused by the ineffective design of legacy business or financial systems.â€  Trump has said the $54 billion in increased defense spending will send a â€œmessage to the world in these dangerous times of American strength, security and resolve.â€ Trump has also vowed to negotiate cheaper contracts with defense contractors, a problem also cited in recent watchdog reports.  In a March 2016 report, the Inspector General found that the Air Force had spent â€œbillionsâ€ on a contract to maintain one type of jet engine, without first getting any idea of a fair price.  The open-ended contract, with a guaranteed profit margin regardless of cost, was awarded in 2011. The report said that before signing the contract the Air Force obtained no data on the actual cost of the repairs and how the costs compared to private-sector rates.  The exact amount of the contract was redacted from the report. The Inspector General has not ruled on a March 2016 Freedom of Information Act request filed by Reuters that asked for the redacted information to be made public.", "output": "1. True"}

S. A. colors day and wore red, white, and blue and U. S.   clothing to last weekâ€™s game against North High School.  But the effort was deemed â€œcontroversialâ€ by members of North High because their school has a â€œdiverseâ€ student body. â€œA lot of people were very upset about it,â€ North sophomore DeNasja Spencer told CBS affiliate KCCI TV. â€œEven if that was their theme for the game, I feel like they should have switched that because everyone knows North is a more diverse school,â€ she added. On Facebook, a Valley High alum named Ty Leggett slammed the students. â€œThis is an example of BLATANT racism,â€ he wrote. â€œALL participating should have been pulled and banned from ALL VHS extracurricular events for the remainder of the year! As a parent, Iâ€™d be mortified that my son or daughter thought this way, acted in this fashion and refrained from taking a stand against this 21st century inexcusable behavior!â€ Des Moines North coach Chad Ryan claimed he didnâ€™t want to â€œjudge those young people not knowing their motive,â€ but went on to say, â€œItâ€™s been good for us, as a school. They learn from each other about people with different cultures and backgrounds  â€”   and we try to use it as an educational piece. â€ This isnâ€™t the first time Valley has sponsored a patriotic day. Valley High fans reportedly wore patriotic colors during a football game against rival Dowling Catholic this year as well. â€œWe had a USA theme, which weâ€™ve done many times in the past,â€ Valley freshman Dayna Dunnwald told the media. â€œItâ€™s really sad, and I hope everyone can resolve it in the end because no one at Valley meant it in that way. And it was just for fun. â€ Another student, Melissa   was disgusted by the attacks on her school, â€œNow we canâ€™t wear USA stuff without making someone upset? Oh please  â€¦    . â€ Despite the past patriotic events, Valley High Schoolâ€™s student leadership members apologized to North Highâ€™s principal. â€œIt has been brought to our attention that the decision by the Valley High School student section to wear U. S. A. apparel at our game last night was offensive to members of your community and fan base,â€ the student letter read. â€œWe are deeply sorry if we have offended anyone in any way. We have traditionally dressed in such a fashion for great games such as the one last night. Everyone here at Valley has immense respect not only for your team and players but for your community as a whole.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: LACADONIE, Haiti  â€”   When the rain comes at night in these distant mountains, the people flee what homes they have left. They race down hills threaded with stones and ragged palm branches, the earth the color of rust. They arrive at a cave carved into the hillside, the only sanctuary left after the storm. It is a holy place now, having saved hundreds of villagers during the worst of Hurricane Matthew, when nature tore their homes to the ground. It is still the only thing to protect them. For four days and nights, they huddled in its womb before emerging, frightened the hurricane might return. They slept on a floor of stacked boulders near the caveâ€™s mouth, lighting small fires for warmth and light. When they left, they salvaged enough to shield them from the sun, a few corroded sheets of zinc and scattered wooden beams. But when it rains they return to the cave, their shacks unable to keep the water out. And despite the odor and humidity, the unforgiving crags and profound darkness, they are thankful. â€œIt is our house that God created when we most needed it,â€ said Destine Jean, one of the villagers who first alerted the government of the closest town, Beaumont, to the people living in caves. â€œWithout this cave, a lot of people would have died. This is the only shelter we have. â€ For much of the world, Haiti is known more as a crisis than a country. Disaster, whether   or natural, has come to define the nation, where progress is often just a prelude to another step back. Dictators, corrupt officials and international meddling have competed with earthquakes and hurricanes to destabilize the country. There is a mean echo to the hurricaneâ€™s fallout this time around. After the 2010 earthquake flattened the capital and its surroundings, the struggle to get hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of tent cities and back into homes defined the nationâ€™s recovery. Now, schools and hospitals are again overflowing with the displaced, people whose homes are so gutted that leaving them makes more sense than staying. Where there is no shelter, residents are stripped to bare survival and forced to find their own way, even in caves. Officials in Beaumont say there are at least six caves they know of like this one, sheltering a total of 550 people living amid the   alps of the countryâ€™s southwest. It was not until leaders like Mr. Jean gradually made their way down to seek help that officials even realized the people were living in caves. The mayor of Beaumont, Alexis Faveur, shook his head in disbelief as he described the damage left by the hurricane this month, and the deplorable circumstances it reduced them to. He dispatches workers every few days to check on the villages, sending them on a climb of several hours, bearing bags of rice, beans, pasta and cooking oil. But there was no space for any more survivors in Beaumont the shelters are already overcrowded. â€œThe only place they can seek shelter is the cave,â€ he said, seated at a desk in his office, with   windows and no electricity. â€œThere are no more houses there. â€ The village of Lacadonie embodies the very worst of what this hurricane has left behind. Families scour for crops spared by the rain and scavenge the hillsides for plantains and beans not yet turned. A woman cooks rancid goat meat for her children, rinsing the blackened flesh with sour orange to cut the smell. Families mourn their dead in nighttime rituals, the spirits excised without being counted in a formal registry. Residents have started the hard work of rebuilding, fitting together the broken pieces of their homes and lives without a trace of  . Most estimate it will be years before they can afford to restore their residences, even to the humble state they were in before. For now, they will make do with far more modest accommodations. The first home to be rebuilt after the storm belonged to Lâ€™Anise Nazaire, who owns the lands where the cave is. If God saved the people with the cave, villagers say, then Ms. Nazaire was his messenger. A slight    whose shyness belies her courage, Ms. Nazaire risked her life to implore people to flee, delegating the task of saving her own mother to neighbors so that she could race up the mountain and warn others. She led them to the cave and the soaring cathedral of stalagmites at its base, where thick bands of light issue from an opening above. Many risked the steep descent to feel the sunlight during their stay. â€œAfter God, she gave us life,â€ Celor Montuna, a skeletal    farmer, said of Ms. Nazaire. â€œShe came and saved us. â€ During the storm, they watched through the mouth of the cave as the wind and rain sowed destruction, carrying entire trees past the entrance like leaves tossed on a breeze. â€œI thought Jesus was coming,â€ said Ms. Nazaire, pausing for a moment before breaking into a fit of laughter. For all the gratitude, she claims no glory. The second phase of survival leaves no time for victory laps. In her newly constructed home, a jigsaw puzzle of retrofitted planks, thatched tinder and rescued roofing, everyone is busy. â€œMy life would be worthless without the others,â€ she said. â€œWithout them, I would be dead myself. â€ In the cleared patch of land where her family lives, her mother, Elaide Fracile, shucked dried beans from a tangle of pods, gathered hastily from their spoiled fields. Her   played in her lap as she sorted through the remaining food, plucking out beans more by sense than sight. Her eyes are a milky blue, clouded by cataracts, her skin luminous and smooth. She says she is 100 years old. She is old enough to remember the last time a hurricane like Matthew upended life, and cannot help but register historyâ€™s echo. â€œI had a child with me that was 15 days old when Hurricane Hazel struckâ€ in 1954, she said, handing a small black bean to the infant. â€œHere I am again with this little one. â€ The child, abandoned by her mother, now belongs to her, Ms. Fracile said. They were together, in the same place, when Hurricane Matthew struck. Her son carried her on his back to the cave. â€œIâ€™ve survived four storms,â€ she said. â€œBut none have killed people like this one. â€ She beamed at her daughter, Ms. Nazaire. â€œIt would have been worse without the cave,â€ she said. â€œGod has not abandoned us. â€ Neighbors have come to one anotherâ€™s aid, sharing food and resources  â€”   the valor of a   community where the missing are known by name. A week after the storm, a goat herder, Jean Robert, his animals long since dead and rotting in the piercing sun, distributed what meat he had. Lithome   a father of six children, claimed a leg blackened by rot for his family. He carted the meat to his wife, who prepared it in the yard of their shattered home as the sun set over the ridgeline. The stench wafted over the village, a putrid essence of death detectable in just about every remote reach of the region. The busy work of staving off starvation occupied Mr.  â€™s family. Father and son plucked dried corn kernels from their brown sheathing, tossing unusable white kernels to a starving pig that survived the storm. Oranges found on the ground were squeezed over the meat. Young children pulled still younger ones away from the flames of a wood fire. A pot of beans was placed between two flat stones to cook for everyone. A rooster crowed as a dense fog rolled over the mountains. â€œOur country has collapsed,â€ muttered a boy, Wilkens Desrosiers, who had come looking for food. â€œWe cannot go to school and it will be years before we can rebuild our homes to what they once were. â€ More neighbors arrived, each helping in their own way, sifting the food into tidy piles or fetching water from a river at the base of the mountain. The cave remained on their minds. â€œUntil we can rebuild our homes to stand the rain, we will return when it storms,â€ he said. The dead were mourned in their absence. Mr. Desrosiers counted six by name, their passing registered only in the minds of survivors. Throughout the mountains, death was recorded in intimate rituals, held in the valleys and far reaches, obscured from the eyes of outsiders. Near midnight, miles from the village, the pained ballads carried in the dark, fixed to the rhythm of drums fashioned from buckets and tin plates. The music filled the hills, rising in a haunting chorus, the source visible by a sole candle lit in the bedroom of the departed. The words conveyed a simple hurt, a mÃ©lange of strength and loss. â€œWe are poor people, but we are strong,â€ they sang. â€œWe will not live on our knees. â€ The men sat in a small circle, the sons of a farmer who died in the storm. Led by their eldest brother, they would sing for eight days, having arrived only that morning from the capital to bury their father, Miradieu Alexis. They spent the day reconstructing what they could of the home, now a solitary cabin embedded in the shadowless countryside of night. As they danced and sang, the smell of crushed foliage and sour rum filled the air, a performance as anonymous as the death it venerated.", "output": "1. True"}

Geoffrey Kahn, a former House intelligence committee staffer, is the only person named so far to Trumpâ€™s intelligence community â€œlanding team,â€ they said.  As a result, said one senior career intelligence officer, briefing books prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Agency, the National Counterterrorism Center, and 13 other agencies and organizations are â€œwaiting for someone to read them.â€â€It seems like an odd time to put issues like cyber security and international terrorism on the back burner,â€ said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Previous administrations, the official said, were quicker to staff their intelligence teams, in part because they considered intelligence issues critical to setting foreign policy, defense and budget priorities. The intelligence community has some 200,000 employees and contractors and an annual budget of more than $70 billion. It collects and analyzes information on a vast array of subjects, from national security threats such as terrorism and climate change to global conflicts and the foreign, defense and trade policies of foreign governments.     Kahn has been in periodic contact with the CIA, said two of the officials, adding that they did not know if he had been in touch with the other intelligence agencies. In addition to reviewing potential candidates for top posts, Kahn is responsible for coordinating briefings for nominees and helping prepare them for Senate confirmation hearings. Trump has announced that he intends to nominate U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas to succeed CIA Director John Brennan, who will step down in January.  He has yet to tap nominees for other senior positions, including a successor to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the top U.S. intelligence officer. Clapper, 75, will leave the government when Trump is sworn as president on January 20.  Trump on Tuesday received only his third intelligence briefing since he won the Nov. 8 presidential election, despite an offer from President Barack Obama of daily briefings, three of the officials said. Vice President-elect Mike Pence has been receiving intelligence briefings daily or nearly every day, one of the officials said. Trumpâ€™s decision to forgo daily briefings and his delay in designating more transition advisers to engage with the intelligence agencies may reflect his focus on filling the top economic positions in his administration. However, said the senior career official, it also may reflect the disinterest and distrust in U.S. intelligence Trump has expressed during and after his presidential campaign. Asked on Aug. 17 if he trusted U.S. intelligence, Trump replied: â€œNot so much from the people that have been doing it for our country. I mean, look whatâ€™s happened over the last 10 years.â€ After his first classified briefing as the Republican presidential candidate, Trump said he â€œdidnâ€™t learn anythingâ€ that prompted him to rethink his view about how to fight Islamic State. On the other hand, he said, â€œWhen they call it intelligence, itâ€™s there for a reason.â€On other occasions, he has contradicted or ignored what his briefers told him. After being briefed that U.S. intelligence had concluded that the Russian government was behind the hacking of U.S. political institutions, he said that â€œmaybe there is no hackingâ€ or than maybe it was China or â€œsomebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.â€Trumpâ€™s attitude contrasts with those of his predecessors. In his book â€œGetting to Know the President,â€ veteran CIA officer John Helgerson wrote that former President Jimmy Carter asked for longer briefings and Bill Clinton asked the CIA to expand his daily briefs to include economic and environmental issues.", "output": "1.

He was 85. The cause was cancer, a nephew, Richard Kylberg, said. An unusual figure in the world of elite mountaineering, Mr. Clinch was a tall, somewhat gangly man whose slight build was not in the hardy athletic mold of a   climber. He was, in addition, asthmatic. But he found his niche in the field by applying his intelligence, technical skill, practical knowledge and perseverance. In October 1955, Mr. Clinch, then in his   was relaxing after a spaghetti dinner with some fellow climbers in a Northern California living room when he issued an almost casual challenge. â€œWho wants to climb Hidden Peak in 1958?â€ he asked. The reference was to the   mountain on earth, located in the Karakoram range in northeast Pakistan. Known also as Gasherbrum I, at about 26, 500 feet it is one of the 14 mountains higher than 8, 000 meters and was, at the time, the   unclimbed peak in the world. (Dhaulagiri, in Nepal, at nearly 26, 800 feet, was not climbed until 1960.) His companions laughed  â€”   justifiably, Mr. Clinch would later write  â€”   but he assembled a small team of climbers (including two men who were there for the first inquiry) secured permission for the trek from the Pakistani government, shipped 7, 000 pounds of food and equipment halfway around the world, and met his original deadline. In the spring of 1958, Mr. Clinch led a support army of more than 100 people from the town of Skardu to Hidden Peak, 150 miles away, and in early July two members of the climbing party, Pete Schoening and Andy Kauffman, achieved the summit. An assault on the peak from a final temporary camp by a second group of climbers, including Mr. Clinch, was canceled because of threatening weather. That others got the glory for the first ascent was no bother to Mr. Clinch, a lawyer by profession who scaled mountains on several continents and was known among mountaineers as a consummate team player and a leader and organizer of infinite patience, diligence and humor. â€œHe would say to me, â€˜The mountains donâ€™t care who you are,â€™ â€ Mr. Kylberg, his nephew, said, meaning that great athletes could founder in the wild at high altitudes as easily as anyone else. â€œHe saw the mountains as a great human equalizer. â€ Mr. Clinchâ€™s physical achievements in enduring what he described, in The Saturday Evening Post in 1961, as â€œthe special agonies of   climbing, when the combination of blazing sun and snow makes it feel as if your head were in an oven and your feet in a freezer while you carry heavy loads,â€ were nonetheless impressive. In 1960, he had organized another first ascent in the Karakoram, leading a team of American and Pakistani mountaineers to the top of Masherbrum  â€”   sometimes known as Doomsday Mountain  â€”   at upward of 25, 600 feet. â€œNick had the capacity to fantasize and to translate fantasy into reality,â€ Tom Hornbein, who was part of the Masherbrum team, said in a telephone interview. Asked how a less than robust physical specimen could conquer such mammoth peaks, Mr. Hornbein (who in 1963, with another climber, forged a new route up Mount Everest) said that Mr. Clinch was a highly proficient climber technically, and that his ability to apply his climbing experience to the problems in front of him was peerless. â€œNick,â€ he added, â€œwas not lacking in drive. â€ Nicholas Bayard Clinch III was born in Evanston, Ill. on Nov. 9, 1930, and grew up in Dallas and in Roswell, N. M. where he attended the New Mexico Military Institute. His father was a military flyer who became a colonel in the Air Force. Nicholas III graduated from Stanford and went on to earn a law degree there. Like his father, he served in the Air Force. In the 1970s, he was a lawyer for the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, the financial institution in Irvine, Calif. that went bankrupt in 1989 during a scandal that sent Charles H. Keating Jr. the chief executive of its parent corporation, to prison for fraud. Mr. Clinch was a longtime member of the American Alpine Club and its president from 1968 to 1970. He was the executive director of the Sierra Club Foundation from 1975 to 1981, and he worked as an environmental consultant for the Fluor Corporation, a   engineering and construction firm. His attraction to the mountains began when he was a teenager. He spent summers at an adventure camp in Estes Park, Colo. and met many friends, including Mr. Hornbein, who would become climbing colleagues. Mr. Clinch married Elizabeth Wallace Campbell, known as Betsy, in 1964. Together they wrote â€œThrough a Land of Extremes: The Littledales of Central Asiaâ€ (2011) about the British explorers and adventurers St. George Littledale and his wife, Teresa. Mr. Clinch was also the author of â€œA Walk in the Skyâ€ (1982) an account of the Hidden Peak expedition. Mr. Clinch is survived by his wife a sister, Lee Everding and two daughters, Alison Clinch and Lee Bridges. One more of Mr. Clinchâ€™s remarkable climbing ventures, perhaps the most remarkable: In December 1966, with the sponsorship of the American Alpine Club and the National Geographic Society, he led a team of American climbers in the first ascent of Mount Vinson, at just over 16, 000 feet the highest peak in Antarctica. In temperatures well below zero (and in   sunlight) all 10 climbers in the group reached the summit. In 2006, according to the United States Geological Survey, a nearly   mountaintop, 1. 4 miles southeast of Mount Vinson, was named in his honor: Clinch Peak.", "output": "1. True"}

The measure would stop commercial flights until after a study of security measures and equipment at airports in Cuba.

{"instruction": "Task: Please determine whether the text is 0. False, 1. TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Multiple experts are calling into question the validity of the World Health Organizationâ€™s proposed revisions classifying gaming behaviors as a mental disorder. [The International Classification of Diseases, published by the World Health Organization, would define â€œGaming Disorderâ€ as a â€œpersistent or recurrent gaming behaviour (i. e. â€˜digital gamingâ€™ or â€˜ â€™) characterised by an impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities and continuation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences. â€ In other words, a lack of   regarding video games is being legitimized as a specific mental illness.  This isnâ€™t anything new. According to comment provided to Breitbart Tech by Dr. Christopher J. Ferguson of the Department of Psychology at Stetson University, â€œscholars have been investigating the concept of â€˜video game addictionâ€™ for probably over 2 decades now. â€ Despite all efforts, Dr. Ferguson points out that we still lack â€œany real clarityâ€ about â€œhow to define the concept, assess it, or whether it even is a â€˜realâ€™ thing in the sense of it being unique to video games. â€ But that hasnâ€™t stopped anyone from trying. According to Dr. Ferguson: Despite [the lack of clarity] weâ€™ve seen some pushes to institutionalize video game addiction as â€œinternet gaming disorderâ€ in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (published by the American Psychiatric Association) and, now as â€œgaming disorderâ€ in the International [Classification] of Diseases (published by the World Health Organization.) The concerns among some scholars are manifest.  Itâ€™s not clear why video games are being singled out as compared to many other behaviors that can become addictive (sex, food, work, exercise, etc.) Thatâ€™s why Ferguson and a number of his colleagues have published an open letter to the WHO regarding this classification: Concerns about problematic gaming behaviors deserve our full attention. However, we claim that it is far from clear that these problems can or should be attributed to a new disorder. The empirical basis for a Gaming Disorder proposal, such as in the new   suffers from fundamental issues. Our main concerns are the low quality of the research base, the fact that the current operationalization leans too heavily on substance use and gambling criteria, and the lack of consensus on symptomatology and assessment of problematic gaming. And this isnâ€™t a simple matter of semantics. The ramifications of haphazardly diagnosing people with a mental illness are enormous: The act of formalizing this disorder, even as a proposal, has negative medical, scientific,   societal, and human rights fallout that should be considered. Of particular concern are moral panics around the harm of video gaming. They might result in premature application of diagnosis in the medical community and the treatment of abundant   cases, especially for children and adolescents. Second, research will be locked into a confirmatory approach, rather than an exploration of the boundaries of normal versus pathological. Third, the healthy majority of gamers will be affected negatively. In addition to public panic, premature diagnoses, and the tendency to approach further study with the assumption that the disorder is real  â€”   the bias of the aforementioned â€œconfirmatory approachâ€  â€”   there are even more serious issues at hand. First, that â€œthe premature inclusion of Gaming Disorder as a diagnosis in   will cause significant stigma to the millions of children who play video games as a part of a normal, healthy life. â€ The most serious implications of this study, Dr. Ferguson points out, are that the classification could very easily â€œend up as an excuse to put some kids in harsh â€˜treatmentâ€™ camps or perhaps be used as an excuse for media â€ especially in â€œ  countries. â€ That conclusion might be seen as mere conjecture if not for correspondence between Dr. Ferguson and Drs. Geoffrey Reed and Vladimir Poznyak, both involved in the drafting of   specifically noting â€œenormous pressure, especially from Asian countriesâ€ and â€œstrong request from [WHO] stakeholdersâ€ to include this definition of Gaming Disorder.  Drs. Reed and Poznyak did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Breitbart Tech. The classification could have negative effects across the world, especially where labels of mental illness could rob someone of their rights. Imagine if having Angry Birds installed on your smartphone was enough of an excuse to mandate attendance at a â€œtreatment camp,â€ and youâ€™re starting to get an idea of how this could go very wrong, very quickly. But even aside from all of that, Dr. Ferguson argues the science just doesnâ€™t back up the WHOâ€™s conclusion: Many of the â€œsymptomsâ€ proposed (particularly for the DSM version) are kind of normal stuff that many studies suggest arenâ€™t really good predictors of problems. Thereâ€™s also data suggesting the whole concept of â€œvideo game addictionâ€ isnâ€™t really stable and tends to go away by itself over time without treatment. The concern lies in the history of using classifications of mental illness as a weapon against groups and individuals by countriesâ€™ governments. Over 6, 000 people in China  â€”   most of them teenagers  â€”   have been treated with actual electroshock therapy just because they were thought to have used the Internet too much. China also has a long history of committing whistleblowers and other dissidents to psychiatric â€œcareâ€ for the crime of disagreement. The subject is extensively covered in the 2002 book Dangerous Minds: Political Psychiatry in China Today and Its Origins in the Mao Era, published by Human Rights Watch. Richard J. Bonnieâ€™s paper â€œPolitical Abuse of Psychiatry in the Soviet Union and in China: Complexities and Controversies,â€ published in The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law in 2002, also paints a picture of just how convenient it can be for the powerful to leverage psychological diagnoses in order to silence those who disagree. He explains that such practices are â€œuniformly understood to be a particularly pernicious form of repression,â€ citing examples in which â€œpsychatric diagnosis was essentially an exercise of social power. â€ By way of example, Bonnie explains: Under applicable laws of Russia and the other former Soviet Republics, a person charged with a crime could be subjected to â€œcustodial measures of a medical natureâ€ if the criminal act was proved and the person was found â€œnonimputableâ€ due to mental illness. 7 Nonimputable offenders could be placed in maximum security hospitals (the notorious â€œspecial hospitalsâ€) or in ordinary hospitals, depending on their social dangerousness. All the persons interviewed by the delegation had been found nonimputable and socially dangerous and confined in special hospitals after criminal proceedings that deviated substantially from the general requirements specified in Soviet law. Typically, the patients reported that they had been arrested, taken to jail, taken to a hospital for forensic examination, and then taken to another hospital under a compulsory treatment order, without ever seeing an attorney or appearing incourt. The delegation found that there was no clinical basis for the judicial finding of nonimputability in 17 of these cases. In fact, the delegation found no evidence of mental disorder of any kind in 14 cases. It is likely that these individuals are representative of many hundreds of others who were found nonimputable for crimes of political or religious dissent inthe Soviet Union, mainly between 1970 and 1990. And with regard to China: Munroâ€™s research indicates, convincingly in my view, that the Soviet system of forensic psychiatry was transplanted to China during the 1950s and 1960s, thereby placing a small subset of psychiatrists at the intersection of criminal prosecution and psychiatric confinement, and importing a smoothly oiled process by which psychiatrists found that most offenders referred for assessment lacked criminal responsibility and committed them for treatment without any adjudication or judicial oversight. Eventually, in the 1980s, China also established a system of   forensic hospitals (Ankang) modeled after the Soviet â€œspecial hospitals,â€ for confining offenders who present a â€œsocial danger. â€ But lest you think that more open societies are immune to this insidious form of manipulation, consider our own messy history of psychiatric abuse. In 2010, a police officer was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward for attempting to reveal what he said was the truth about falsified crime rate statistics. He was eventually paid $600, 000 in a settlement by the City of New York after filing a $50 million human rights violation suit. Our foster care system stuffs victimized children full of psychotropic drugs in a thinly veiled attempted to make them easier to handle. Schizophrenia was allegedly used to deliberately hamper the rise of civil rights. Barry Goldwater was publicly crucified for his conservative views by a team of psychiatrists who disagreed with him politically the Goldwater Rule still exists because attacking someoneâ€™s mental fitness is such a potent weapon.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: A senior White House aide said on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for a short-term bill to shore up insurance markets.  Marc Short, the White Houseâ€™s top liaison to Congress, said on CNN that Obamacareâ€™s mandates and taxes would have to be rolled back and consumers be allowed to more heavily invest in health-savings accounts for Trump to sign off on any congressional deal.  â€œWeâ€™re willing to work on this but we need to make sure that weâ€™re getting something that will actually reduce healthcare costs,â€ Short said.  Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray unveiled legislation to shore up the insurance markets created under the 2010 healthcare law by reviving the subsidies, which Trump has discontinued, for two years to help lower-income Americans obtain medical coverage. The bill appeared to be gaining some momentum on Thursday after several Republican senators said they would support the measure. But Shortâ€™s comments may put a damper on hopes for any sort of bipartisan agreement. Democrats have consistently opposed efforts to dismantle any and all parts of Obamacare.  Short said the administration was sending a list of the principles it would like to see in any legislation to the billâ€™s co-authors and would likely make them public. â€œThe gist is we believe that the individual mandate should (be) repealed, employer mandate repealed and allow Americans to contribute to health savings accounts,â€ he said.  Earlier on Thursday, Alexander and Murray said the deal they struck now has the support of 12 of the 52 Republicans in the 100-seat Senate, as well as 12 Democrats.  While Alexander predicted in remarks on the Senate floor that the plan â€œwill become law in some fashion before the end of the year,â€ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not committed to bringing it to a vote, and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan is against it. Lobbyists and congressional aides closely following the matter said the legislation could make it onto the Senate floor tucked inside a bigger â€œmust-passâ€ bill that Congress needs to act on in December, such as a broad spending measure to prevent a federal government shutdown. Trump campaigned for the presidency last year promising to get rid of Obamacare, the signature legislative achievement of his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. But his fellow Republicans who control Congress have failed to repeal and replace the law thanks to deep intra-party divisions.  Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act, extended health insurance to 20 million people but Republicans call it  government interference in Americansâ€™ healthcare.     The lawâ€™s individual mandate requires all Americans to purchase health insurance, while its employer mandate requires businesses of a certain size to offer affordable coverage.  Trump initially indicated support for the Alexander-Murray agreement but reversed himself, saying on Wednesday â€œI can never support bailing outâ€ insurers. Senator Mike Rounds, one of the billâ€™s Republican co-sponsors, said that if Trump decides he does not support it, â€œthen it will not go forward.â€ When a reporter noted that Trump does oppose it, Rounds replied, â€œThat was yesterday.â€ Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas, who focuses on healthcare, said there was too much political uncertainty for investors to latch onto any one thing, with Trump â€œflip-flopping every dayâ€ and Ryan not supportive of the bill. Among hospital stocks, Community Health Systems (CYH.N) closed up 3.7 percent, Tenet Healthcare Corp (THC.N) rose 2.9 percent and HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA.N) gained 3 percent. Most insurers rose more modestly. Without the subsidies, insurance premiums for some of the 10  million Americans who get coverage through Obamacare markets will surge. Noting that some conservative Republicans object to the subsidies, Alexander asked, â€œWhatâ€™s conservative about creating chaos so millions canâ€™t buy insurance, or at least failing to deal with the chaos that has been created?â€ The bill has broad support among Democrats, but had just seven Republicans on record supporting it only a day earlier. Republican Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham, who co-authored a bill in September to repeal and replace Obamacare that failed to muster enough support, endorsed the bipartisan effort. â€œWe believe we need a package which stabilizes the market in the short term and lays the groundwork for a long-term solutionâ€ that would overhaul Obamacare, they said in a joint statement. If passed in December, as opposed to before the Nov. 1 beginning of enrollment for 2018 Obamacare insurance policies, it would be unlikely to affect premiums for next year, meaning its benefits might not be felt until 2019. Insurers have already decided whether to participate in the Obamacare markets and set higher rates to build in the possibility that the subsidies would vanish. Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people. The bill would also give more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: UNITED NATIONS  â€”   The American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, issued a stark warning on Friday to allies and rivals abroad, saying in her first remarks at the headquarters of the world body that the Trump administration would hold to account those who do not back the United States. â€œYouâ€™re going to see a change in the way we do business,â€ Ms. Haley said. â€œOur goal with the administration is to show value at the U. N. and the way weâ€™ll show value is to show our strength, show our voice, have the backs of our allies and make sure our allies have our back as well. â€ â€œFor those who donâ€™t have our back,â€ she added, â€œweâ€™re taking names we will make points to respond to that accordingly. â€ Ms. Haley offered no further details in brief remarks to reporters, nor did she take questions, before presenting her diplomatic credentials to the secretary general, AntÃ³nio Guterres. A former socialist politician from Portugal who took over the United Nations at the start of the year, Mr. Guterres is under pressure to persuade the Trump administration to not gouge the organization and to uphold Americaâ€™s international obligations, including on climate change. President Trump has dismissed the United Nations as a social club and suggested the United States could cut its funding of the organizationâ€™s efforts. His â€œAmerica firstâ€ pledges have raised concerns among diplomats at the United Nations about his commitment to international cooperation. The administrationâ€™s antipathy toward the United Nations has been sharpened since a Security Council resolution last month condemning Israeli settlements. Mr. Trump and Ms. Haley have criticized the Obama administrationâ€™s decision not to veto the resolution. And several Republican senators have supported legislation threatening to defund the United Nations unless the Security Council reverses the terms of the resolution, which Council diplomats say would be politically unworkable. The United States is the United Nationsâ€™ largest single donor, providing 22 percent of its regular budget, according to the terms of an international agreement that sets a countryâ€™s contribution based on its wealth. That assessed contribution pays for operating expenses like the electricity bills at its headquarters and human rights investigations in places like Syria and South Sudan. The United States also contributes voluntarily to other United Nations programs, including those that provide food and blankets to refugees fleeing war zones and that immunize children against preventable diseases. A draft executive order obtained by The New York Times proposes at least a 40 percent cut to those voluntary funds. Some of the provisions in the draft text are redundant, and it is unclear how serious these proposals are, or if they will ever be signed. Current and former officials said Friday that the Trump administration was delaying its plan to issue the order. The money that the United States voluntarily contributes to the United Nations is a little over 0. 1 percent of the total federal budget. Some Republican lawmakers have sought in the past to make some of the assessed dues also voluntary, but that idea has never passed muster with Congress. One area that is likely to draw scrutiny from the Trump administration, judging from what Ms. Haley said during her confirmation hearing, is peacekeeping. The United States pays the largest share of the peacekeeping budget  â€”   about 28 percent  â€”   but provides virtually no soldiers The threats to cut funding come as China has stepped up its role at the United Nations, increasing its support for peacekeeping and development aid. China also has a veto in the Security Council. â€œThis is a time of strength, this is a time of action, this is a time of getting things done,â€ Ms. Haley said on Friday, adding that she was prepared to   the United Nationsâ€™ efforts. â€œEverything thatâ€™s working weâ€™re going to make it better. Everything thatâ€™s not working weâ€™re going to try and fix. And anything that seems to be obsolete and not necessary weâ€™re going to do away with,â€ she said. Her tone was in contrast to a far more conciliatory approach just days ago, when she faced a Senate confirmation hearing. There, she said she did not favor a â€œslash and burnâ€ approach to American contributions to the United Nations, but she questioned its value to American national interests. â€œAre we getting what we pay for?â€ she asked. Ms. Haley, 45, a former Republican governor of South Carolina and one of Mr. Trumpâ€™s most outspoken critics during the campaign, had tried to distance herself from some of what Mr. Trump has said about international diplomacy. She has said she favors continuing sanctions against Russia, for instance, but also cooperation with the Kremlin on counterterrorism. She has said she is concerned about security threats posed by refugees, and while she said climate change was â€œon the table,â€ she said she did not favor policies that imperiled business.", "output": "1.

But having been interred in three different places since his death in 1849, James K. Polk, the 11th president of the United States, now faces the prospect of having his sleep disturbed yet again. A new proposal making its way through the Tennessee legislature calls for digging up the bodies of Polk and his wife, Sarah Childress Polk, both of which have been buried on the grounds of the state Capitol for more than a century. They would then be relocated to a final resting place at a Polk family home and museum in the small city of Columbia. Supporters say the move will properly honor an unjustly overlooked president, a man who expanded the territory of the United States by a third, signed a law establishing the Smithsonian Institution and created the Naval Academy. Opponents, including Teresa Elam, 65, a distant relative of Polkâ€™s, are calling it nothing short of macabre, and an unsavory effort to promote tourism in Columbia, a city of 37, 000 about 50 miles south of Nashville that is otherwise known for a colorful yearly celebration of its   industry. â€œTheyâ€™re desecrating a grave,â€ said Ms. Elam, who has walked the halls of the Capitol with a sheaf of historical documents, making her case to lawmakers. â€œItâ€™s been on the Capitol grounds for about 124 years. Itâ€™s dishonor and disrespect. â€ The relocation of a presidentâ€™s body after death is not  . In 1858, the remains of James Monroe, the fifth president, were moved from New York to his native Virginia, at a time of rising sectional tension. And the coffin of President Abraham Lincoln has been moved around his burial spot in Springfield, Ill. at least 17 times, by one count, including a bizarre thwarted effort in 1876 to steal his body and hold it for ransom. Here, the prospect that the presidential remains could be moved yet again has prompted rare fits of passion on the topic of Polk, a man historians have called â€œpriggishâ€ and â€œcolorless,â€ and one whose legacy is often overshadowed by his    mentor, Andrew Jackson, who is buried at the Hermitage, his family plantation, a major tourist draw here. Indeed, when President Trump, who often likens himself to Jackson, visited Nashville this month, he laid a wreath on Jacksonâ€™s tomb, honoring him in a speech as a president who â€œunderstood that real leadership means putting America first. â€ If Mr. Trump knew where Polkâ€™s tomb was, he did not let on. On Monday, the State Senate is expected to vote on a resolution that would be the first step in an approval process for relocating the bodies. Disinterring the remains will also require the approval of the stateâ€™s House of Representatives, the governor, the Tennessee Historical Commission and a local judge. The Polksâ€™ grave, which is currently tucked away on a grassy patch, was designed by William Strickland, the noted Greek Revival architect who designed the state Capitol and George Washingtonâ€™s sarcophagus at Mount Vernon in Virginia. A handsome monument framed by classical columns notes that Polk â€œplanted the laws of the American union on the shores of the Pacific. â€ The grave is dwarfed by a nearby equestrian statue of Jackson. State Senator Joey Hensley, a Republican representing Columbia and the sponsor of the bill, said the grave seems overlooked in its current spot. â€œI honestly served up here 14 years and had never seen the site,â€ he said on Thursday. â€œItâ€™s not handicap accessible. Itâ€™s not really talked about much when they do the Capitol tour. Not many people visit it. Itâ€™s just not a very good place to honor his legacy. â€ Much drama preceded the graveâ€™s ultimate location. Polk had numerous ailments. An operation for urinary stones as a teenager is likely to have left him sterile or impotent, and may explain why he did not have children, according to John Seigenthaler, one of his biographers. Polk left the White House in 1849 after serving just one term, as he had promised, and returned that April to Nashville, where he had previously served a   term as governor. But the city was in the midst of a cholera outbreak, and Polk contracted the disease and died in June at age 53. Tom Price, the curator of the President James K. Polk Home and Museum in Columbia, said that by city ordinance, cholera victims at the time had to be buried at the municipal cemetery on the edge of town. By May 1850, however, Polk was moved to Polk Place, a grand home a few blocks from the Capitol that he had bought in 1847. His wife, a formidable woman who did much to shape his career, remained in Polk Place, celebrated as one of the nationâ€™s most famous widows, until her death in 1891. Then things got complicated. In a will he drew up five months before his death, Polk, a lawyer, stipulated that both his body and that of his wife should be buried on the premises of Polk Place. He also stipulated that after his death and his wifeâ€™s, the property should be held in trust by the state, which must always allow a blood relative to live there. Upon the death of Polkâ€™s wife, a number of heirs filed a lawsuit arguing that the will was invalid. According to Bill Carey, a local researcher and writer, the court ruled in their favor, on the grounds that the will violated the   rule against perpetuities, which limits an ownerâ€™s ability to leave property to unborn future generations. Polk Place was sold and torn down today, there is a boutique hotel on the property. On Sept. 19, 1893, Polkâ€™s body was moved to the Capitol, where he was buried alongside his wife. â€œIn my mind,â€ Mr. Carey wrote in 2015, â€œthe reinterment of President and Mrs. Polk is one of the most disrespectful deeds ever committed by the state of Tennessee. â€ Critics of the new plan include Carroll Van West, the state historian. â€œWhen Polk left the White House he came home to Nashville, and his wife stayed there for decades afterward,â€ Mr. Van West told The Nashville Scene last week. On Wednesday, Mr. Price, the curator of Polk House, gave a tour of the   historical property. It was late afternoon and there were no other visitors. The handsome   home was built by Polkâ€™s father in 1816. Polk lived in it as a young man from 1818 to 1824. Today it is furnished with much of the furniture from Polk Place. A gift shop sells jars of Polk Pickles and bottles of Presidentâ€™s Choice wine. Mr. Price acknowledged that it was difficult to get students, even from schools around Columbia, to tour the home because Jacksonâ€™s famous Hermitage is so close by. But he insisted that the proposal to move Polkâ€™s body was not about tourism, as much as it was about honoring a presidentâ€™s wishes. â€œHe wanted to be buried at home,â€ he said, and this was as close as Polk could get.", "output": "1.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: WASHINGTON  â€”   Investors in financial markets, and those predicting faster economic growth in 2017, would do well to remember the famous words that William McChesney Martin Jr. the former Federal Reserve chairman, uttered way back in 1955: The Fedâ€™s job is to remove the punch bowl just as the party gets going.   Donald J. Trumpâ€™s promises to cut taxes and regulation and to increase spending on infrastructure and defense have convinced many that a sugar high in the near term will goose the economy. But Fed officials say the economy is already expanding at something close to its maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth would drive inflation toward unwelcome levels. To avoid overheating, the Fed could respond by raising interest rates more quickly. The more Mr. Trump stimulates growth, the faster the Fed is likely to increase rates. â€œI guess I would argue that I think people have gotten a bit ahead of themselves about what a Trump presidency would mean,â€ said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura. â€œIf we have a big stimulus, the logical thing for the Fed to do is to raise rates faster. There isnâ€™t a whole heck of a lot of scope to just let the economy run under those circumstances. Thereâ€™s a big question about whether fiscal stimulus under Trump just leads to higher interest rates. â€ Underscoring that question, the Fed is expected to raise its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the first time since last December in light of new economic data. The rate sits in a range of 0. 25 percent to 0. 5 percent, a low level intended to stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and  . Analysts predict the Fed will shift the range upward by a quarter of a percentage point, modestly reducing those incentives. The rate increase is widely regarded as a foregone conclusion. The odds, derived from asset prices, topped 95 percent Monday, according to the CME Group. The looming question is how quickly the Fed will continue to raise rates in 2017. Economic forecasts always require large assumptions, but that is particularly true in the present case because Mr. Trump has provided relatively few details about his plans. Perhaps the most accurate thing that can be said about Mr. Trumpâ€™s victory is that it has increased the uncertainty of the economic outlook. â€œAt this juncture, it is premature to reach firm conclusions about what will likely occur,â€ William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said in a recent speech. During his campaign, Mr. Trump predicted 4 percent annual growth, and his actions since Election Day point to a   goal of   job creation. â€œOur No. 1 priority is going to be the economy, get back to 3 to 4 percent growth,â€ Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Trumpâ€™s pick to serve as Treasury secretary, said last month. Many economists regard such growth predictions as fanciful the economy has been mired in an extended period of slow growth and the reasons, including an aging population and a dearth of innovation, are unlikely to change quickly. Some think Mr. Trump is more likely to push the economy into recession than to catalyze a new boom. Even if Mr. Trump is right, however, the Fed does not want 4 percent growth. The central bankâ€™s outlook has become increasingly gloomy. Officials estimated in September that annual growth of 1. 8 percent was the maximum sustainable pace, and they predicted growth would not exceed 2 percent in the next three years. They will update those forecasts Wednesday, but large shifts are unlikely. Fed officials also are increasingly convinced that steady job growth has substantially eliminated the   backlog of people seeking work. The unemployment rate fell to 4. 6 percent in November, a level the Fed regards as healthy. For years, Fed officials urged Congress to increase fiscal spending. Now, Mr. Trump is promising to do just that  â€”   and the Fed has concluded that it is too late. Stanley Fischer, the Fedâ€™s vice chairman, said last month the Fed might still benefit from fiscal stimulus because it could raise rates more quickly. That would increase the Fedâ€™s ability to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates. But such gains would come at real cost: A fiscal stimulus would increase the federal governmentâ€™s debt burden, which already is at a high level by historical standards, reducing the room for a fiscal response to a future downturn. Janet L. Yellen, the Fedâ€™s chairwoman, urged Congress last month to be mindful that the government is already on the hook for more spending as baby boomers age into retirement. â€œWith the   . D. P. ratio at around 77 percent, thereâ€™s not a lot of fiscal space, should a shock to the economy occur, an adverse shock, that did require fiscal stimulus,â€ she said. The tension between fiscal and monetary policy is likely to unfold in slow motion. Mr. Trump has promised to press for rapid changes in government policy, but Congress is not built for speed. A similar effort to cut taxes at the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, for example, was signed into law on June 7, 2001. The impact of new cuts, and any increase in infrastructure spending that Mr. Trump can persuade dubious Republicans to embrace, would be felt mostly in future years. Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moodyâ€™s Analytics, predicted that tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and   spending would fuel faster growth in the first half of Mr. Trumpâ€™s   term. But he said that the Fedâ€™s rate increases, and restrictions on trade and immigration, would gradually begin to take a larger toll. By the end, Mr. Zandi predicted, the American economy would be â€œunnervingly closeâ€ to recession. â€œThe Fed and markets in general will ultimately wash out any benefit,â€ Mr. Zandi said Monday. â€œThe economy under President Trump ultimately will be diminished. â€ Other economists are more optimistic, predicting that the stimulus will not be fully offset by Fed policy. Mr. Dudley appeared to endorse this view in his recent speech, suggesting that the rise in financial markets was â€œbroadly appropriate. â€ Some of Mr. Trumpâ€™s proposals also could increase the economyâ€™s potential growth rate, for example by improving infrastructure or encouraging corporate investment. On the other hand, the Fedâ€™s march toward higher rates may be amplified by the bond market. Rates are already rising, and investors concerned about inflation and larger federal deficits are likely to generate persistent upward pressure. Those effects are already visible. Stock prices have climbed since Mr. Trumpâ€™s surprising victory, increasing the wealth of shareholders. But borrowing costs also climbed. The average rate on a   mortgage loan was 4. 13 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, up from 3. 54 percent just before the election.", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: SAN FRANCISCO  â€”   The virtual currency Bitcoin has been swept up in yet another speculative frenzy, pushing its price toward the peak it last reached in late 2013. The price of Bitcoin has been buoyed by increased interest from places like Venezuela, where the local currency has lost much of its value, and India, where the government recently removed the largest cash notes from circulation. More broadly, a tilt toward isolationism that has emerged in American and European politics  â€”   highlighted by Donald J. Trumpâ€™s election victory  â€”   has given a new sheen to a currency that can move between countries with little oversight. â€œThe more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders,â€ said Gil Luria, the director of research at Wedbush Securities. Still, most of the people actually buying and selling Bitcoin these days are coming from a single country: China. Some wealthy Chinese have used Bitcoin to evade their governmentâ€™s strict controls on moving money in and out of the country, according to Bitcoin specialists in China. But the heavy trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, much of it by automated software, suggests that most of the price movement is a result of bets by speculators. In recent days, the price of a Bitcoin has been about 3 percent higher on these exchanges than on dollar denominated exchanges, suggesting more demand in China than outside. The importance of speculators suggests that the value of Bitcoin is still driven by the hope of how it might be used someday, rather than real world use today, which has generally been hard to quantify. In dollar terms, a Bitcoin was going for about $1, 025 on Tuesday, or about 140 percent more than what it cost at the beginning of 2016. The volatile price has led many analysts to conclude that is less similar to a currency than to a commodity, like gold, which has a value resulting from its scarcity. In Bitcoinâ€™s case, the rules of the network dictate that only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be created. The recent rise has brought the price of one Bitcoin to within striking distance of the price of an ounce of gold, which was about $1, 150 on Monday. The price has increased in the last year despite the lack of interest in Bitcoin from banks and a majority of more sophisticated investors. After showing early interest in the currency, most big banks have moved on to make investments in the blockchain, the new type of ledger technology introduced by Bitcoin, while eschewing Bitcoin itself. Some central banks have talked about issuing their own national currencies on some sort of blockchain inspired by but unrelated to the blockchain that Bitcoin uses. Bitcoin and the blockchain were introduced in late 2008 by a mysterious coder who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Anyone with a computer and internet access can open a Bitcoin wallet and help maintain the blockchain ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Because it is run by a decentralized network of computers around the world, Bitcoin does not require a central authority like a central bank or financial institution. That has made it attractive to people who hope to do financial transactions anonymously, such as the drug dealers who have sold illicit goods for Bitcoin on the Silk Road website and its successors. New Bitcoins are released at regular intervals to computers helping to support the Bitcoin network, and previously released Bitcoins can be bought and sold on exchanges around the world. Since 2009, the price of Bitcoin has generally been defined by long periods of stability marked by short periods of speculative excitement. The only other time the price of Bitcoin has exceeded $1, 000 was in late 2013, when the demand was driven by a surge of interest from Chinese investors and traders. The price soon crashed when one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, which was based in Tokyo and went bankrupt, announced that it had lost most of the Bitcoins held by its customers (the cause remains in dispute). The Bitcoin price fell to its low  â€”   under $200  â€”   in early 2015. Since then, the price has risen in fits and starts, in part because of continuing hacking and fraud, and because of fights over the direction of the Bitcoin network. Many Bitcoin businesses have wanted to edit the basic Bitcoin software to change the number of transactions that can move through the network every day. But the proposed changes have run into opposition from the team of coders responsible for maintaining the basic Bitcoin software. Many Chinese Bitcoin companies have sided with the coders. That disagreement has led to slowdowns on the Bitcoin network, with some transactions taking days to be processed. The slowdowns have made it harder to use Bitcoin for everyday payments. But through the controversy the security of the basic Bitcoin wallets and transaction software has held up, making it a potential alternative for people in countries with less secure currencies and financial institutions. In November, interest in Bitcoin spiked in India after the government announced moves to quickly ban the largest Indian bank notes, in an effort to crack down on corruption. The continued fall in the value of the Venezuelan currency, the bolÃ­var, has led to reports about Venezuelans desperate to exchange their money for Bitcoin. But despite the new demand, the total value of all outstanding Bitcoin, about $16 billion, is still only that of a   American company, and is not large enough to sustain the demand of even a moderate number of Indians or Venezuelans looking to store their wealth in the virtual currency. That points back to the importance of speculators, who are betting that someday soon people worldwide will turn to Bitcoin for their daily financial needs, and push the price much higher. â€œI ascribe only 10 percent of the value of Bitcoin to current day usage, and more like 90 percent of it to the expectation of future usage,â€ Mr. Luria of Webush Securities said.", "output": "1.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: MOSCOW  â€”   The Russian police arrested hundreds of people in nationwide   protests on Sunday, including the opposition leader Aleksei Navalny in Moscow, where thousands gathered for the biggest demonstration in five years against President Vladimir V. Putin. The protest in the capital took the form of a synchronized walk along a major shopping street to avoid a ban on unsanctioned stationary gatherings. It was one of 99 similar rallies in cities and towns across the country  â€”   from Vladivostok in the far east to Kaliningrad in the west  â€”   according to the organizer, Mr. Navalnyâ€™s   foundation. All but 17 of these, the foundation said, had been declared illegal by the authorities. In Moscow, some protesters tried to block security vans with cars, and the authorities deployed the riot police and surveillance helicopters. But they mostly avoided the brutal measures used in neighboring Belarus on Saturday against protesters in the capital, Minsk, and other cities. The police in Belarus beat and arrested hundreds of people who tried to gather for the latest in demonstrations against President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994. But while less   than in Belarus, whose   president is often referred to as â€œEuropeâ€™s last dictator,â€ the police crackdown in Moscow could still complicate efforts by President Trump to deliver on pledges to â€œget alongâ€ with Mr. Putin. In a statement on Sunday that reflected widespread wariness of the Russian leader in Washington, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said: â€œPutinâ€™s thugocracy is on full display. The United States government cannot be silent about Russiaâ€™s crackdown on peaceful protesters. Free speech is what weâ€™re all about and Americans expect our leaders to call out thugs who trample the basic human rights of speech, press, assembly and protest. â€ Shortly after the senatorâ€™s statement, Mark Toner, the acting spokesman for the State Department in Washington, said the United States â€œstrongly condemns the detention of hundreds of peaceful protesters throughout Russia on Sundayâ€ and called for their immediate release. â€œDetaining peaceful protesters, human rights observers, and journalists is an affront to core democratic values,â€ he added. The protests in Russia on Sunday  â€”   nominally against corruption but also a rare show of public defiance against Mr. Putin, who has found a fierce and enduring critic in Mr. Navalny  â€”   were the largest coordinated display of public dissatisfaction since   demonstrations in 2011 and 2012, after an election that was tainted by fraud. Protesters tried to prevent a police van from taking Mr. Navalny away and chanted: â€œThis is our city. This is our city. â€ Others shouted, â€œRussia without Putin,â€ and held up pieces of paper denouncing the Russian president and his allies as thieves. In a Twitter post, Mr. Navalny urged his followers to continue with the demonstration after he was grabbed by police officers as he tried to join the crowds along Tverskaya Street in the center of Moscow. â€œGuys, Iâ€™m O. K.,â€ he wrote in a message in Russian. â€œNo need to fight to get me out. Walk along Tverskaya. Our topic of the day is the fight against corruption. â€ The Moscow Police Department said on its website that â€œaround 500â€ people had been arrested in the city for taking part in an â€œunapproved public event. â€   a group that monitors arrests, said the number of arrests in Moscow was at least 1, 000. Instead of waving big banners with antigovernment slogans as in previous protests, most of those who joined Sundayâ€™s walk on Tverskaya Street displayed their feelings discreetly. Some waved Russian flags, cloaking their opposition in the same patriotism that Mr. Putin has used so successfully to boost his popularity. Others carried easily hidden signs featuring pictures of ducks, a reference to a claim by Mr. Navalny that corrupt officials even build houses for their ducks. Among those arrested in Moscow were Russian and foreign journalists, the leader of a small opposition party, Nikolai Lyaskin  â€”   who said he was hit around the head by police officers and taken to a hospital  â€”   and a British student, Gregory Hill, 17. Demoralized and divided since the   election protests, which fizzled amid a wave of arrests, Russiaâ€™s opposition has struggled to make its voice heard over a din of   sentiment on   television, which invariably presents opponents of Mr. Putin as traitors in cahoots with the West. But Mr. Navalny, a charismatic   campaigner who helped lead the   protests, has shown a knack for turning repressive action against him and his followers to his own advantage. When an assailant doused him in a green liquid in Siberia last week, he exulted that his face made him look like a superhero. Instead of directly attacking Mr. Putin, who is hugely popular outside more   cities like Moscow, Mr. Navalny has focused on rallying support by exposing corruption, an issue that alarms even many of Mr. Putinâ€™s supporters. Mr. Putin, who is widely expected to seek another term as president in elections next year, has ruled Russia as president or prime minister since the former president, Boris N. Yeltsin, resigned on Dec. 31, 1999. He faces no credible opposition other than that mobilized by Mr. Navalny, the founder and leader of the Foundation for Fighting Corruption. The opposition leader has declared his intention to run in the 2018 presidential race, despite a criminal conviction in February on fraud charges that made him ineligible to compete but was widely viewed as a political ploy to keep him out of the race. Even if Mr. Navalny manages to compete for the presidency, he has little chance of winning. But his presence on the ballot would end what since 2000 have been a series of tightly choreographed presidential contests that resembled coronations. Dmitri Charishnikov, a    web designer who answered Mr. Navalnyâ€™s call to walk up and down Tverskaya Street, said protests would change nothing as most Russians â€œbelieve what they see on televisionâ€ and strongly support Mr. Putin. But he added that he still wanted to show that â€œanother Russia still exists. â€ Nearby, a police officer shouted through a bullhorn that all those walking in the area were â€œparticipants in an unsanctioned gatheringâ€ and must immediately disperse or risk prosecution. State television, the main source of news for most Russians, responded to the protests by ignoring them. In a report published this month, Mr. Navalny detailed how Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, a close ally of Mr. Putinâ€™s, had built a lavish empire of mansions, country estates, luxury yachts, an Italian vineyard and an   palace near St. Petersburg. Mr. Navalny called for the protests after Russiaâ€™s Parliament, which is dominated by United Russia  â€”   a political party loyal to Mr. Putin  â€”   ignored demands for an investigation into accusations of corruption by senior government officials. By dusk on Sunday, the protests in Moscow had wound down after sporadic scuffles between the police and protesters. Russian news media reported at least one police officer was taken to a hospital in Moscow with head injuries. A spokesman for the interior ministry in St. Petersburg denied reports one of its officers had died after being beaten by protesters.", "output": "1. True"}

Ticket sales totaled $21. 5 million, a bit less than anticipated. This   remake charmed most critics, but its crowd appeal was limited.

Trump, few have given him more mileage than his fleet of aircraft. His Boeing 757 jet, often referred to as Trump Force One, has received the full    lifestyle treatment The Washington Post even queried whether it was better than Air Force One. One of Mr. Trumpâ€™s helicopters has gotten similar coverage an interior renovation made CNBCâ€™s â€œSecret Lives of the Super Richâ€ in a segment entitled â€œPimp My Chopper. â€ A close look at Mr. Trumpâ€™s two airplanes  â€”   the 757 and a smaller jet used on the campaign trail  â€”   and three helicopters, however, suggests that their value rests chiefly in their marketing potential, with the Trump stamp of status masking the fleetâ€™s age. Four of the five aircraft are more than 20 years old, a rarity for most billionaires. The exception is a    Cessna 750 Citation X  â€”   the only one of the five without the Trump name painted on it in large letters. The smaller plane was grounded last week after The New York Times reported that its registration had expired in January. It is now cleared to fly again, according to the F. A. A. Most people who own aircraft do not have more than one or two. Even those who can afford to own planes often lease or charter them instead, offering a layer of ease and anonymity. But anonymity is not Mr. Trumpâ€™s style. The Boeing, built in 1991 to seat roughly 200 people, is Mr. Trumpâ€™s favorite flying toy, he said in an interview on Saturday. The jet, which once did duty with a commercial airline in Mexico in the 1990s, has been famously renovated. It has a bedroom the fixtures are brushed with   gold and the toilet seats were reupholstered with Edelman leather, which also graces the Eames chairs in Ivanka Trumpâ€™s den. â€œItâ€™s like a new plane,â€ Mr. Trump said in a documentary that showed off some of the renovations. â€œThe plane is very much an extension of the Trump brand. â€ While the 757 might seem like an odd choice for a man who puts his net worth at $11 billion, and, records show, does not use the plane much to travel abroad, Mr. Trump has cited it and his other planes as proof of how he gets good value for his money. In the 1980s, for example, he paid $8 million to buy a 1968 Boeing 727 from a financially troubled Texas company, Diamond Shamrock, according to his book â€œThe Art of the Deal. â€ Mr. Trump said a smaller Gulfstream jet would have cost more than twice as much. â€œIt was a little more plane than I needed,â€ he wrote, â€œbut I find it hard to resist a good deal when the opportunity presents itself. â€ In the interview on Saturday, Mr. Trump said he did not own the five aircraft to burnish his brand, but agreed that the fleet had â€œpromotional value. â€ He added that he could get by without owning a Boeing 757 but it was a â€œgreat luxury to have. â€ Air travel is one of the largest expenses of Mr. Trumpâ€™s Republican presidential campaign: A company he owns has charged the campaign approximately $3. 7 million in travel costs since he announced his candidacy in June 2015. Using the 757 does not help keep costs down: It guzzles fuel and costs thousands of dollars an hour to fly, more than private planes being used to shuttle other presidential candidates. Still, Mr. Trump has used it to crisscross the country, sometimes with just a small group of people aboard. The Boeing also weighs more than 100, 000 pounds, making it too heavy to land at many smaller airports, including one at Teterboro, N. J. the airport of choice for wealthy New Yorkers like Mr. Trump. Instead it must fly in and out of La Guardia Airport in Queens, which Mr. Trump, and others,  have likened to what one might find in a third world country. La Guardia does offer a marketing perk: The 757 can often be seen at the airport, a billboard on wheels. Mr. Trump said that he was aware of the Boeingâ€™s limitations and that he did not â€œuse it that much. â€ According to F. A. A. records, the Boeing has flown about 333 hours between Mr. Trumpâ€™s announcement of his intention to run for president last June and March 16, 2016. During the same stretch, F. A. A. records show, the Cessna has flown roughly 216 hours. A review by The Times shows most of the hours logged were for campaign travel. Large jets are popular among professional sports teams and rock bands, which have to move large groups and equipment. Still, some individuals and companies do own such aircraft. Ronald W. Burkle, a billionaire investor who owns stakes in a number of companies, including Whole Foods Market, flies on a Boeing 757 registered to his firm. Las Vegas Sands, a casino operator run by the billionaire Sheldon Adelson, has several larger planes that are used to transport company executives and Sands customers. Buying older planes has advantages: In addition to being less expensive, their depreciation costs are lower. Mr. Trump said he liked older planes because they had been â€œtestedâ€ and had â€œbeen around. â€ For Mr. Trump, doing things bigger than most has been a guiding principle, as reflected in his penchant for slapping his name on buildings and planes. In June 1989 he launched the Trump Shuttle, after paying $365 million to buy the old Eastern Airlines shuttle operations, which connected New York City with Boston and Washington. The deal is not counted among his more successful ventures. In 1990 he defaulted on his loan and lost control of the airline to a group of lenders. Around the same time, a helicopter shuttle service he ran also fizzled. As for Mr. Trumpâ€™s personal travel, he prefers to fly private. In 2009, he decided to sell his Boeing 727, which was by then 41 years old. He replaced it with another used aircraft, the Boeing 757. A company controlled by the billionaire Paul Allen, a founder of Microsoft, had bought that plane in 1995. Mr. Allen did a full renovation, transforming it into a luxurious private jet. He installed a master suite that included a bathroom and guest room. He put a conference table, overhead projector and bar in the center of the aircraft. This room had two couches and 11 single seats, according to F. A. A. records. Elsewhere on the plane, Mr. Allen installed 12 sleeper seats, each with their own foldout monitors.  He agreed to sell it to Mr. Trump in 2010, records show. The purchase price was not disclosed, though it was widely reported that Mr. Trump paid $100 million. The aircraft was insured at a value of $35 million in 2011, records show, and aviation experts say it is currently worth about $18 million. Boeing no longer makes 757s, but a 2015 Boeing Business Jet would sell for approximately $80 million, and cost anywhere from $20 million to $40 million to outfit. After Mr. Trump took possession of the 757 in 2011 he made a number of changes but did not fundamentally undo Mr. Allenâ€™s initial renovation, records show. For instance, he kept the headboard in the master bedroom, as well as most of the chairs, couches and toilet seats Mr. Allen had left, choosing to reupholster them. Greg Raiff, chief executive officer of Private Jet Services, an aviation consulting firm and   charter broker for corporations and individuals, said the Boeing was an unusual aircraft for a man of Mr. Trumpâ€™s wealth. â€œBuying a    757 is like buying a bag of Cheetos. Itâ€™s a lot of food for a low price,â€ he said. The Cessna was previously owned by NetJets, an aircraft company that caters to the nationâ€™s wealthiest people, and has flown more than other planes its age, records show. It was worth $15. 3 million new and has a current resale value of approximately $3. 2 million, according to an estimate by Vref Publishing, a company that supplies information about aircraft values. The Times paid Vref to value the plane based on publicly available information. Mr. Trumpâ€™s three other aircraft are helicopters. Two of those are 1989 Sikorsky   one of which was used to give rides to children at the Iowa State Fair. Mr. Trump took possession of the other 1989 in August 2014. It has logged only a handful of flights with the F. A. A. since he took possession, records show, though not all chopper flights are logged with the federal regulator. One notable trip that it received clearance to make was on New Yearâ€™s Eve in 2015, when, records show, it was given authorization to fly to Nassau, in the Bahamas, from West Palm Beach, Fla. Both helicopters are worth approximately $875, 000, according to Vref. The third helicopter, a 1990 Sikorsky   was purchased in March 2012 and is currently worth roughly $940, 000. The Trump Organization has used pictures of it to help market its golf courses. It was shipped to Scotland in 2015, for the use of clients of Trump Turnberry Resort in Scotland. â€œThe skyâ€™s the limit at Trump Turnberry, with exclusive helicopter charter now available for guests for quick and seamless travel to destinations across Scotland and beyond,â€ the resortâ€™s website reads.", "output": "1.

In doing so, Trump is breaking with longtime U.S. policy and potentially threatening regional stability, despite warnings from Western and Arab allies.  Why is President Trump planning to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and move the embassy there? There has long been pressure from pro-Israel politicians in the United States to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and Trump made it a signature promise of his campaign during the 2016 presidential election.  It is a decision that will likely be popular with many conservative and evangelical Christians in his political base. Many of them support political recognition of Israel s claim to the city. Vice President Mike Pence and David Friedman, the ambassador to Israel appointed by Trump, are thought to have pushed hard for both recognition and embassy relocation.  Why does Jerusalem play such an important role in the Middle East conflict? Religion, politics and history.  Jerusalem is a city that is sacred to three of the great monotheistic faiths: Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and each has sites of great religious significance there. It has been fought over for millennia by its inhabitants, by invading Romans, Crusaders, Ottomans and the British Empire, and by the modern states of Israel and its Arab neighbors.  Israel s government regards Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of the country, although that is not recognized internationally.  Palestinians feel equally strongly, saying that East Jerusalem must be the capital of an eventual Palestinian state. The city even has different names. Jews call it Jerusalem, or Yerushalayim, and Arabs call it Al-Quds, which means  The Holy .  But the city s significance goes beyond the two parties most immediately involved.  At the heart of Jerusalem s Old City is the hill which is known to Jews across the world as Har ha-Bayit, or Temple Mount, and to Muslims internationally as al-Haram al-Sharif, or The Noble Sanctuary.  It was home to the Jewish temples of antiquity but all that remains of them above ground is a restraining wall for the foundations built by Herod the Great. Known as the Western Wall, this is a sacred place of prayer for Jews.  Within yards of the wall, and overlooking it, are two Muslim holy places, the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which was built in the 8th century. Muslims regard the site as the third holiest in Islam, after Mecca and Medina.  The city is also an important pilgrimage site for Christians, who revere it as the place where they believe that Jesus Christ preached, died and was resurrected.  What is the city s status now and does any other country have an embassy in Jerusalem? When British rule ended in 1948, Jordanian forces occupied the Old City and Arab East Jerusalem. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally.  In 1980 the Israeli parliament passed a law declaring the  complete and united  city of Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel, but the United Nations regards East Jerusalem as occupied, and the city s status as disputed until resolved by negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.  Other countries have had embassies in Jerusalem in the past, but moved them out of the city some years ago. The King of Jordan retains a role in ensuring the upkeep of the Muslim holy places.  What is likely to happen next? Has Jerusalem been a flashpoint before? Tensions are running high in Jerusalem, and violence has erupted before over matters of sovereignty and religion.  In 1969 an Australian Messianic Christian tried to burn down the Al-Aqsa Mosque. He failed, but caused damage. So charged was the Middle East s political climate", "output": "1. True"}

In the western city of Kisumu, around 2,000 demonstrators marched on the election board offices, witnesses said, heeding Raila Odinga s appeal for protests against Thursday s repeat presidential ballot, before dispersing peacefully. Odinga is boycotting the contest against incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta. He says it will not be free and fair as the election board had made insufficient progress towards reforms he demanded after the original election held in August was annulled. Odinga had urged his supporters to ensure the new vote did not take place, repeatedly saying there would be  no elections . But on Tuesday he told the BBC he was not calling for protests on election day itself.  We have not told people to protest on polling day. We have not said that at all. We have told people to stay away,  he said in a radio interview. When called for clarification, Odinga s spokesman said he was saying  peaceful protests  would still take place and that the opposition would fully explain their plans on Wednesday.  At least 49 people have died in political violence since the August ballot, evoking unwelcome memories of the aftermath of a disputed 2007 vote, when more than 1,200 people were killed.  On Tuesday evening, the bodyguard of the deputy chief justice was shot and wounded as he bought flowers by the side of the road, police said.  The motive for the shooting was unclear, but it is likely to add to the tense atmosphere surrounding the vote. Judges have received threats since they nullified the August result.  The political stand-off has blunted growth in East Africa s richest economy, a nation which values its stability and relative freedom in a region plagued by conflict.  Kenya s Supreme Court is still hearing several cases challenging the legality of Thursday s election.  One, brought by human rights activist Khelef Khalifa and two others, seeks to delay the vote on grounds that the election board is not sufficiently prepared. The Supreme Court, the only body that can now legally postpone the poll beyond the end of the month, will hear the case on Wednesday.  On Tuesday, the election board canceled a planned briefing with journalists on preparations for the polls.  Last week, the head of the election board said it was not clear a free and fair vote could take place due to intimidation and political interference. He spoke after the resignation of an election commissioner, who then fled the country and released a statement saying she had been threatened, although she did not say by whom.  A day before the Aug. 8 vote, another member of the election board was found tortured and murdered. On Monday, the International Crisis Group, a global think-tank, called for a delay in the election.  Proceeding under current conditions would deepen Kenya s ethnic cleavages and prolong a stalemate that has already claimed dozens of lives and come at a high economic cost,  it said.  Both the election board and the government have said the vote will go ahead, irrespective of whether Odinga contests it, and only a court ruling could legally delay the re-run ballot beyond the end of October.  On Tuesday, police fired teargas and bullets into the air to break up protesters in the capital Nairobi. In Kisumu, an Odinga stronghold, demonstrators said that the polls should not take place, but were unclear on how they should be stopped.   All we know is that there will be no elections. As to how this will be done, we are waiting for the big announcement by Baba (Odinga) tomorrow,  said one demonstrator, market trader James Ouma.  Around him, marchers waved branches and blew whistles. Last week Odinga supporters disrupted at least three official pre-polling events. Police said some election board staff were seriously injured.

The news is fake,â€ Trump told a news conference, referring to media reports that his presidential campaign team had contacts with Russian intelligence officials.  Trump, who frequently assailed the news media, also said he had not directed his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to talk to Russiaâ€™s ambassador about U.S. sanctions before taking office. Trump said he had asked the Justice Department to look into the leaks of â€œclassified information that was given illegallyâ€ to journalists regarding the relationship between his aides and Russia.  He also said he did not think that Russian President Vladimir Putin was taking actions that would test him early in his term in office. Trump, who took office on Jan. 20 and has voiced support for improved ties with Russia, added he personally had no business deals in that country. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that phone call records and intercepted calls showed members of Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the Nov. 8 election in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.     Pressed by reporters about whether he was aware if any member of his presidential campaign team had contacts with Russia before the election, the Republican president said: â€œNobody that I know of.â€ Wary Democratic lawmakers challenged Republicans, who control Congress, on Thursday to conduct a credible investigation into contacts between Trumpâ€™s associates and Russia. The process could take months and might never be made public. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trumpâ€™s favor. Trump has spoken admiringly of Putin, who had a tense relationship with former President Barack Obama over Moscowâ€™s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, Russian military actions in Syria and other matters. Even fellow Republicans have expressed unease about Trumpâ€™s comments about Putin. Flynn, a close adviser to Trump during his campaign, was seen by Moscow as a leading advocate of warmer ties with Russia. Trump fired Flynn on Monday after the retired lieutenant general misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States, before Trump took office, regarding U.S. sanctions on Moscow. Flynn told FBI agents last month he had not discussed sanctions against Russia with the ambassador before Trump took office, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. Flynnâ€™s Jan. 24 interview with the FBI could expose him to charges, since lying to the agency is a felony, but any decision to prosecute would lie with the Justice Department. U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted Flynnâ€™s call with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak after Trumpâ€™s election, in which the two discussed sanctions, the Post reported previously. Obama imposed the new sanctions on Russia on Dec. 29 after the U.S. intelligence communityâ€™s conclusion about Moscowâ€™s interference in the election campaign. A U.S. official familiar with the transcripts of the calls with the ambassador said Flynn indicated that if Russia did not retaliate, that could smooth the way toward a broader discussion of improving U.S.-Russian relations once Trump took power. That was potentially illegal under a law barring unauthorized private citizens from interfering in disputes the United States has with other countries. Trump forcefully defended Flynnâ€™s discussion with the Russian ambassador. â€œWhat he did wasnâ€™t wrong,â€ Trump told the news conference.  â€œMike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. ... I didnâ€™t direct him, but I would have directed him because thatâ€™s his job,â€ Trump said. â€œNo, I didnâ€™t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didnâ€™t do it. OK?â€ said Trump, who added the problem was Flynnâ€™s having misled Pence. A wealthy new York real estate developer with global business interests, Trump also portrayed himself as having no ties to Russia. â€œI can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I donâ€™t have any deals in Russia,â€ Trump said. Critics of the president have called on him since the election campaign to release his tax returns, saying that would shed more light on his business dealings. Trump has said he will not do so while his tax affairs are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. â€œI have nothing to do with Russia, havenâ€™t made a phone call to Russia in years, donâ€™t speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldnâ€™t. I just have nobody to speak to,â€ Trump said.", "output": "1. True"}

Els, who won the last of his four major at the British Open at Royal Lytham  St. Annes Golf Club in 2012 at age 42, points out, â€œIf players like myself, Darren Clarke and Mark Oâ€™Meara won (majors) in our 40s, surely Tiger thinks he can do it too.

I would love to see him play like he did back in the 90s, but I am not sure that is going to happen,â€ Els told reporters on Wednesday. Certainly, there are a number of events he likes and no one exemplifies the idea of â€œhorses for coursesâ€ more than Tiger. Woods has dominated more golf courses than any golfer in the history of the sport. Heâ€™s won at least four times on the same course at seven different Tour stops: Cog Hill (former home of the BMW Championship) Firestone (WGC Bridgestone) Doral (WGC Cadillac) Muirfield Village (the Memorial) Bay Hill (Arnold Palmer Invitational) Augusta National (the Masters) and Torrey Pines (Farmers Insurance Open). The South African knows where his bread is buttered and who has held the spreader for the last couple of decades. â€œWe would not be playing for the money we play for if it wasnâ€™t for Tiger, so we have to thank him for that, for what he has done for the game and it can only be good if he plays well. â€ Els praised Tiger for his achievements, observing that â€œItâ€™s been 20 years since he won his first major at the Masters and itâ€™s quite amazing what he has achieved. â€ He added, Woods â€œhas won 14 majors in that span and he was injured for at least three or four of those seasons, so itâ€™s really a major for every year he has been healthy as a professional.

Trump, a climate change doubter, campaigned on a pledge to boost the U.S. oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries by slashing regulation. He also promised to pull Washington out of a global pact to fight climate change. The first page to be updated is one that reflects Trumpâ€™s executive order on energy independence, which calls for a review of the Clean Power Plan put into place by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, the statement said. â€œLanguage associated with the Clean Power Plan, written by the last administration, is out of date,â€ it said. â€œSimilarly, content related to climate and regulation is also being reviewed.â€ The Clean Power Plan aimed to sharply reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electrical power generation over 25 years, focusing on reductions from coal-burning power plants and increasing the use of renewable energy and energy conservation. â€œWe want to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how weâ€™re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law,â€ J.P. Freire, associate administrator for public affairs at the agency, said in the statement. The website changes will comply with agency ethics and legal guidance, including proper archiving, so a snapshot of the Obama administrationâ€™s website would remain available from the main page, the statement said. In January, EPA sources told Reuters that administration officials had asked the agency to take down the climate change page on its website, and that EPA staff had pushed back in an effort to convince the administration to preserve it. [L1N1FF00N] The page includes links to scientific research, emissions data from industrial plants and a multi-agency report that describes trends related to the causes and effects of climate change. Pruitt led 14 lawsuits against the agency when he was Oklahomaâ€™s attorney general. Last month he said he was not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change, a position widely embraced by scientists.

U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel s capital, generating outrage from Palestinians. Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Countries around the world, including U.S. allies Britain and France, criticized Trump s decision, but India did not take sides. Instead, the Indian foreign ministry in a brief statement, said India s position was consistent and independent of any third party.  The bland statement made no reference to Jerusalem and prompted criticism at home that it was insufficient, vague and anti-Palestinian. Israel maintains that all of Jerusalem is its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state and say Trump s move has left them marginalized and jeopardized any hopes of a two-state solution.  Last week, envoys from Arab states including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kuwait based in New Delhi met Indian junior foreign minister M.J. Akbar to brief the government about an Arab League meeting on Dec. 9 condemning the U.S. decision, a diplomatic and an Indian government source said. The envoys also sought a more forthright Indian response, the sources said.  But Akbar gave no assurance and the Indian source said the government had no plans for a further articulation on Jerusalem, which is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Akbar did not promise anything,  the diplomatic source briefed on the meeting said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities.  India was one of the earliest and vocal champions of the Palestinian cause during the days it was leading the Non-Aligned Movement while it quietly pursued ties with Israel. But under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, New Delhi has moved to a more open relationship with Israel, lifting the curtain on thriving military ties and also homeland security cooperation. Modi s Hindu nationalist ruling group views Israel and India as bound together in a common fight against Islamist militancy and long called for a public embrace of Israel.  Modi in July made a first trip to Israel by an Indian prime minister and did not go to Ramallah, the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority and a customary stop for leaders trying to maintain a balance in political ties. P.R. Kumaraswamy, a leading Indian expert on ties with Israel at New Delhi s Jawaharlal Nehru University, said a  major shift  on India s policy had been evident since early this year when Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas visited New Delhi.  With the Palestinian president standing by his side, Prime Minister Modi reiterated India s support for Palestinian statehood but carefully avoided any direct reference to East Jerusalem,  he said.  For decades, India s support for a Palestinian state was accompanied by an explicit reference to East Jerusalem being the Palestinian capital. But Delhi has moved to a more balanced position, refusing to take sides in an explosive dispute, he said. During the meeting last week, the ambassadors of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Somalia and the Palestinian Authority spoke, the diplomatic source said. Besides the dozen envoys there were charges d affaires from several other countries in the region.    They were expecting more from India, perhaps to denounce Israel and the U.S.  said former Indian ambassador to Jordan and Anil Trigunayat.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Donald Trumpâ€™s flailing campaign has prompted Democrats to launch a new, broad effort to offer Hillary Clinton as a safe harbor for Republicans who find they can no longer stomach the GOP presidential nominee.\n\nClintonâ€™s campaign is quietly broadening its outreach to potential Republican converts, including donors, elected officials, and business and foreign policy leaders. The message is simple: Even if you have never before considered voting for a Democrat, and even if you donâ€™t like Clinton, choosing her this year is a moral and patriotic imperative.\n\nâ€œDuty, honor, country,â€ is how one person familiar with recent campaign outreach put it.\n\nThe recruitment is a continuation of the campaignâ€™s efforts to sway influential Republicans and independents, which began in earnest as Trump appeared likely to secure the GOP nomination during the spring.\n\nIt escalated during and after the Republican convention, which drew fewer senior elected Republicans than usual and included scenes of discord. Trump himself helped the Clinton cause most with remarks on the economy and foreign policy during and after the Democratic convention, Clinton aides said. Chief among those was a public feud with the family of a Muslim soldier, Humayun Khan, who died in battle in Iraq.\n\nThis week, his refusal to endorse House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin or Sen. John McCain of Arizona during their primaries this month has further alienated mainstream conservatives and Republican establishment figures.\n\nThe Clinton campaign would not discuss the recruitment effort in detail, including specific additional targets among Republican elected officials or other leaders. But according to several Democrats with knowledge of the effort, it includes personal appeals to target luminaries by senior Democrats including John Podesta, Clintonâ€™s campaign chairman. The campaign is also tracking Republicans who have spoken out against Trump in public even if they have stopped short of endorsing Clinton.\n\nThe idea is to make Republican voters more comfortable supporting Clinton by showing them examples of leaders in many realms who have chosen to disavow Trump as a matter of principle. The effort combines Clinton campaign staff and resources with outside go-betweens, Clinton officials said.\n\nâ€œWhen you look at what went on at the Republican convention, and then in contrast the Democratic convention, for a lot of Republicans this was their moment to take that close look at the two candidates,â€ Clinton chief strategist and pollster Joel Benenson said.\n\nâ€œA lot of people are waking up and saying: â€˜What am I doing here? Letâ€™s see what I hear on the other side.â€™ They have to look for a place to land thatâ€™s in the best interest of the country.â€\n\nBenenson noted that Republicans themselves have begun an â€œorganicâ€ effort to encourage one another to reject Trump.\n\nSeveral Republicans were among a group of former cabinet officers, senior officials and career military officers who denounced Trump on Thursday, calling his recent remarks on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia â€œdisgraceful.â€\n\nThe open letter takes issue with Trump statements that appear to question the alliance, encourage Russia to hack and release Clintonâ€™s deleted State Department emails, and seem to recognize Russiaâ€™s annexation of Crimea, which the United States considers illegitimate. The letter does not endorse Clinton, although several of the individual signers have done so separately.\n\nâ€œThere are people, Republicans, saying itâ€™s time to put country before party. Thatâ€™s not a thing any Democrat can say to a Republican. Thatâ€™s something only a Republican can say to a Republican,â€ Benenson said in an interview.\n\nThe Clinton campaign invited several Republicans to make that argument at the Democratic convention last week, including Douglas G. Elmets, a White House spokesman under former president Ronald Reagan.\n\nâ€œTrump appeals to our basest instincts, our worst selves,â€ said Elmets, who has taken it upon himself to write op-eds, appear on television and speak out in other ways to encourage other Republicans to support Clinton.\n\nElmets said he was asked to speak at the convention by a friend active in Democratic politics in California who acted as a go-between with convention organizers.\n\nâ€œAt the end of the day, I can see the fish rotting at the head,â€ said Elmets, referring to Trumpâ€™s effect on the Republican Party.\n\nSince the close of the convention, Clinton secured the public endorsement of entrepreneur, sports team owner and reality TV personality Mark Cuban, who had earlier indicated that he might vote for Trump. She was also endorsed by Hewlett-Packard executive and Republican fundraiser Meg Whitman. More are in the works, including Republicans who have held senior foreign policy roles in the executive branch and Congress, Democrats familiar with the effort said.\n\nIn addition, retiring Rep. Richard Hanna of New York became the first sitting Republican member of Congress to endorse Clinton this week. Senior campaign aides to former Florida governor Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, two former GOP candidates, also said they are backing Clinton.\n\nIt remains unclear whether trotting out Republican endorsers will translate to significantly more Republican support at the polls.\n\nIn the battleground state of North Carolina, Clinton is likely to have a tough time courting Republicans, but â€œitâ€™s probably worth the effort,â€ said Carter Wrenn, a longtime GOP strategist. Wrenn estimated about 20 percent of Republicans there â€œdonâ€™t like Hillary at all, but they donâ€™t care for Trump either.â€\n\nâ€œThe question is whether they pass on the presidential race entirely,â€ Wrenn said. â€œI donâ€™t think Hillary is going to get many Republican votes, and I think she knows that.â€ But just neutralizing those voters, he said, could be helpful in a race that is most likely to be decided by which candidate can better mobilize independents.\n\nCampaign officials and close Clinton allies cautioned that the Republican outreach is not a foundation for her election strategy, which focuses chiefly on women, Hispanics and younger voters, and holding onto the battleground states President Obama won in 2012.\n\nâ€œWeâ€™re not going to forget where we came from, but we know there is a window to reach beyond our traditional supporters, and weâ€™re going to try very hard to reach these folks,â€ a Clinton aide said.\n\nIt is also worth noting that even as Democrats court Republicans, the candidate is pressing ahead on the campaign trail with a jobs-and-economy message that keeps her out of the way of the damaging news coverage Trump has brought upon himself.\n\nAnd they say they are not taking victory for granted even as they seize on this new opportunity. Clinton strategists do not expect that the double-digit lead she has opened in some battleground state polls this week will last.\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton were described as â€œcircumspectâ€ and â€œnot giddyâ€ by a person who spoke to them recently.\n\nâ€œEveryone just assumes this is a slog,â€ that person said.\n\nBut the campaign and its outside allies are feeling more confident with roughly three months to go before the election.\n\nThe pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA did not renew its ads in Colorado and Virginia. Spokesman Justin Barasky said the PAC plans to return to the airwaves in both battleground states at the end of the month, but the lapse is a sign that both the campaign and PAC view the two states as safer than before.\n\nOn Thursday, Clinton visited an energy company founded by a prominent local Republican in Nevada. Clinton used the stop at Mojave Electric to highlight a piece of her jobs plan that would reward businesses such as owner Dennis Nelsonâ€™s with a $1,500 tax credit for each apprentice they hire.\n\nEarlier this week, she toured a small necktie manufacturer in Colorado to tout American manufacturing and zing Trump for making his Trump-branded ties overseas.\n\nBut Trumpâ€™s tough week has been met by relative silence on the Clinton trail. The principle is to let Trump dominate the news cycle, while Clinton garners local headlines on her jobs plan.\n\nAfter the Denver stop on Wednesday, for example, the Denver Postâ€™s three-column, front-page headline read, â€œClinton pledges millions of jobs.â€\n\nâ€œWhenever any political candidate is doing damage to themselves every day, the wisest course of action is â€” within reasonable limits â€” to stay out of the news and allow the other candidate to continue to do damage,â€ said Jerry Crawford, a longtime Clinton ally.\n\nAfter appearing with Clinton at a rally in Las Vegas, Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) warned Democrats not to be overconfident. But, citing recent polling, he said Clintonâ€™s electoral map has the potential to extend to deeply red states.\n\nReid said Georgia, Arizona and Utah are three states where Clinton could potentially do well in the race against Trump.\n\nâ€œI hope the map is expanded,â€ Reid told reporters. â€œIt would be good for the country.â€\n\nAccording to a person close to a pro-Clinton super PAC, the outlook for the fall has not changed significantly since the conventions, and they expect Clintonâ€™s bump in the polls and Trumpâ€™s rough patch to both level off.\n\nHer allies view the task of electing a Democrat to three consecutive presidential terms as monumental, making a landslide election rare in recent history and unlikely for Clinton â€” even against Trump. It is particularly difficult, they say, given that more than half of Americans have said in recent polling that the country is on the wrong track.\n\nâ€œWe are sailing into spectacular head winds,â€ the person said.", "output": "1.

Despite the conviction and four other charges of corruption, the leftist icon and former labor union leader remains Brazil s most popular politician and is leading early opinion polls ahead of next year s poll. Brazil s benchmark Bovespa stock index rallied on the news, first reported on the website of newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, to close 1.4 percent higher.  Investors had been wary that a delay in the appeals court decision until later next year would give Lula more time to consolidate himself as the front-runner in the campaign, making it harder for judges to bar his candidacy.  Lula s lawyers criticized the  record  speed at which the appeals process was being brought to a decision. If the TRF-4 regional appeals court in Porto Alegre upholds the conviction, Lula can appeal to higher courts, but he would be blacklisted and unable to run for office. A Datafolha survey published on Dec. 2 showed Lula gaining at least 34 percent of the votes if the election were held today, double the support for his nearest rival. It also showed him winning a runoff against likely contenders, Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin, far-right Congressman Jair Bolsonaro or environmentalist Marina Silva. Lula was Brazil s first working-class president and millions of Brazilians were lifted from poverty by social programs introduced during his two terms in office from 2003-2010. His handpicked successor Dilma Rousseff was impeached last year for breaking budget laws, ending 13 years of rule by Lula s Workers Party. Critics say his legacy was Brazil s worst economic recession and its biggest corruption scandal. Lula was sentenced in July to nearly 10 years in jail for accepting 3.7 million reais ($1.1 million) in bribes from an engineering firm in return for help winning public contracts. Prosecutors said the money was spent refurbishing a beach resort apartment for him. In recent months, Lula has toured Brazil as if he were already campaigning, rallying crowds of supporters in rural areas that benefited from his poverty relief programs.

Authorities had sought to remove Guevara s congressional immunity so that he could be tried for instigating violence. The opposition and local media said that Sebin intelligence agents had surrounded Guevara s house over the weekend.  Guevara, a 31-year-old who runs the hardline Popular Will party and is also the deputy leader of congress, entered the residence on Saturday and requested protection, the Chilean government said in a statement.  Guevara could become the highest-profile Venezuelan politician to seek exile in recent years.  A majority of opposition leaders are now unable to challenge unpopular Maduro, a 54-year-old former bus driver and foreign minister whom they blame for the oil-rich nation s economic downfall.  Anti-Maduro politicians have been barred from holding office, like two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles; arrested or placed under house arrest, like opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez; or threatened with trial, like congress leader Julio Borges who could face treason charges for lobbying against Venezuela s government in global financial circles.  The opposition coalition condemned the threats against Guevara as another sign that Maduro has turned the OPEC member into a dictatorship.       This is an arbitrary and political decision that seeks to weaken a congress that has the full support of the people. Venezuela is hungry for food, but also freedom, justice and dignity,  said Borges at a news conference on Sunday.   Freddy Guevara has taken a personal decision. In my case I have to keep doing what I have to do,  added Borges, who did not offer details on Guevara s arrival at the residence.  Authorities on Sunday mocked Guevara, a fiery former student leader, for taking refuge at the embassy.   Some people are very brave when it comes to calling for and provoking violence, destruction, and death. But when justice is done, they flee with embarrassing cowardice,  tweeted Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza.   Guevara was often on the front lines of sometimes violent protests earlier this year to demand early elections, humanitarian aid to alleviate hunger, freedom for jailed dissidents, and respect for the opposition-led congress.  The government says counters demonstrations were in fact a U.S.-backed  armed insurrection  designed to oust Maduro. Authorities say opposition politicians are responsible for the around 125 deaths during four months of unrest, and as such should face trial.  Amid the political crackdown, the Chilean residence in Caracas has played a significant role, taking in five magistrates named by the opposition-run congress after they were threatened with jail time, as well as another opposition politician from party COPEI.  The magistrates fled over the border to Colombia last month before flying to Santiago to be received by leftist Michelle Bachelet s government, which has joined a chorus of major Latin American nations in denouncing Maduro.

After 24 hours of trying to track him down, Nyasha Bakare said he had been found by his lawyers at a government detention center in Yaounde, the capital.  He s apparently OK.

A spokesman at the government s communications department was not immediately available to comment.  Last week the government ordered thousands of villagers to leave their homes in the Anglophone Southwest region as it deployed troops to root out armed separatists. The move marked an escalation of a year-long crackdown on peaceful protests in the English-speaking western part of the country that has killed dozens of civilians and forced thousands to flee to Nigeria.

Bannonâ€™s (or, to those who wish to maximize their SEO, Steve Bannon) beliefs based on his public statements  â€”   past interviews, speeches, and films. [From Quartz:  The three tenets of Bannonism, Bannonâ€™s political philosophy boils down to three things that a Western country, and America in particular, needs to be successful: Capitalism, nationalism, and â€œ  values. â€ These are all deeply related, and essential. America, says Bannon, is suffering a â€œcrisis of capitalism. â€ (He uses the word â€œcrisisâ€ a lot â€”  more on that later.) Capitalism used to be all about moderation, an entrepreneurial American spirit, and respect for oneâ€™s fellow Christian man. In fact, in remarks delivered to the Vatican in 2014, Bannon says that this â€œenlightened capitalismâ€ was the â€œunderlying principleâ€ that allowed the US to escape the â€œbarbarismâ€ of the 20th century. Since this enlightened era, things have gradually gotten worse. (Hence the â€œcrisis. â€) The downward trend began with the 1960s and â€™70s counterculture. â€œThe baby boomers are the most spoiled, most   most narcissistic generation the countryâ€™s ever produced,â€ says Bannon in a 2011 interview. He takes on this issue in more detail in Generation Zero, a 2010 documentary he wrote and directed. The film shows one interviewee after another laying out how the â€œcapitalist systemâ€ was slowly undermined and destroyed by a generation of wealthy young kids who had their material needs taken care of by hardworking parents â€”  whose values were shaped by the hardship of the Great Depression and World War II â€”  only to cast off the American values that had created that wealth in the first place. This shift gave rise to socialist policies that encouraged dependency on the government, weakening capitalism. Eventually, this socialist vision succeeded in infiltrating the very highest levels of institutional power in America. â€œBy the late 1990s, the left had taken over many of the institutions of power, meaning government, media, and academe,â€ says Peter Schweizer, a writer affiliated with Bannonâ€™s Government Accountability Institute, a conservative think tank, in Generation Zero. â€œAnd it was from these places and positions of power that they were able to disrupt the system and implement a strategy that was designed to ultimately undermine the capitalist system. â€ (As he says â€œundermine the capitalist system,â€ the film zooms in on the word â€œLuciferâ€ in that   epigraph from Saul Alinsky.) Underlying all of this is the philosophy of Edmund Burke, an influential   Irish political thinker whom Bannon occasionally references. In Reflections on the Revolution in France, Burke presents his view that the basis of a successful society should not be abstract notions like human rights, social justice, or equality. Rather, societies work best when traditions that have been shown to work are passed from generation to generation. The baby boomers, Bannon says in a lecture given to the Liberty Restoration Foundation (LRF) failed to live up to that Burkean responsibility by abandoning the    values of their parents (nationalism, modesty, patriarchy, religion) in favor of new abstractions (pluralism, sexuality, egalitarianism, secularism). For both Burke and Bannon, failure to pass the torch results in social chaos. Read the rest of the story here.", "output": "1. True"}

The survivors told of fleeing, hiding, using their phones to plead for help, watching friends die  â€”   and thinking that they would also  â€”   as a man with an assault rifle and a handgun went through the Pulse nightclub, firing more shots than they could count. The slaughter early Sunday left 49 victims dead, in addition to the gunman, and 53 wounded  â€”   the worst mass shooting in American history. â€œThe guilt of feeling lucky to be alive is heavy,â€ said Patience Carter, who was shot in the legs and saw her friend Akyra Murray killed. â€œI was begging God to take the soul out of my body because I didnâ€™t want to feel any more pain, I didnâ€™t want any more shots. â€ More than 30 of the wounded remained in hospitals on Tuesday, including at least six who were in critical condition. All of the dead had been identified, and most of the autopsies were completed. As the injured and the doctors who treated them told their stories, the F. B. I. continued looking into the actions of the gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, who died in a shootout with police, seeking evidence of a motive and any possible accomplices  â€”   in particular, whether his wife may have known he was planning the assault. His wife, Noor Zahi Salman, has told investigators that she once drove him to the nightclub, that she was with him when he bought ammunition, and that she tried to talk him out of mounting an attack, law enforcement officials said. Mr. Mateen had voiced hatred of gays, minorities and Jews, and had claimed links to Islamist terrorist groups during the siege at the nightclub, he declared allegiance to the Islamic State. But investigators were also looking into reports that he might have been gay himself. His   Sitora Yusufiy, said that Mr. Mateen had told her that he had frequented nightclubs before their marriage, but had not described them as gay clubs. In Washington, President Obama on Tuesday reiterated that investigators had found no evidence that Mr. Mateen had actual contact with a larger terrorist group like the Islamic State. â€œIt is increasingly clear, however, that the killer took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet,â€ Mr. Obama said. He appears to have been an â€œangry, disturbed, unstable young man who became radicalized,â€ the president said. â€œThese lone actors or small cells of terrorists are very hard to detect and very hard to prevent,â€ Mr. Obama said. â€œWe are doing everything in our power to stop these kinds of attacks. â€ Referring to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, the president said: â€œI want to remind them that they are not alone. The American people and our allies, friends all over the world, stand with you and are thinking about you and are praying for you. â€ On Sunday, there were about 320 people, most of them Latino, in Pulse shortly after 2 a. m. when Mr. Mateen entered with an assault rifle similar to an   and a semiautomatic handgun. Angel Colon was exchanging goodbye hugs with friends when the shooting began, and like much of the panicked crowd he ran for the door. But three bullets hit his leg and he fell. â€œI tried to get back up but everyone started running everywhere  â€”   I got trampled over, and I shattered and broke my bones in my left leg,â€ he said at Orlando Regional Medical Center, where he was being treated. â€œAll I could do was just lay down while everyone was just running on top of me, trying to get to where they had to be. â€ He heard more gunshots and screaming as the gunman apparently went to a back room and then returned. â€œHeâ€™s shooting everyone thatâ€™s already dead on the floor, making sure theyâ€™re dead,â€ Mr. Colon said. â€œI look over, and he shoots the girl next to me. And Iâ€™m just there laying down and Iâ€™m thinking â€˜Iâ€™m next, Iâ€™m dead.â€™ So I donâ€™t know how, but by the glory of God, he shoots toward my head but it hits my hand, and then he shoots me again and it hits the side of my hip. I had no reaction. I was just prepared to just stay there laying down so he wonâ€™t know that Iâ€™m alive. â€ Then the killer traded gunfire with arriving police officers, retreating to another room. An officer entered, found Mr. Colon still alive, and dragged him through broken glass, cutting his back and legs, to the street and then to a nearby Wendyâ€™s, where, he recalled,â€œthereâ€™s just bodies everywhere. â€ â€œI wish I could remember his face or his name,â€ Mr. Colon said of the officer. â€œIâ€™m grateful for him. â€ Ms. Murray, 18, arrived in Orlando on Saturday from Philadelphia with her friends, Ms. Carter and Tiara Parker, on a trip to celebrate her high school graduation, and they had just ordered an Uber car to take them back to their hotel when they heard a barrage of gunfire. Ms. Carter said that she and Ms. Parker fled the club, then realized Ms. Murray was not with them and ran back inside to get her. By then, the way out was blocked, she said, and the three of them ran deeper into Pulse. Like a number of other people, including Angel Santiago Jr. they took shelter in a bathroom several including Ms. Carter and her friends, cowered in a large handicapped stall. She and Mr. Santiago told their stories to reporters on Tuesday at Florida Hospital, where they were being treated. â€œWe just continued to hear gunfire, and I just remember thinking, when is it going to stop?â€ Mr. Santiago said. â€œIt kept getting louder, closer, and I could actually start to smell, I donâ€™t know, I guess it was gunpowder. â€ Then the gunman entered, spraying the room with bullets, aiming primarily at the walls of the toilet stalls. â€œHe was shooting his machine gun, so weâ€™re all scrambling around the bathroom, screaming at the top of our lungs,â€ Ms. Carter said. â€œPeople were getting hit by bullets, blood is everywhere. â€ A bullet went through her right thigh, shattering the femur, and lodged in her left thigh both of her friends were also hit. Lying on the floor in a spreading pool of blood, she looked under the divider into the next stall. â€œI could see piles of bodies laying over the toilet seat and slumped over, and the bottom of the toilet was slumped over with handprints and blood,â€ she said. Turning her head in other directions, she saw more dead and wounded. â€œAt that point, I was just like, `I really donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to get out of here.â€™ â€ Mr. Santiago was shot in the left foot and right knee, and the friend he was with was more seriously hurt. The gunman left the room, he said, and â€œwe were just trying to be as quiet as possible because we didnâ€™t want to attract him back to us. â€ Unable to walk, Mr. Santiago dragged himself out of the bathroom, past prone and broken bodies, to the front room of the club, where he found police officers waiting. â€œI yelled, I said, â€˜There are people shot, people who are killed in the bathroom, we need help,â€™â€ he recalled. Mr. Mateen returned to the bathroom, and it was there, Ms. Carter said, that he called 911 to talk with the police, and she heard him pledge allegiance to the Islamic State. He said â€œthat the reason why heâ€™s doing this is because he wants America to stop bombing his country. â€ Later, he addressed his victims directly, asking if any of them were black, explaining: â€œYou know, I donâ€™t have a problem with black people. This is about my country. You guys have suffered enough. â€ He got angry when peopleâ€™s cellphones beeped or rang, and demanded that people turn them over, she said, and he made comments like â€œweâ€™ve got the snipers outsideâ€ indicating that he was not alone, or that he was talking with accomplices. After a   standoff, she heard explosions as the police started their final assault on the club, trying to blow a hole in an outer wall. His rifle had apparently jammed, she said, and he used the pistol to resume firing, shooting three people who lay on the floor. Someone  â€”   she did not know who  â€”   got between her and the gun, and was shot. â€œIt wasnâ€™t for that person shielding me, I would have been shot, I wouldnâ€™t be here,â€ she said. Doctors at Orlando Regional Medical Center said they ordinarily would get some warning that wounded were coming, as well as information about the number of patients and their conditions. But not in this case, with a chaotic mass shooting just blocks away. Patients arrived in trucks and cars, and on foot, as well as in ambulances. â€œWe quickly got about five patients, and that was a lot for us, and we thought maybe that was going to be it,â€ Dr. Kathryn Bondani said. â€œAnd then they started lining up in the hallway. â€   patients were taken to the medical center, the regionâ€™s only trauma center, and nine of them died quickly. No other patients have died since that night. Of the six patients in critical condition, Dr. Michael Cheatham said, â€œI suspect that they will survive, but my concern is that they will have lasting harm from this, in terms of their functionality. â€ On Monday night, thousands of people gathered on a grassy knoll in downtown Orlando for a candlelight vigil that was by turns defiant and melancholy. â€œWe have come together as a force here in Orlando that cannot be broken,â€ said Terry DeCarlo, the executive director of the L. G. B. T. Center of Central Florida. Mourners joined in the sports chant: â€œI believe that we will win. â€ But moments later, during about 10 minutes of silence, tears flowed and embraces tightened as the crowd lifted candles into the air and a church bell tolled. â€œNumb,â€ Elayane Merriwether, a    bartender who lost a   in the shooting, said of the cityâ€™s mood. â€œPeople just keep crying. People donâ€™t know what to say to each other. I think a lot of people are still in shock. â€", "output": "1. True"}

Many Republicans are unhappy with the deal President Donald Trump reached last week with Democratic leaders to raise the governmentâ€™s debt ceiling and allow it to continue financing federal spending programs until Dec. 8. In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Jordan, a Republican, appeared to cast blame for the debt ceiling hike on party leaders including Ryan, saying they had not provided any â€œgood optionsâ€ to Trump before he struck a deal with Democrats. â€œIn this situation, he (Trump) wasnâ€™t presented with good options,â€ said Jordan, co-founder and former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, the most conservative group in the House. â€œNo one is talking about changing the leadership,â€ Jordan told Fox. He said a Washington Post story last week that reported that conservatives had met with Ryan to express their dismay about the debt ceiling increase was â€œhardly news,â€ because the lawmakers meet with Ryan every week. Rebellious conservatives pushed out Republican John Boehner, Ryanâ€™s predecessor, as speaker in 2015. The new plan also authorized spending $15.25 billion in emergency disaster relief for the victims of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Ninety House Republicans, including many members of the Freedom Caucus, voted against the measure, which Trump has now signed into law. Conservatives have long called for coupling spending reforms with any measures that raise the U.S. debt ceiling. But the deal did the opposite, raising the ceiling and paying for hurricane relief without spending cuts elsewhere. Republican leaders had urged an 18-month extension of the debt ceiling, but Trump accepted the three-month extension  proposed by Democrats. Jordan said he believed Trump has the same vision and focus as the Freedom Caucus, which was to represent people who felt they had been forgotten by officials in Washington. If conservative options are presented to the president, â€œIâ€™m confident when that happens, he will pick those options that are conservative,â€ Jordan said.", "output": "1. True"}

Trump, declaring that he was hopelessly unprepared and temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief. Electing him, she said, would be a â€œhistoric mistake. â€ Speaking in a steady, modulated tone but lobbing some of the most fiery lines of her presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton painted Mr. Trump as a reckless, childish and uninformed amateur who was playing at the game of global statecraft. â€œThis is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes,â€ she said, â€œbecause itâ€™s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin. â€ Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign had grappled for weeks over how to handle Mr. Trump, seemed to find her footing as she addressed an audience in San Diego that laughed and cheered as she deconstructed Mr. Trumpâ€™s foreign policy pronouncements. They were, she said, â€œnot even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies. â€ The speech, which mixed biting sarcasm and somber assessments of the foreign crises of the Obama years, unfurled what is likely to be the core argument that Mrs. Clinton will carry into the general election. Her remarks were billed as a major foreign policy address, and she was flanked by a row of 19 American flags as majestic as those that often back Mr. Trump at his public events. Yet the speech was devoid of new policy prescriptions, and she skipped over difficult episodes during her tenure as secretary of state, including the NATO intervention in Libya and its bloody aftermath in Benghazi. Instead she borrowed a tactic from President Obama, reeling off zingers that are catnip to   channels. It won her the kind of sustained live coverage that Mr. Trump has enjoyed routinely but Mrs. Clinton has not, though the announcement by Speaker Paul D. Ryan that he planned to vote for Mr. Trump stole her thunder in the opening moments of the   address. She said she imagined Mr. Trump was â€œcomposing nasty tweetsâ€ about her even as she spoke. And indeed he was: â€œBad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton!â€ Mr. Trump wrote. â€œReading poorly from the teleprompter! She doesnâ€™t even look presidential. â€ But Mrs. Clinton sought to turn Mr. Trumpâ€™s prolific Twitter habit into an additional bullet point demonstrating that he was â€œunfitâ€ for the presidency, as she put it. She twice referred to the scene in the White House Situation Room where as secretary of state, she advised Mr. Obama on the raid on a compound in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden. â€œImagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making    decisions on behalf of the United States,â€ Mrs. Clinton said, eliciting cries of â€œNo!â€ from her audience. â€œImagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when heâ€™s angry, but Americaâ€™s entire arsenal. â€ In an interview with The New York Times during Mrs. Clintonâ€™s speech, Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s performance was â€œterribleâ€ and â€œpathetic. â€ He added: â€œIâ€™m not   at all. Iâ€™m the opposite of  . â€ For Mrs. Clinton, whose formal speeches tend to be earnest and laden with policy prescriptions, it was a striking departure  â€”   a rollicking political indictment that doubled as Mrs. Clintonâ€™s first   response to Mr. Trumpâ€™s drumbeat of criticism about her ethics and judgment during a   in public life. The speech came after weeks of study by Clinton aides to determine which attacks by Mr. Trumpâ€™s Republican rivals had not worked. It was studded with punch lines: Mr. Trump â€œdoesnâ€™t have a clue what heâ€™s talking about,â€ Mrs. Clinton said at one point. â€œDonald doesnâ€™t see the complexity,â€ she said at another. â€œThis isnâ€™t reality television,â€ she said of a Trump presidency. â€œThis is actual reality. â€ After her campaign had initially issued a tepid response to Mr. Trumpâ€™s proposal of defaulting on the national debt, calling the idea â€œrisky,â€ Mrs. Clinton said Thursday that such action would lead to â€œan economic catastrophe. â€ â€œHe believes we can treat the U. S. economy like one of his casinos,â€ she said. The speech was roughly 10 days in the making and written by Mrs. Clintonâ€™s speechwriters, Dan Schwerin and Megan Rooney, and top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, with outside advisers including Mr. Obamaâ€™s former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, reviewing a late draft. Ms. Rooney, a former State Department speechwriter, was perched on the arm of Mrs. Clintonâ€™s chair on a flight from Boston to San Diego on Wednesday night, making revisions on her laptop and making sure the lines echoed Mrs. Clintonâ€™s sardonic humor. The address was a meaty rebuttal to Democrats who had expressed concern that Mrs. Clintonâ€™s campaign lacked gumption in going after Mr. Trump, particularly because Mr. Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have relished opportunities to skewer him. By turns mocking and stern, Mrs. Clinton derided Mr. Trump for suggesting that Japan should acquire nuclear weapons to deter North Korea, that the United States should have walked away from the nuclear deal with Iran, and that â€œmaybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS. â€ â€œHe says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia,â€ Mrs. Clinton said. â€œAnd to top it off, he believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are, and I quote, a â€˜  country. â€™â€ In vivid strokes, Mrs. Clinton framed not just her case against Mr. Trump but the broader   debate in the election: She cast herself as the defender of an   world order against an insurgent who did not understand, let alone respect, the network of alliances the United States constructed after World War II to safeguard its interests. Mrs. Clinton presented herself as a   commander in chief, a fervent believer in America as an exceptional country, tested by her time in the Situation Room. She highlighted her ability to go â€œtoe to toeâ€ with leaders in Beijing and Moscow, contrasting that with what she said was Mr. Trumpâ€™s â€œbizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America. â€ â€œIâ€™ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants,â€ she said. â€œI just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who Americaâ€™s real friends are. â€ Even as she excoriated Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton kept a close eye on domestic politics. She noted, for example, that she understood the deep qualms that voters had with trade deals. Still, Mr. Trumpâ€™s threats to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, Mrs. Clinton said, would set off a trade war of the kind that deepened the Great Depression in the 1930s. Mrs. Clinton recited a handful of highlights from her time at the State Department, including her role in brokering a   between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in 2012 and rallying the world to impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. But she failed to flesh out her proposals for dealing with the Islamic State or the civil war in Syria. To Mrs. Clinton, such policy details were not as important as the    differences between her and Mr. Trump. â€œHe has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists, even though those are war crimes,â€ Mrs. Clinton said. â€œHe says he doesnâ€™t have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has, quote, â€˜a very good brain. â€™â€ â€œHe also said, â€˜I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.â€™ You know what?â€ she continued. â€œI donâ€™t believe him. â€ Mrs. Clinton ended her remarks on a more solemn note, arguing that Mr. Trumpâ€™s proposals, like barring Muslims from entering the United States, â€œcould fuel an ugly narrative about who we are. â€ Mr. Trump, she said, would undo decades of statecraft by Republicans and Democrats. Striking a bipartisan note, Mrs. Clinton recalled an advertisement Mr. Trump took out in newspapers in 1987, during the Reagan administration, â€œsaying that America lacked a backbone and that the world was, you guessed it, laughing at us. â€ â€œYouâ€™ve got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America and has felt that way for at least 30 years wants to be our president,â€ she said.", "output": "1.

In a surprise move on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew   and   bills from circulation, aiming to shrink the countryâ€™s vast, informal â€œblackâ€ economy. The cash market, which by some estimates amounts to 30 percent of the gross domestic product, is used by many Indians to avoid paying taxes and to pay bribes. For the next two weeks, citizens will be able to exchange 4, 000 rupees a day, or about $60. But they will have difficulty converting large cash holdings because they will have to declare them to the tax authorities. Money that cannot be exchanged will be, as officials put it, â€œextinguished. â€ The plan, top secret until Mr. Modiâ€™s announcement, was hailed by financial analysts as bold and potentially transformational for India. It is also a   experiment: Though other Indian leaders have withdrawn currency notes, none have reduced the countryâ€™s supply of cash so drastically or so abruptly. The two bills being withdrawn make up 80 percent of the cash in circulation. Many people on the street this week said they were stunned and angry. Brawls broke out in lines outside banks, where many had to stand for hours, uncertain whether the stockpile of bills would run out. â€œI am in a very foul mood, and for business, this government is not good at all,â€ said Ayush Singhal, 26, a trader in packing tape, whose shop was all but deserted after the currency was withdrawn. The Old Delhi wholesale market, one of the largest in Asia, operates almost entirely on a cash basis, Mr. Singhal said. â€œWe have to figure out some other way of conducting business,â€ Mr. Singhal said, his face grave. â€œFor now, I am at a loss for words. â€ Poor migrants to the city said the sudden move had stranded them without enough money to eat. Umeshwar Prasad Rao, a farmer, had traveled hundreds of miles to New Delhi so that his daughter could have an operation, carrying his life savings of 10, 000 rupees in   notes. Because he did not have a government identification card, Mr. Rao could not exchange the money for usable notes. By midday on Thursday his family had consumed nothing but tea. Scores of families sprawled on the sidewalk around the hospital, with similar complaints. â€œI am at my witsâ€™ end,â€ Mr. Rao said. He was hoping to get food from a charity. â€œOtherwise, we will be fasting,â€ he said. The people who help others unload â€œblack moneyâ€ were doing a booming business. Gold merchants saw the price for 10 ounces of gold nearly double, so eager were customers to dispose of their large bills. Nishant Verma, who runs a family jewelry shop, kept his doors open until 1 a. m. two nights in a row to accommodate what he called a â€œmad rush. â€ But the busiest of all were money launderers  â€”     who converted stacks of   bills to   notes for a   fee and      firms, which provide companies with cash for undeclared payments, or bribes, registering the sum as a loan or an advance. Other businesses might backdate the receipts, suggesting that the invalid bills were exchanged before Mr. Modiâ€™s announcement, said Ajay Shah, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. â€œThere is infinite ingenuity out there,â€ he said. Hospitals and crematories, which are exempted from the ban, may also turn a profit by exchanging large numbers of bills for a fee. Laborers also made money on Thursday by standing in lines at banks, saving the places of more wealthy people who preferred to use their time in other ways. Mr. Modi had warned that the public might suffer â€œtemporary hardshipsâ€ during the period when the   bills are exchanged for new ones. Businesses likely to lose the most are real estate agencies, doctorsâ€™ offices and other professionals who demand cash transactions. Experts said a period of disruption was a small price to pay to drain the informal economy. Global Financial Integrity, a Washington policy group, has estimated that India lost $344 billion in illicit outflows of money in the decade leading up to 2011. As the week progressed, though, some analysts began to express worry that the abrupt monetary shock would ripple through the economy, weakening consumer demand. Ila Patnaik, an economist, warned in an editorial in the Indian Express newspaper that payments are now likely to be held up and purchases likely to be postponed, potentially damaging the economy in 2016 and 2017. â€œAs long as things are going fine, we tend to ignore money,â€ she wrote. â€œBut when money is disrupted, this imposes a substantial disruption upon the working of the economy. â€", "output": "1.

Johnson told the British parliament s foreign affairs committee last Wednesday that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching people journalism, a statement that the Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity organization for which she works, said was incorrect.  Last week s remarks by the Foreign Secretary provide no justifiable basis on which to bring any additional charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe,  a spokesman for the British Foreign Office said.  While criticizing the Iranian case against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Foreign Secretary sought to explain that even the most extreme set of unproven Iranian allegations against her were insufficient reason for her detention and treatment.  Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager, is serving a five-year jail sentence after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran s clerical establishment. She was brought again into court on Saturday, three days after Johnson s remarks, and accused by a judge of  spreading propaganda against the regime .  She is not a journalist and has never trained journalists at the Thomson Reuters Foundation where she is project manager in my Media Development team,  Monique Villa, Thomson Reuters Foundation chief executive, said in a statement.  I see a direct correlation between this statement by Boris Johnson, who rightly condemned the treatment that Nazanin has received in Iran, and the fact that Nazanin was brought once again into Court on Saturday 4 November.  The charges against Nazanin were denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that is independent of Thomson Reuters and operates independently of Reuters News. Tulip Siddiq, a lawmaker for the opposition Labour Party, said Johnson had failed to retract his comments, which she said had undermined efforts to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe s release.  By suggesting Nazanin was in Iran  teaching people journalism , Boris Johnson has endangered the cause to secure her release,  Siddiq, who is the lawmaker for the area where Zaghari-Ratcliffe lived in London, said in an emailed statement.  The Foreign Secretary s failure to retract his comments to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee is unforgivable,  Siddiq said.  His comments were both untrue and unhelpful to her case.

The two are the final candidates to take leadership of the Conservative Party after David Cameron, who opted to step aside following the countryâ€™s vote to withdraw from the European Union. Whoever wins will be the first woman to lead Britain since Margaret Thatcher, and could be an outsider among the current clique of leading personalities in the Brexit drama. _____ 8. The implications of the Brexit vote also hung over the NATO summit meeting in Warsaw, where President Obama sought to dismiss fears that the   alliance could similarly unravel. But fissures among the members were evident over how to handle Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, the migrant crisis and terrorism fears. _____ 9. A lawsuit accusing Roger Ailes, the powerful Fox News chairman, of gender discrimination and sexual harassment sent shock waves through the media world. Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox host, says she was forced out of the network after rebuffing Mr. Ailesâ€™s sexual advances  â€”   allegations he denies. Regardless of the legal outcome, the lawsuit signals a big shift for a network whose commentators have often rebuked ideas of political correctness and feminism. _____ 10. â€œThe Night Of,â€ a new   series, debuts tonight on HBO (9 p. m.

The deal, signed in July, leases the port to a Chinese firm for 99 years and the tax concessions include an income tax holiday of up to 32 years. The port is near the main shipping route from Asia to Europe and likely to play a key role in China s  Belt and Road  initiative. The joint venture comprises the China Merchants Port Holdings, which holds a 70 percent stake, and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), which has the remaining 30 percent.  Today the parliament approved two motions... to grant certain tax incentives to those two companies operating the Hambantota port,  Ports Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe told Reuters. In the 225-member parliament 72 lawmakers backed the tax concessions and seven voted against. Many opposition deputies boycotted the vote. The government pressed ahead with the vote despite a suggestion from opposition lawmaker Dinesh Gunawardena, who suggested the measures should require a two-thirds majority, or more than 150 votes, given the strategic nature of the issue. Government and diplomatic sources have told Reuters that the United States, India and Japan had raised concerns that China might use the port as a naval base and could be a threat to security and stability in the Indian Ocean. An initial plan to give the Chinese firm an 80 percent stake triggered protests by trade unions and opposition groups, forcing the government to make some revisions that limit China s role to running commercial operations while retaining for Colombo oversight for broader security issues.  The government will hand over the port, built with Chinese loans at a cost of $1.5 billion, to the joint venture on Saturday and will receive $300 million, or around 30 percent of the deal, Samarasinghe said. He also said the SLPA and the Chinese firm had signed the lease agreement just before parliament s approval of the tax exemptions.  There has also been widespread public anger over plans for a 99-year lease of 15,000 acres (23 sq miles) to develop an industrial zone next to the port. This land lease is under negotiation.       The parliamentary vote came a day after Sri Lanka s Supreme Court set a date for Jan. 11 to rule on three petitions against the leasing of land around the port to China. Sri Lanka has said the Chinese firm will invest an additional $600 million to make Hambantota port operational and $1.12 billion from the deal will be used for debt repayment.

A tax bill in Congress to eliminate that exemption, plus tax breaks on advance refunding bonds used to lower interest costs, stunned the $3.8 trillion municipal debt market. U.S. Representative Randy Hultgren, an Illinois Republican and co-chair of the Congressional Municipal Finance Caucus, said a letter he and 20 other Congressmen signed to object to the proposals was aimed at highlighting the value of tax-free debt issuance. â€œItâ€™s really important for projects. Weâ€™ve seen multiple returns in jobs created,â€ he said, adding that supporters will continue to push to retain these tax exemptions as the bills work their way through Congress. The proposals are incompatible with President Donald Trumpâ€™s push for greater infrastructure investment, the letter stated. â€œThis change in policy contradicts the growing need of the federal government to rely more, not less, on states and municipalities, as well as the private sector, to help to finance needed infrastructure in a market driven, cost effective manner,â€ the letter said. It added that advance refunding of municipal debt issues  over the last five years will translate into saving taxpayers in every state billions of dollars in interest costs. Legislation that passed the House earlier this month, as well as a bill pending in the Senate would disallow states, cities, schools and other issuers from refinancing on a tax-exempt basis bonds that are more than 90 days from the date the debt can be bought back by an issuer. This is done by issuers in order to save money by taking advantage of lower market interest rates. Current refundings of debt within a 90-day call date window would remain tax-exempt.  The House bill would also yank the tax exemption for new private activity bonds (PABs) used by nonprofit organizations and governments to finance projects including hospitals, nursing homes, colleges, affordable housing, economic development, ports, toll roads and airports at lower costs. Tim Fisher, legislative and federal affairs coordinator for the Council of Development Finance Agencies, said the letter may help if and when a Congressional conference committee meets to hash out differences between the House and Senate bills. â€œ(The letter) is a good sign that shows certain House Republicans are willing to go on the record,â€ he said. The elimination of PABs would raise nearly $39 billion for the federal government between 2018 and 2027, while removing tax-exemption for advance refunding bonds would generate $17.3 billion over that time period, according to an estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation.", "output": "1.

Trump and President Obama have been unfailingly polite toward each other since the election. But with Mr. Trump staking out starkly different positions from Mr. Obama on Israel and other sensitive issues, and the president acting aggressively to protect his legacy, the two have become leaders of what amounts to dueling administrations. The split widened on Friday when the Obama administration abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote that condemned Israel for Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and allowed the resolution to pass. A day earlier, Mr. Trump had publicly demanded that Mr. Obama veto the measure, even intervening with Egypt at the request of Israel to pressure the administration to shelve the effort. â€œAs to the U. N.,â€ Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter after the vote, â€œthings will be different after Jan. 20. â€ It was the latest in a   series of Twitter posts and public statements over the last week in which Mr. Trump has weighed in on Israel, terrorism and nuclear proliferation  â€”   contradicting Mr. Obama and flouting the notion that the country can have only one president at a time. That longstanding principle has largely collapsed since the victory by Mr. Trump, who campaigned on a strategy of breaking all the rules and has continued to speak in unmodulated tones. â€œIn some ways, Trump is neutering the Obama administration,â€ said Douglas G. Brinkley, a professor of history and a presidential historian at Rice University in Houston. â€œTheyâ€™ve avoided personally attacking each other, but behind the scenes, theyâ€™re working to undermine each other, and I donâ€™t know how the American people benefit from that. â€ For its part, the Obama administration on Tuesday announced a permanent ban on offshore oil and gas drilling along wide areas of the Arctic and the Eastern Seaboard, invoking an obscure provision of a 1953 law, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, to claim that Mr. Trump had no power to reverse it. White House officials asserted a similar privilege in their decision not to veto the Security Council resolution. Israelâ€™s aggressive construction of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, they said, puts at risk a   solution to the   conflict. Mr. Trumpâ€™s opposition to the measure, and the likelihood that his administration will reverse the position, played no part in the decision, they said. â€œThereâ€™s one president at a time,â€ said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser. â€œThereâ€™s a principle here that the world understands who is speaking for the United States until January 20th, and who is speaking for the United States after January 20th. â€ In the last week, Mr. Trump has written on Twitter that the United States â€œmust greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capabilityâ€ accused China of an â€œunprecedented actâ€ in seizing a United States Navy underwater drone in the South China Sea and then, after the Pentagon and the Chinese negotiated the droneâ€™s return, suggested that the United States should â€œlet them keep it!â€ He condemned the deadly truck rampage at a Christmas market in Berlin as an â€œattack on humanity,â€ which he also said vindicated his proposed ban on immigration from countries plagued by Islamic extremism. On Friday, Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter post that the suspect in the attack had made a religiously motivated threat. â€œWhen will the U. S. and all countries, fight back?â€ he wrote. Mr. Trumpâ€™s pronouncements are often so vague and offhand that their   impact on policy is open to debate. But his intervention to press Egypt to delay the Security Council vote disrupted a sensitive diplomatic negotiation, and muddied perhaps Mr. Obamaâ€™s final opportunity to make a statement on the stalled Middle East peace process. When Egypt buckled, the same resolution was brought to a vote by four other countries on the Security Council: Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela. The United States watched the proceedings largely from the sidelines. On Friday morning, Mr. Obama, from his vacation home in Hawaii, directed his national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, to tell the ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, not to block the resolution. â€œIn a practical sense, the message this sends is that the Obama administration is over,â€ said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to both Egypt and Israel. â€œEverybody knows this resolution doesnâ€™t carry any weight. The assumption has to be that the Israeli government will take some retaliatory measures. Knowing that Trump is coming into office, and knowing that Trump tried to oppose this, they will do so with impunity. â€ This role reversal between the departing and incoming presidents deepened what was already an unsettled moment in American foreign policy: a sense that the White Houseâ€™s policies toward the worldâ€™s most troubled places had run out of steam and were about to change radically, but in ways that were wholly unpredictable. Mr. Trump has been careful to be respectful of his predecessor, and the  â€™s aides have said that the two men have spoken often. When people at his rallies jeer at the mention of Mr. Obamaâ€™s name, Mr. Trump hushes them  â€”   a courtesy he does not extend to his former opponent, Hillary Clinton. But Mr. Trump has shown little patience for the traditions of the interregnum between presidents. â€œPresident Obama and his team have been unbelievably gracious to the   and his team, but at the end of the day, heâ€™s not someone thatâ€™s going to sit back and wait,â€ Sean Spicer, whom Mr. Trump named on Thursday as White House press secretary, said on CNN. Noting the close alliance between Israel and the United States, Mr. Spicer said, â€œIt is something that we should protect, and he wanted to make it very clear that anything that undermined Israel, which is a great friend of the United States, he was going to make sure his voice was heard. â€ It is not unprecedented for future presidents to dip into foreign affairs before taking office. During his transition in 1968, Richard M. Nixon dispatched two aides, Henry A. Kissinger and Robert Ellsworth, to meet with Soviet officials to pass along his views on a nonproliferation treaty and a summit meeting, an idea that was being pushed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Nixon later wrote that he â€œdid not want to be boxed in by any decisions that were madeâ€ before he took office. More often, though, incoming presidents have been  . In December 1932, the departing president, Herbert Hoover, was deeply frustrated when Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had won a landslide victory a month earlier, declined to work with him on the issue of war debts owed to the United States by Britain and France. â€œGovernor Roosevelt considers it undesirable for him to assent to my suggestions for cooperative action,â€ he said. Eliot A. Cohen, a Republican foreign policy expert who worked in the George W. Bush administration and is a critic of Mr. Trump, said the   was still communicating in the style of a political candidate. â€œI donâ€™t think he has a good sense of how every word that comes out of his mouth can have real consequences,â€ he said. Whatever their frustrations about his interference, White House officials were careful not to criticize Mr. Trump after the Security Council vote. And in his Twitter message promising change at the United Nations, Mr. Trump pointedly did not criticize Mr. Obama or his administration. Still, Mr. Trump has shown no sign that he will surrender his Twitter account or curb his public statements in the next 28 days, which could lead to more mixed messages and tension with the White House. Experts have said Mr. Trump would do well to follow the example of his reticent predecessors. â€œThis is not politesse,â€ said Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian. â€œEven a   who has been in public life for a long time has not been fully briefed or fully staffed, and hence may be in a position to do this better once heâ€™s in the White House. â€ â€œWhatâ€™s the rush?â€ he said.", "output": "1.

Radical policy changes are required â€”  tough to do even in this era of aggressive executive orders. [House leaders are working on corporate tax reform that will close loopholes, lower rates to internationally competitive levels, and shift part of the tax burden onto imports. It has a decent chance of winning enough bipartisan support in the Senate, but much more needs to be done.  Still many large businesses and most small ones are organized as limited liability corporations and pay taxes through the personal tax code â€”  after corporate tax reform they would be saddled with effective rates above 40 percent while their corporate rivals pay half that rate or less. Congress only has so much tax writing bandwidth, and personal tax reform may be booted into next year. Also, Treasury   Steven Mnuchin has stated that upper income individuals will not see a reduction in their overall tax burden, but they pay more than 80 percent of the personal income taxes. Hence it remains a puzzle as to how taxes can be meaningfully cut to stimulate growth. Whenever and whatever congress ultimately decides, genuine tax relief will require bigger deficits. Those are an anathema to many Republicans and in any case donâ€™t guarantee growth. George W. Bush slashed personal income taxes, Barack Obama expanded entitlements, and both relied in some considerable measure on bigger deficits as opposed to pruning spending elsewhere. Yet, each presided over moribund recoveries. Trade deficits with China and on oil directly subtract $500 billion annually from the demand for American made goods and services, kill millions of jobs, stifle RD, and tax growth. Confronting China on trade with a 45 percent tariff alone wonâ€™t get Beijing to stop undervaluing its currency, subsidizing exports, and cease blocking market access for   goods and services. It can push back by harassing U. S. companies with operations in China and imposing new barriers on U. S. products, and more broadly by squeezing Taiwan, upping the ante on militarization of the South China Sea, and further enabling North Korea. Trump must gird for a broad crisis with China, deploy the full range of Americaâ€™s geopolitical and economic assets, and compel Beijing to reckon with the fact that their shaky economy cannot withstand an all front confrontation with the United States without risking the Communist Partyâ€™s grip on power. Energy and Interior Departments committed to opening up drilling in the eastern Gulf and off the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts â€”  and ending the endless federal harassment of shale producers â€”  could make America energy independent. However, as with many other issues, the lack of 60 Republican votes in the Senate will require guerrilla warfare to accomplish the results American voters deserve for awarding Trump the presidency. On the supply side, itâ€™s a lot more expensive to start a business and make things in America than in the 1980s and 90s, because of the growth of the regulatory state. Just compliance with labor market, health care, financial, environmental regulations and the like require hundreds of thousands of employees and cost businesses billions of dollars. Imposing an efficacy test on regulations â€”  requiring just what is absolutely needed to accomplish legitimate goals for protecting workers, the environment, consumers and financial stability, and then jettisoning the rest â€”  should be the overarching objective as Trumpâ€™s cabinet goes to work at Labor, EPA, Treasury and elsewhere in the far flung federal regulatory apparatus. A good deal of what Obama imposed was by fiat â€”  executive orders that can now be repealed. However, he also imposed overly aggressive and burdensome regulations established under statutes, and those are more difficult and time consuming to nix. Just as the law required the Obama administration to publish and take public comment on proposed regulations before imposing new rules â€”  and then endure legal challenges from businesses and Republican state officials â€”  the Trump administration will have to repeat those steps and face litigation from environmental groups, labor unions, and Democratic governors. All can be axed or reshaped by congress, but the Trump administration can expect a pitched battle from progressive Senate Democrats dedicated to remaking the American economy in the   high unemployment model of continental Europe. After losing the presidential election, muffing the opportunity to capture the Senate, and managing to hold only 16 state governorships â€”  not to mention their minority standing in the House and most state legislatures â€”  we likely wonâ€™t be hearing Obama pontificating on the sidelines that elections have consequences. Instead, we can expect the only remaining consequential Democrats â€”  those who can filibuster against the popular will in the Senate â€”  to rely on the 60 vote rule to try to run out the clock until the 2020 presidential elections. In the end, Republicans in congress may have to resort to a grand budget reconciliation bill â€”  or for their senators to reluctantly vote to suspend the 60 vote rule â€”  to push through a panoply of reforms, and Trump will have to marshal public support for radical measures to overcome a barrage of criticism and protests from liberal politicians and the media. Bigger than his vision and knack for picking competent executives will be his salesmanship.

Dawson has reduced his permanent crew of workers from dozens in the 1970s to about nine today\n\nThe rows of low-slung plants under the hot Georgia sun are deceptive: Itâ€™s what grows underground that counts.\n\nâ€œI love this dirt more than anything â€“ except my son,â€ says farmhand Franklin â€œSpankyâ€ Laidler, jumping off his red tractor onto a field where peanuts burrow in the ground.\n\nFor many, that love of this sandy Southern soil is more than just a way of life, itâ€™s a wealth generator. Mr. Laidler says he works so much that if he was paid hourly instead of salaried, â€œIâ€™d be a millionaire.â€ Instead, itâ€™s his boss who has grown wealthy on these 9,000 acres. â€œHe could quit farming now and heâ€™d have nothing to worry about.â€\n\nA different harvest takes place at the Pulaski County dump, just outside Hawkinsville. At night, men with headlamps, like monster fireflies, pick through the dayâ€™s detritus looking for valuable scraps to sell.\n\nThese are two pictures of income inequality in rural America.\n\nThe widening gulf between the haves and have nots is not limited to the Rust Beltâ€™s cast-off manufacturing workers, working class suburbanites, or inner-city poor working on a stagnant minimum wage. The same trends have taken hold in farm country, though in different forms. The farms that once generated wealth for entire communities are now creating a new class of superfarmers.\n\nThe trend is not unprecedented. When the South was more agrarian, the divide was worse â€“ land ownership was the ultimate â€œunequalizer.â€\n\nBut after a period of more equal wealth, the trend is clearly back toward greater inequality, with more money in the hands of the few. Automation has made farm jobs disappear, and at the bottom of the income ladder, many rural residents are still struggling to recover from the Great Recession.\n\nFor places like Hawkinsville, these trends represent a deepening challenge for how to sow hope. And yet, rural America retains some advantages for addressing those broken hopes. It begins, experts say, with a willingness to reject the tendency toward insularity and open arms and minds to new ideas.\n\nâ€œCommunities that are waiting for either [Donald] Trump or [Hillary] Clinton to come into office and solve all their issues are being unrealistic,â€ says David Peters, a rural sociologist who studies heartland inequality at Iowa State University in Ames. â€œResidents and community leaders do, however, have this power to build up trust in the community â€¦ [in order] to marshal investment and resources. Yes, itâ€™s difficult. But itâ€™s within their power to change.â€\n\nThe most striking thing about rural America's inequality is what you don't see. Wealth is not marked by gated communities or mansions. Fashion plates do not strut along Commerce Street in downtown Hawkinsville. Indeed, thereâ€™s a ramshackle air to the place, broken only occasionally by the one sign of ostentation: brand-new Ford F-350s growling down the highways.\n\nYet wealth has been growing here until recently â€“ in part because of a short-term turn in the farming cycle; in part, because of long-term consolidation.\n\nA run of high prices in the aftermath of the Great Recession meant farmers like Gary Dawson were able to slash their debts and pay cash for tractors and more land. He could expand because bigger machinery and improved soil-conditioning techniques allowed him to farm more land more efficiently.\n\nâ€œWe started with a four-row harvester and now weâ€™re running a 12-row one,â€ he says.\n\nThe farming cycle is now turning against farmers. Net cash farm income is expected to fall for the fourth year in a row this year. Midwestern farmland prices have fallen sharply from record highs. Nevertheless, by expanding and becoming more efficient, Mr. Dawson is joining the ranks of superfarmers â€“ a longterm trend that is putting farm production and wealth into fewer and fewer hands.\n\nThe level of concentration varies by crop and by region.\n\nA quarter-century ago, the South's big cotton farmers (with at least 1,000 acres planted) were already producing 30 percent of the nation's crop; by 2007, it was half, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Midwestern corn and soybean farmers â€“ once the backbone of a rural middle class â€“ are moving in the same direction. By 2007, big farmers produced nearly a third of the corn crop (up from 9 percent in 1992).\n\nâ€œWhat most people think of as family farms donâ€™t exist in large numbers anymore, but what exists are large family businesses â€¦ in the $3 to $5 million range,â€ says Mr. Peters, the Iowa State sociologist.\n\nAnd the bigger the farm, the bigger its average profit margin. By 2011, as crop prices were rising, the average midsize family farm was worth $2.6 million and earned $156,000 a year â€“ two-thirds of that from farming. Large family farms were worth $4.8 million and earning $413,000; very large farms, just under $10 million and earning $1.7 million.\n\nAs this wealth accumulates, it is being spread to fewer and fewer people. The midsize to very large operations represent less than 8 percent of the 2.1 million farm households in the United States, most of which rely on income outside agriculture for their livelihood. And as the big operations become more mechanized and efficient, they're not hiring droves of new farmhands. Mr. Dawson has reduced his permanent crew from dozens in the 1970s to about nine today.\n\nâ€œA typical [large] farmer is not going to admit that theyâ€™re making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, in part because nowadays â€¦ those who have traditionally performed jobs on the farm are left out of any sort of share in the wealth thatâ€™s being produced,â€ says Jonathan Bryant, a history professor at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, who studies small-town life in the South. â€œThatâ€™s become a difficult situation for a lot of folks, and many just leave. Those that donâ€™t are the people you see in those clustered groups of rotting trailer houses: Theyâ€™re stuck as much as some person in a Central American country is stuck.â€\n\nIn Hawkinsville, over half of its high school graduates leave for college or someplace else every year and donâ€™t come back. Despite his success in farming, Dawson's children have gone on to professional work elsewhere. His daughter is an architect; his son works at Robins Air Force Base, just up the road, as a software technician.\n\nFor those who havenâ€™t shared in the farm boom, the disparity looks exactly like despair.\n\nCount Rex Milner and his wife, Leeanne, among them. As a just-weaned kitten attacks a rock in their front yard, they describe what seems a far cry from a rural paradise in middle Georgia. Yes, they can float down the lazy Ocmulgee River in inner tubes â€“ the local go-to entertainment. But as with hundreds here, the Milners rely not on a paycheck but on a federal disability check, which they pad with what amounts to a permanent yard sale. â€œYouâ€™ve got to scrounge for every dollar you get,â€ says Mr. Milner, a junk dealer who combs the countryside and flea markets for items he can mark up and sell. â€œItâ€™s never been this bad, the economy.â€\n\nTheyâ€™d love to move to another place and start over. But cash-poor and burdened with high-interest debt, he says, â€œWeâ€™re stuck.\"\n\nFor the most part, locals like the Milners donâ€™t blame big farmers. After all, itâ€™s hard to criticize those whose hard work has been bolstered by good fortune, even though they may have been born into a land-rich family. Instead, itâ€™s Hillary Clinton or President Obama who are the main targets of bitter complaints.\n\n\"Inequality works both ways: Itâ€™s not just concentration of wealth, but itâ€™s also what happens at the bottom,â€ says Peters, the rural sociologist. â€œThe upshot is that the trend of the withering middle class has occurred in rural areas much further and quicker than in urban and metro communities in general.â€\n\nThe current rural inequality is not unheard of, at least in the South.\n\nâ€œWe have seen this kind of inequality before, and itâ€™s when we were highly agriculturally dependent in the nation,â€ says Linda Lobao, a rural sociologist at Ohio State University in Columbus.Â â€œItâ€™s always the case with land in rural communities: land makes power. And power often doesnâ€™t want change.\"\n\nFarmers in the 1970s also saw several good years back-to-back and bid up land prices, only to see the farm economy collapse in the 1980s. When land prices crashed, many indebted operators lost their farms Another price downturn could happen, squeezing farm incomes again. Net cash income is projected to fall by a third this year versus the 2012 peak. And land prices have already begun to ease downward.\n\nHawkinsville is not thriving: A restaurant featuring â€œbest burgers in townâ€ is not open at the supper hour. Town fathers have been working for 30 years to renovate an old opera house, But it's still not done. An old firehouse shows cracks in its foundation, waiting, year after year, for renovation.\n\nSociologists say reforms may have to run deeper than opera house grants for many divided farm towns grappling for survival in the new economy.\n\nAccording to Peters and Professor Lobao, rural communities that have managed to thrive despite the dour employment dynamics exhibit similar values: an openness to change and outsiders. In many parts of the country, rural towns that have welcomed immigrants, especially, have seen their downtowns, if not thrive, at least manage a slower population decline than more insular communities.\n\nLast year, the White House Rural Council launched Rural Impact, which is helping 10 rural and tribal communities fight income inequality primarily by giving children more educational options. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack calls it a â€œwhole-family framework for addressing child poverty.â€\n\nMore broadly, â€œthe key is to try to organize people in some manner to put more claims on local government, to gain more political power,â€ says Lobao. In many income-divided towns, she adds, thereâ€™s a sense that those who donâ€™t farm are â€œsubject to forces that are beyond their control, which leads to a more fatalistic approach.â€\n\nBut in a recent survey of 99 struggling farm towns, adds Peters, â€œwe find that communities that have higher levels of social capital â€“ the level to which people trust one another, and whether theyâ€™re tolerant of different opinions and allow newcomers to be involved in decisionmaking and power structures â€“ those tend to have better economic and demographic outcomes.â€\n\n[Editor's note: The cutline for the photo of Franklin 'Spanky' Laidler has been corrected to correspond with his quote in the story.]", "output": "1.

Somerville, a Harvard neuroscientist, sometimes finds herself in front of an audience of judges. They come to hear her speak about how the brain develops. Itâ€™s a subject on which many legal questions depend. How old does someone have to be to be sentenced to death? When should someone get to vote? Can an    give informed consent? Scientists like Dr. Somerville have learned a great deal in recent years. But the complex picture thatâ€™s emerging lacks the bright lines that policy makers would like. â€œOftentimes, the very first question I get at the end of a presentation is, â€˜O. K. thatâ€™s all very nice, but when is the brain finished? When is it done developing? â€™â€ Dr. Somerville said. â€œAnd I give a very nonsatisfying answer. â€ Dr. Somerville laid out the conundrum in detail in a commentary published on Wednesday in the journal Neuron. The human brain reaches its adult volume by age 10, but the neurons that make it up continue to change for years after that. The connections between neighboring neurons get pruned back, as new links emerge between more widely separated areas of the brain. Eventually this reshaping slows, a sign that the brain is maturing. But it happens at different rates in different parts of the brain. The pruning in the occipital lobe, at the back of the brain, tapers off by age 20. In the frontal lobe, in the front of the brain, new links are still forming at age 30, if not beyond. â€œIt challenges the notion of what â€˜doneâ€™ really means,â€ Dr. Somerville said. As the anatomy of the brain changes, its activity changes as well. In a childâ€™s brain, neighboring regions tend to work together. By adulthood, distant regions start acting in concert. Neuroscientists have speculated that this   harmony lets the adult brain work more efficiently and process more information. But the development of these networks is still mysterious, and itâ€™s not yet clear how they influence behavior. Some children, researchers have found, have neural networks that look as if they belong to an adult. But theyâ€™re still just children. Dr. Somervilleâ€™s own research focuses on how the changes in the maturing brain affect how people think. Adolescents do about as well as adults on cognition tests, for instance. But if theyâ€™re feeling strong emotions, those scores can plummet. The problem seems to be that teenagers have not yet developed a strong brain system that keeps emotions under control. That system may take a surprisingly long time to mature, according to a study published this year in Psychological Science. The authors asked a group of   to    to lie in an fMRI scanner and look at a monitor. They were instructed to press a button each time they were shown faces with a certain expression on them  â€”   happy in some trials, scared or neutral in others. And in some cases, the participants knew that they might hear a loud, jarring noise at the end of the trial. In the trials without the noise, the subjects did just as well as people in their  . But when they were expecting the noise, they did worse on the test. Brain scans revealed that the regions of their brains in which emotion is processed were unusually active, while areas dedicated to keeping those emotions under control were weak. â€œThe young adults looked like teenagers,â€ said Laurence Steinberg, a psychologist at Temple University and an author of the study. Dr. Steinberg agreed with Dr. Somerville that the maturing of the brain was proving to be a long, complicated process without obvious milestones. Nevertheless, he thinks recent studies hold some important lessons for policy makers. He has proposed, for example, that the voting age be lowered to 16. â€œ   are just as good at logical reasoning as older people are,â€ Dr. Steinberg said. Courts, too, may need to take into account the powerful influence of emotions, even on people in their early 20s. â€œMost crime situations that young people are involved in are emotionally arousing situations  â€”   theyâ€™re scared, or theyâ€™re angry, intoxicated or whatever,â€ Dr. Steinberg said. Dr. Somerville, on the other hand, said she was reluctant to offer specific policy suggestions based on her brain research. â€œIâ€™m still in the learning stage, so Iâ€™d hesitate to call out any particular thing,â€ she said. But she does think it is important for the scientists to get a fuller picture of how the brain matures. Researchers need to do   studies to track its development from year to year, she said, well into the 20s or beyond. Itâ€™s not enough to compare people using simple categories, such as labeling people below age 18 as children and those older as adults. â€œNothing magical occurs at that age,â€ Dr. Somerville said.", "output": "1.

Opposition lawmaker Ben Bradshaw last week urged the government to look into reports by advocacy group Open Democracy suggesting that the origin of some Brexit campaign funds was unclear. Bradshaw said in parliament the issue should be investigated  given the widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference in Western democracies . At a briefing with reporters, May s spokesman was asked if the prime minister was concerned about the reports.  I am not aware of those concerns,  he said.  More broadly, as we ve always said, the UK democratic system is amongst one of the most secure in the world and will continue to be so.  Open Democracy, which describes itself as an independent media platform aiming to challenge power and encourage debate, had raised questions about the finances of businessman Arron Banks, one of the main financial backers of the Brexit cause.  The only people concerned are those that still can t come to terms with the fact that they lost the referendum so will come up with more and more ludicrous excuses,  Banks said in a statement texted to Reuters by a spokesman. Banks dismissed Open Democracy s report without addressing it in detail and accused Bradshaw of peddling a  tedious myth  about Russian meddling in the Brexit debate. The Electoral Commission, which regulates political finance in Britain, said in April it was investigating campaign spending by Leave.EU, one of the pro-Brexit organizations funded by Banks. It gave no details of what its probe was about.  I m not remotely worried. We did nothing wrong,  Banks said in the text. A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said the investigation was still going on and it would not provide any further information until it was complete. Open Democracy had also raised concerns about a large donation to Northern Ireland s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is now propping up May s minority Conservative government. Open Democracy said the origin of the money, which was spent on campaigning for Brexit, was unclear.  The DUP, which was earlier reported to have said the funds came from  an organization in England that wants to see the union (between the UK s constituent parts) kept , did not respond to repeated requests for comment. During a debate in parliament later on Monday, May was asked whether EU leaders had discussed the issue of Russian interference at a summit last week. She said it had not come up.", "output": "1.

Obamaâ€™s remarks in Elkhart, Indiana, foreshadowed the arguments he is likely to make on the campaign trail this fall against the likely Republican presidential nominee. Obama did not mention Trump by name, but he lambasted the billionaireâ€™s policy proposals, particularly his promise to dismantle most of the U.S. Dodd-Frank financial regulations. â€œHow it is that somebody would propose that we weaken regulations on Wall Street? Have we really forgotten what just happened eight years ago?â€ Obama said, sounding exasperated. â€œThe notion that you would vote for anybody who would now allow them to go back to doing the same stuff that almost broke our economyâ€™s back makes no sense. I donâ€™t care whether you are a Republican, or a Democrat or an independent, why would you do that?â€ Obama, who leaves office in January, is eager to have a Democrat succeed him to ensure his legacy on the economy, healthcare reform and climate change continues. By going to Elkhart, the president sought to illustrate the success of his policies in the face of Republican opposition. His trip to the city in early 2009 came in the middle of a fight for the U.S. Congress to pass a roughly $800 billion economic stimulus package. Elkhart had an unemployment rate as high as 19.6 percent in 2009, the White House said; it is now around 4 percent.  Indianaâ€™s Republican Governor Mike Pence said the city had recovered despite Obamaâ€™s policies, not because of them. â€œI believe the people of Elkhart ... have brought our economy back in spite of the burdens that higher taxes, mandates and increasing regulations from Washington, D.C. have placed on them,â€ he wrote in an opinion piece published in â€œThe Elkhart Truth.â€ Obama has not endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her race for the Democratic presidential nomination against Bernie Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, but he has made his eagerness to campaign for the winner clear. He name checked Clintonâ€™s husband, former President Bill Clinton, by noting deficits had fallen under both of their administrations, and he said Republicans had helped the rich by blaming poor people, minorities, feminists, and immigrants for squeezing the economic wellbeing of the middle class. â€œThe primary story that Republicans have been telling about  the economy is not supported by the facts.

But British Prime Minister Theresa May s room to offer additional concessions to Dublin appeared extremely limited as the Northern Ireland party propping up her government hinted it might withdraw its support if she gives too much.  Avoiding a so-called  hard border  on the island of Ireland is the last major hurdle before Brexit talks can move to negotiations on Britain s future trade relationship with the EU and a possible two-year Brexit transition deal. A mis-step by May could bring down the British government or spook British businesses fearful of a cliff-edge Brexit without a transition deal.  We are looking for significantly more clarity than we currently have from the British negotiating team,  Coveney told parliament in Dublin, adding that  constructive ambiguity  from Britain would not suffice.  Hopefully we will make progress that will allow us to move on to Phase 2 in the middle of December,  he said.  If it is not possible to do that, so be it.  Britain in the coming days needs to demonstrate  sufficient progress  on three key EU conditions   a financial settlement, rights of expatriate citizens and the Irish border   for leaders to give a green light to trade talks at a summit on Dec. 14-15. With significant progress on the financial settlement and citizen rights, a deal on the Irish border would pave the way for Brussels to offer British Prime Minister Theresa May a transition deal as early as January. Britain s Times newspaper, without citing a source, said London was close to a deal after a proposal to devolve more powers to the government of its province of Northern Ireland so that it could ensure regulations there did not diverge from the EU rules in place south of the border across the island. The border between EU-member Ireland and the British region of Northern Ireland will be the UK s only land frontier with the bloc after Brexit, and Dublin fears a hard border could disrupt 20 years of delicate peace in Northern Ireland.  Ireland has called on Britain to provide details of how it will ensure there is no  regulatory divergence  after Brexit in March 2019 that would require physical border infrastructure. But any attempt at a solution will have to convince Northern Ireland s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 members of parliament are propping up May s government. The party ratcheted up the pressure on Thursday by suggesting it might withdraw its support for May s government.

May will then hold talks in Brussels on Monday with EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker and his chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and will hope to secure a green light to trade talks at a summit on Dec. 14-15. Barnier said on Wednesday the summit would be able to discuss a transition period and that the EU would define a  framework  next year of the  new partnership  with Britain that would follow the transition.

Anti-immigration politicians have leapt on the crimes to ram home their message that the center-left government has been lax on border controls, allowing more than 600,000 migrants, mainly Africans, to enter the country over the past four years.  There are too many of them. I will send quite a few home,  Matteo Salvini, the head of the rightist Northern League, wrote on Twitter this week after police said a Bangladeshi man had been arrested in Rome on suspicion of raping a Finnish au pair. The Rome case came two weeks after a young Polish tourist said she was gang raped by four Africans, three of them aged under 18, on a beach in the Adriatic resort of Rimini. The woman s partner was badly beaten by the youths and a Peruvian transsexual said she was raped and assaulted by the same quartet later the same night. The leader of the gang was named as a Congolese asylum-seeker who had been allowed to stay in Italy on humanitarian grounds. The other three were Moroccan brothers aged 15 and 17, who were born in Italy, and a 16-year-old Nigerian.  A gang of Maghreb worms,  said Georgia Meloni, head of the rightist Brothers of Italy party, which is expected to be allied with the Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party at the election. An opinion poll in la Repubblica newspaper on Wednesday showed 46 percent of Italians thought migrants represented a threat to their personal safety and to public order against 40 percent in the last such survey in February. Five years ago the figure stood at just 26 percent. Opposition parties say the government cannot ignore the issue, pointing to official data showing that in the first seven months of the year 1,534 Italians were arrested or accused of rape compared with 904 foreigners suspected of the same crime.  Some 40 percent of rapes are being committed by foreigners who make up 8 percent of the population. You can t sweep this under a carpet,  said Deborah Bergamini, a lawmaker with Forza Italia.  The influx of migrants is having major consequences.  Though Italy was a colonial power in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries and migrants have come to Italy for decades, the country mainly served as a transit route for the rest of Europe and so remains an overwhelmingly white country. However, EU migration policy means that increasing numbers of would-be asylum seekers are having to stay to secure residency permits, meaning many more Africans and refugees from the Middle East are trying to make Italy their home. Rising public concern over the inflows is starting to affect government policy-making, with the ruling center-left Democratic Party on Tuesday freezing a long-promised bill that would have granted citizenship to the children of immigrants. Some 70 percent of Italians backed the measure earlier this year, but support has now plummeted to just 52 percent, according to the la Repubblica survey. Interior Minister Marco Minniti has also intervened to stem the flow of migrants.  I feared for democracy in this country,  Minniti said last month, explaining why, after months of a de-facto, open-door policy, the government finally introduced measures aimed at preventing people from leaving Libya for Italy. Over the past 2-1/2 months, the number of migrants reaching Italy has fallen 70 percent from the same period a year ago to some 16,500, but the rape cases have ensured that media headlines have remained highly negative about the newcomers.     German media were accused last year of initially ignoring allegations of sex assaults by migrants at New Year festivities in Cologne in order not to fuel anti-foreigner sentiment. The Italian media has no such hesitancy.  First poverty, now they bring us disease,  a front page headline in Libero daily said this month when an Italian child died of malaria just days after she had shared a hospital ward with two African children suffering the same illness. Malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes and cannot be passed person-to-person. It was eradicated from Italy in 1970 and doctors do not know how the girl, who had never been abroad, caught the disease. Cecile Kashetu Kyenge, a Congolese-born European parliamentarian with the ruling Democratic Party, says those sorts of headlines show how racism is on the rise.  The newspapers turn migrants into the enemies of Italy and people start to believe this nonsense,  said Kyenge, a former minister who receives regular racist abuse on social media.  Racism is used as a political weapon and the situation is getting worse. The problem is we are living in a perpetual election campaign and politicians play on peoples  fears.  The Northern League has led the anti-migrant charge with its leader, Salvini, regularly denouncing migrants on Facebook. The party has been rewarded by a jump in support from 6 percent in 2014 to more than 15 percent today, making it the third largest political force in Italy in many opinion polls.  The rise of the Northern League can be put down to the party s anti-migrant stance and Salvini s undoubted ability to play the populist card,  said pollster Renato Mannheimer. He predicted that the issue would continue to predominate.  The economy is a much more important issue, but sadly I think it will take a back seat to immigration in the coming election campaign,  he said.", "output": "1. True"}

However, Slim, who spoke out against his fellow billionaire during the U.S. election campaign but had dinner with him after the Nov. 8 victory at the polls, said Trumpâ€™s policies aimed at growing the U.S. economy would boost Mexicoâ€™s growth as well as provide jobs for Mexican laborers living north of the border.     â€œThe circumstances in the United States are very favorable for Mexico,â€ Slim said, adding that he has not had any communication with Trumpâ€™s team since the December dinner. â€œIt wasnâ€™t a romance,â€ he joked about the meeting. Referring repeatedly to Trumpâ€™s books and other writings, Slim argued that people should not be surprised at Trumpâ€™s actions because it is all in his book â€œGreat Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America,â€ which Slim said he had not finished reading. â€œHeâ€™s a great negotiator,â€ Slim said. He said businesses should not be too worried if Trumpâ€™s policies led to the collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) underpinning Mexicoâ€™s economy, saying the country could fall back on World Trade Organization tariffs. He said Mexican workers in the United States would benefit from Trumpâ€™s planned infrastructure push, but warned that U.S. protectionism and other policies could hurt American consumers.  â€œAmong these changes is a return to the past, what a dear friend called â€˜regressive utopiasâ€™,â€ he said, calling on the United States to focus on advanced manufacturing. Asked about Trumpâ€™s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Slim said the best barrier to illegal immigration would be investment that created opportunities and jobs in Mexico. Before the highly-anticipated news conference, speculation had been growing about whether Slim might try to run for president in 2018, but he poured cold water on that talk. â€œI think I can do more on the business side,â€ he said. Slimâ€™s largest companies do not have much obvious exposure to any border tax Trump might impose on Mexican imports. His high-profile holding in the New York Times Co, made him a target during the U.S. campaign, when Trump accused him of using the newspaper to try to help Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton. Slimâ€™s shares have limited voting rights. Slim on Friday said he had been selling New York Times stock, but his son-in-law later said this was not correct. At the conference he was flanked by two of his sons, Carlos and Marco Antonio, and his son-in-law, Arturo Elias, with other family members watching. Most of the Slim familyâ€™s wealth comes from Latin America-focused telecoms giant America Movil. America Movil does have a substantial U.S. business called TracFone which sells prepaid phone plans to customers and rents the networks of big operators. His next largest companies are retail and industrial conglomerate Grupo Carso and Mexico-focused bank Grupo Financiero Inbursa.", "output": "1. True"}

The Volokh Conspiracy, not to be outdone, has 10Â posts up on the topic. With apologies to all of them, their takeawayÂ message is:\n\nI donâ€™t disagree with a single thing that Mike Bailey wrote at The Monkey Cage or that SCOTUSblogâ€™s Tom Goldstein wrote about how to game out the strategies of both Obama and RepublicanÂ senators. It all makes sense. Itâ€™s all very savvy and very political.\n\n[Supreme Court nomination process sure to be an epic debate]\n\nReading through them, however, there was just one small, teeny, tiny detail that kept nagging at me: No matter how this plays out, the Supreme Court loses.\n\nThe hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts has been banging on periodically about the erosion of trust in American political institutions. The Supreme Court has not been immune to that trend. Hereâ€™s the General Social Survey data:\n\nTo be fair, the Supreme Court is still more widely respected than either Congress or President Obama. But if you think about it, thatâ€™s a really low bar.\n\nThe sources of this decline are likely myriad, but a big part of it is that the court is increasingly viewed through a partisan lens, and no partisan has liked the Roberts court in recent years. Indeed, the combination of divided government and political polarization forced the Supreme Court into a more overtly political role, thereby guaranteeing it would serve as a wedge issue going forward. DemocratsÂ didnâ€™t love this court because Republicans appointed a majority of the justices, leading to rulings like Citizens United and Heller. Republicans didnâ€™t love this court because its rulings on gay marriage and Obamacare shifting the political status quo to the left.\n\nWeâ€™re at the point in this country where partisanship is now the last socially approved form of discrimination. As Paul Waldman noted over at The Plum Line, the trend on Senate confirmation votes of Supreme Court justices sustains this point:\n\n[Clarence Thomas excepted], through the Clinton administration, justices got near-unanimous votes. Then things changed starting with the George W. Bush administration. While Democrats did their best to find some dirt on John Roberts and Samuel Alito and Republicans did the same to Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, none of it amounted to much of anything. Yet in all those cases, most of the opposition party voted against the nominee. And itâ€™s likely to get even worse.\n\nThe GOP Senate caucusâ€™sÂ immediate reaction to Scaliaâ€™s passing is simply the latest iteration of this dynamic.\n\nWhether due merely to partisan sorting or true ideological polarization, the erosion of trust in the Supreme CourtÂ reflects decades-long trends, so the flapdoodles and argle-bargle of the past few days were probably inevitable.\n\nBut as Dara Lind noted over at Vox, itâ€™s a shame that political leaders havenâ€™t focused a wee bit more on one of Scaliaâ€™s more gracious attributes. Scalia was clearly able to separate the political from the personal. His close friendship with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Ralph to his Sam, attests to that. As Lind concludes:\n\nI get why this seat is such a high-stakes political battle for everyone involved. Politics ainâ€™t beanbag. But the battle that is about to ensue over Scaliaâ€™s seat is going to be nasty. Itâ€™s part of a secular trend that will only furtherÂ the erosion of public trust in the Supreme Court.

I canâ€™t resist saying hello, requesting a   and wishing them a fun time. I leave the Y grinning from ear to ear, uplifted not just by my own workout but even more so by my interaction with these darling representatives of the next generation. What a great way to start the day! When I told a fellow swimmer about this experience and mentioned that I was writing a column on the health benefits of positive emotions, she asked, â€œWhat do you do about people who are always negative?â€ She was referring to her parents, whose chronic negativity seems to drag everyone down and make family visits extremely unpleasant. I lived for half a century with a man who suffered from periodic bouts of depression, so I understand how challenging negativism can be. I wish I had known years ago about the work Barbara Fredrickson, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina, has done on fostering positive emotions, in particular her theory that accumulating â€œ  of positivity,â€ like my daily interaction with children, can, over time, result in greater overall  . The research that Dr. Fredrickson and others have done demonstrates that the extent to which we can generate positive emotions from even everyday activities can determine who flourishes and who doesnâ€™t. More than a sudden bonanza of good fortune, repeated brief moments of positive feelings can provide a buffer against stress and depression and foster both physical and mental health, their studies show. This is not to say that one must always be positive to be healthy and happy. Clearly, there are times and situations that naturally result in negative feelings in the most upbeat of individuals. Worry, sadness, anger and other such â€œdownersâ€ have their place in any normal life. But chronically viewing the glass as   is detrimental both mentally and physically and inhibits oneâ€™s ability to bounce back from lifeâ€™s inevitable stresses. Negative feelings activate a region of the brain called the amygdala, which is involved in processing fear and anxiety and other emotions. Dr. Richard J. Davidson, a neuroscientist and founder of the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin  â€”   Madison, has shown that people in whom the amygdala recovers slowly from a threat are at greater risk for a variety of health problems than those in whom it recovers quickly. Both he and Dr. Fredrickson and their colleagues have demonstrated that the brain is â€œplastic,â€ or capable of generating new cells and pathways, and it is possible to train the circuitry in the brain to promote more positive responses. That is, a person can learn to be more positive by practicing certain skills that foster positivity. For example, Dr. Fredricksonâ€™s team found that six weeks of training in a form of meditation focused on compassion and kindness resulted in an increase in positive emotions and social connectedness and improved function of one of the main nerves that helps to control heart rate. The result is a more variable heart rate that, she said in an interview, is associated with objective health benefits like better control of blood glucose, less inflammation and faster recovery from a heart attack. Dr. Davidsonâ€™s team showed that as little as two weeksâ€™ training in compassion and kindness meditation generated changes in brain circuitry linked to an increase in positive social behaviors like generosity. â€œThe results suggest that taking time to learn the skills to   positive emotions can help us become healthier, more social, more resilient versions of ourselves,â€ Dr. Fredrickson reported in the National Institutes of Health monthly newsletter in 2015. In other words, Dr. Davidson said, â€œ  can be considered a life skill. If you practice, you can actually get better at it. â€ By learning and regularly practicing skills that promote positive emotions, you can become a happier and healthier person. Thus, there is hope for people like my friendâ€™s parents should they choose to take steps to develop and reinforce positivity. In her newest book, â€œLove 2. 0,â€ Dr. Fredrickson reports that â€œshared positivity  â€”   having two people caught up in the same emotion  â€”   may have even a greater impact on health than something positive experienced by oneself. â€ Consider watching a funny play or movie or TV show with a friend of similar tastes, or sharing good news, a joke or amusing incidents with others. Dr. Fredrickson also teaches â€œ  meditationâ€ focused on directing   wishes to others. This can result in people â€œfeeling more in tune with other people at the end of the day,â€ she said. Activities Dr. Fredrickson and others endorse to foster positive emotions include: Do good things for other people. In addition to making others happier, this enhances your own positive feelings. It can be something as simple as helping someone carry heavy packages or providing directions for a stranger. Appreciate the world around you. It could be a bird, a tree, a beautiful sunrise or sunset or even an article of clothing someone is wearing. I met a man recently who was reveling in the architectural details of the   houses in my neighborhood. Develop and bolster relationships. Building strong social connections with friends or family members enhances feelings of   and,   studies have shown, is associated with better health and a longer life. Establish goals that can be accomplished. Perhaps you want to improve your tennis or read more books. But be realistic a goal that is impractical or too challenging can create unnecessary stress. Learn something new. It can be a sport, a language, an instrument or a game that instills a sense of achievement,   and resilience. But here, too, be realistic about how long this may take and be sure you have the time needed. Choose to accept yourself, flaws and all. Rather than imperfections and failures, focus on your positive attributes and achievements. The loveliest people I know have none of the external features of loveliness but shine with the internal beauty of caring, compassion and consideration of others. Practice resilience. Rather than let loss, stress, failure or trauma overwhelm you, use them as learning experiences and steppingstones to a better future. Remember the expression: When life hands you a lemon, make lemonade. Practice mindfulness. Ruminating on past problems or future difficulties drains mental resources and steals attention from current pleasures. Let go of things you canâ€™t control and focus on the   .

The decision, however, does not settle the issue of gay rights and religious liberty.\n\nWhy climate scientists are taking fact-checking into their own hands\n\nA man holds a US and a rainbow flag outside the Supreme Court in Washington after the court legalized gay marriage nationwide on June 26. After the decision, religious conservatives are focusing on preserving their right to object. Their concerns are for the thousands of faith-based charities, colleges, and hospitals that want to hire, fire, serve, and set policy according to their religious beliefs.\n\nTwo blockbuster cases dominated the docket at the United States Supreme Court in its recently-concluded term â€“ one stands as a civil rights landmark, the other is slipping into quiet obscurity.\n\nIn its 2014-15 term, the high court decided 74 cases, including rulings upholding the presidentâ€™s power to determine US policy over the contested status of Jerusalem, permitting Texas to exclude the confederate flag from specialty license plates, and barring prosecutors from treating an undersized grouper as the legal equivalent of a shredded document.\n\nBut by far the termâ€™s biggest decisions came in the courtâ€™s historic ruling for same-sex marriage and in a 6-to-3 vote upholding distribution of tax credits in President Obamaâ€™s health care reform law.\n\nWhile the same-sex marriage decision will reverberate for years, the high courtâ€™s ruling in the Obamacare case has quickly fallen off the national radar now that the once-dire threat to millions of health insurance policies has subsided.\n\nIn contrast, Justice Anthony Kennedyâ€™s decision in the same-sex marriage case is a transformative event. It marks the most significant civil rights decision by the high court in at least a generation â€“ a kind of gay rights version of Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nIn his decision, Justice Kennedy established that the fundamental right to marry embraces all Americans â€“ regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nIn the 5-to-4 ruling, the high court said that state bans on same-sex marriage violate due process and equal protection rights of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe decision effectively ends a rancorous state-by-state debate over marriage, and extends a welcoming hand to a segment of American society that has faced open hostility and discrimination.\n\nAs such, the marriage decision represents a huge victory for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, their friends, families, and other supporters.\n\nâ€œThis decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free,â€ President Obama said in comments shortly after the ruling.\n\nBut the case that sharply divided the court itself has also left the country sharply divided. Religious conservatives feel they are under siege and are looking for ways to fight back or protect themselves.\n\nRecognizing this, Kennedyâ€™s decision hints at matters beyond gay marriage and anticipates the next big high court showdown â€“ a bitter national struggle pitting gay rights against religious liberty.\n\nAnalysts say Kennedy went out of his way in his decision to avoid labeling religious conservatives as bigots or motivated by animosity toward homosexuals. That posture is critical, they say, because it leaves open a way for the court in future cases to balance the competing interests of religious conservatives with the growing rights and clout of gay Americans.\n\nâ€œKennedy, I think, wants to keep the courtâ€™s options open to respect religious and traditional marriage libertarian rights to exclude or to discriminate,â€ Yale Law Professor William Eskridge told a recent gathering of the American Constitution Society.\n\nâ€œJustice Kennedy is loath to close off those options,â€ he said.\n\nProfessor Eskridge noted that Kennedy provided the decisive fifth vote in a 2000 high court case that upheld the Boy Scoutsâ€™ right to bar gay men from serving as scoutmasters. To the Boy Scouts, the decision affirmed their right to associate with like-minded individuals. To the rejected scoutmaster, the decision endorsed blatant anti-gay discrimination.\n\nWashington Appellate Lawyer Gene Schaerr said in a Heritage Foundation briefing that Justice Kennedy went â€œout of his way in numerous places in his opinion to try to suggest respect for the religious viewpoint on this issue.â€\n\nâ€œThose of us who care about religious liberty can be grateful that Justice Kennedyâ€™s opinion dodged some big bullets,â€ Mr. Schaerr said. â€œBut the opinion, unintentionally I think, launched a number of grenades that are still in the air.â€\n\nHe noted that some religious organizations may soon face loss of their tax exempt status unless they jettison their opposition to same-sex marriage, and religious colleges may discover their accreditation is in jeopardy if they are found to discriminate against same-sex married couples in violation of constitutional rights.\n\nIn contrast to the historic same-sex marriage landmark with its ongoing repercussions, the high court challenge to President Obamaâ€™s health care reform law is fast on its way to being forgotten.\n\nHad a majority of justices agreed with the plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act barred the distribution of tax credits thorough federal health care exchanges set up in 34 states, that decision would have gutted the ACA and left millions of Americans unable to afford any health insurance.\n\nBut thatâ€™s not what happened.\n\nInstead, the court essentially gave the Obama administration the benefit of the doubt over what the majority justices said were â€œa few examples of inartful drafting.â€\n\nWriting for the majority in the 6-to-3 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts said it would make no sense for Congress to create a law meant to advance universal health care by allowing tax subsidies only in health care exchanges established by a state â€“ rather than also in exchanges set up by the federal government.\n\nâ€œCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,â€ Chief Justice Roberts wrote.\n\nIt marked the second time the chief justice had joined the high courtâ€™s liberal wing to save the ACA from its potential demise at the nationâ€™s highest court. In June 2012, Roberts joined with the courtâ€™s liberal wing to uphold the controversial measure after concluding that the lawâ€™s mandated insurance requirement amounted to a tax rather than a penalty.\n\nThe chief justiceâ€™s twin rescue operations prompted Justice Antonin Scalia to quip in a dissenting opinion that rather than calling the law Obamacare, it should be renamed SCOTUScare. Â (SCOTUS is an acronym for Supreme Court of the United States.)\n\nBeyond the two blockbusters, the courtâ€™s term produced several other notable decisions.\n\nIn an 8-to-1 decision, the court put employers on notice that they must recognize the need to accommodate religious practices of their workers or job applicants, even when a job applicant fails to request an accommodation.\n\nIn that case the court ruled for a Muslim teen who was rejected for a job at an Abercrombie Kids store because she wore a headscarf.\n\nIn its 10th year under Chief Justice Roberts, the court remains essentially a conservative body. But you wouldnâ€™t know it from this yearâ€™s highest profile cases. Of the top 10 decisions of the term, analysts classify eight as liberal victories. Only two of the top 10 decisions are said to embrace a conservative approach.\n\nThis pendulum-like movement at the court between liberal and conservative rulings is due in large part to Justice Kennedyâ€™s position at or near the center of the nine-member court.\n\nHe is, thus, frequently positioned to cast the fifth and deciding vote in controversial cases.\n\nThe chief justice has also occasionally swung over to join the liberal wing in high profile cases, as both he and Kennedy did in the Obamacare decision.\n\nDespite that exception, Kennedyâ€™s power to singlehandedly decide major cases was on full display this term.\n\nHe provided the deciding vote in a ruling that an independent commission formed in Arizona by ballot initiative did not violate the Constitutionâ€™s \"elections clause.\"\n\nThe decision is a major victory for election reform advocates. It upholds similar commissions in six other states and gives a green light to others looking for ways to reduce the involvement of partisan politics in drawing election districts.\n\nKennedy also swung over to join his liberal colleagues in a redistricting case in Alabama. In that case the court agreed to keep alive a challenge to a voting map drawn by the Republican-controlled state legislature. Minority groups charged the map illegally undercut black voting clout in the state.\n\nKennedy also played a key role in holding off an effort by the courtâ€™s conservatives to bar the use of so-called disparate impact discrimination claims under the Fair Housing Act.\n\nThe case marked the third time in recent years that the courtâ€™s conservatives had sought to take up a case to strike down the disparate impact approach under the FHA.\n\nThe disparate impact theory of discrimination permits lawsuits when a statistical analysis shows that minorities suffer disproportionate harm from a particular policy â€“ even when that policy is racially neutral.\n\nInstead of joining the conservatives, Kennedy sided with the liberal wing and wrote the majority opinion upholding disparate impact lawsuits under the FHA, but also seeking to impose limits on such suits when they might lead to racial quotas.\n\nApart from the string of liberal wins, the high court produced two conservative victories among the termâ€™s top cases. Both were made possible by the swing vote of Kennedy.\n\nIn one, the court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency must take the cost of compliance into account when considering whether to regulate toxic air pollutants emitted from coal- and oil-fired power plants.\n\nIn the second conservative victory, the court upheld Oklahomaâ€™s use of the drug midazolam as part of its three-drug lethal injection protocol despite the involvement of that same drug in three botched executions last year.\n\nAgain, with Kennedyâ€™s support, the court said three Oklahoma death row inmates had failed to prove that the stateâ€™s use of midazolam presented an intolerable risk that the condemned prisoners would suffer severe pain during the execution process.\n\nThe case was important because capital punishment abolitionists have been working to dry up the availability of certain drugs used in lethal injections. The ruling will make it easier for states like Oklahoma to continue to use midazolam, and to continue carry out executions.\n\nThe case is also notable because two liberal justices, Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, announced that they believe the time has come to declare the death penalty unconstitutional.\n\nThat announcement is expected to trigger a new round of litigation in death penalty cases with an eye toward bringing a dispute to the high court that might facilitate a decision striking down capital punishment throughout the US. As in most other high profile cases, the outcome in that one would likely, once again, come down to the vote of Justice Kennedy.", "output": "1. True"}

The candidate, BenoÃ®t Hamon, 49, who ran on the slogan that he would â€œmake Franceâ€™s heart beat,â€ bested Manuel Valls, the former prime minister, whose campaign has promoted more   policies and who has a strong    background. Mr. Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin, with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr. Vallsâ€™s 41 percent. â€œTonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future,â€ Mr. Hamon said, addressing his supporters. â€œOur country needs the left, but a modern, innovative left,â€ he said. Mr. Hamonâ€™s victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of President FranÃ§ois Hollande, who in December announced that he would not seek  . However, Mr. Hamonâ€™s strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that   candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election. The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7. The Socialist Party is deeply divided, and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting. About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday, in contrast with about 2. 9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left, in 2011. However, much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week, because the leading candidate, FranÃ§ois Fillon, who represents the main   party, the Republicans, was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide. While nepotism is legal in the French political system, it is not clear that she actually did any work. Prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case. Franceâ€™s electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting, but only the top two   go on to a second round. Mr. Hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left, with candidates who include   MÃ©lenchon on the far left, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent who served as economy minister in Mr. Hollandeâ€™s government and who embraces more   policies. Unless he decides to withdraw, Mr. Fillon, the mainstream right candidate, will also run, as will the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen. The two have been expected to go to the runoff. Mr. Hamonâ€™s victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people. Unlike Mr. Valls, he also clearly distanced himself from some of Mr. Hollandeâ€™s more unpopular policies, especially the economic ones. Thomas Kekenbosch, 22, a student and one of the leaders of the group the Youth With BenoÃ®t Hamon, said Mr. Hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left. â€œWe have a perspective we have something to do, to build,â€ Mr. Kekenbosch said. Mr. Hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals, such as support for workers, that many   voters believe in, according to Mr. Kekenbosch. Mr. Hollandeâ€™s government, under pressure from the European Union to meet budget restraints, struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage French businesses to expand in France. The measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes, but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving Franceâ€™s roughly 10 percent unemployment rate and its nearly 25 percent youth joblessness rate. Mr. Hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income, which would especially help young people looking for work, but would also supplement the livelihood of   French workers. The end goal would be to have everyone receive 750 euros per month (about $840). â€œWe have someone that trusts us,â€ Mr. Kekenbosch said, â€œwho says: â€˜I give you enough to pay for your studies. You can have a scholarship which spares you from working at McDonaldâ€™s on provisional contracts for 4 years. â€ Mr. Hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones. His leftist pedigree began early. His father worked at an arsenal in Brest, a city in the far west of Brittany, and his mother worked off and on as a secretary. He was an early member of the Movement of Young Socialists, and he has continued to work closely with them through his political life. He also worked for Martine Aubry, now the mayor of Lille and a former Socialist Party leader.", "output": "1. True"}

Entrenched federal bureaucrats jettisoned precepts like equal enforcement in favor of political and racialized dogmas with a zeal that risks litigation failure and invites court sanctions,â€ the letter states.

That figure was still far below the millions earned by his main Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in recent years.  Sanders and his wife, Jane, paid $27,653 in federal income taxes in 2014, an effective federal tax rate of 13.5 percent, on income of $205,271, which is their adjusted gross income before deductions. That figure is just below the $206,563 that Census data show as the lower limit for the top 5 percent of U.S. households in 2014. But Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had income approaching $140 million over the last eight years, according to previously released returns. Sanders on Thursday described himself as â€œone of the poorer members of the United States Senate.â€     Median net worth among members of the U.S. Senate in 2014 stood at $2.9 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a non-profit organization that tracks money in politics. The return released on Friday does not include information on Sandersâ€™ net worth. The return does show Sanders had federal taxable income after deductions of $140,994.  Sanders has run a populist effort, vowing to reform what he calls a â€œcorruptâ€ campaign finance system reliant on millionaires and billionaires at the expense of average voters. Clinton, in contrast, has much stronger ties to the financial system, including six-figure payments for speeches she gave to several financial institutions in recent years.  Sanders often expresses skepticism that someone with those kinds of ties can effectively overhaul banks and other institutions. Clinton says she is steadfast in her commitment to eroding income inequality and creating a safe financial system.     The two have clashed repeatedly over the topic", "output": "1. True"}

The reporters had been working on stories about a military crackdown on the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rahkine State that has caused almost 650,000 people to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. The Ministry of Information said in a statement on its Facebook page that the journalists and two policemen face charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act. The 1923 law carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. The reporters  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,  said the statement, which was accompanied by a photo of the pair in handcuffs.  It said they were detained at a police station on the outskirts of Yangon, the southeast Asian nation s main city. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo went missing on Tuesday evening after they had been invited to meet police officials over dinner. Reuters  driver Myothant Tun dropped them off at Battalion 8 s compound at around 8 pm and the two reporters and two police officers headed to a nearby restaurant. The journalists did not  return to the car. The Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh say their exodus from the mainly Buddhist nation was triggered by a military counter-offensive in Rakhine state that the United Nations has branded  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have been reporting on events of global importance in Myanmar, and we learned today that they have been arrested in connection with their work,  said Stephen J. Adler, president and editor-in-chief of Reuters.  We are outraged by this blatant attack on press freedom.  We call for authorities to release them immediately,  he said. A spokesman for Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi confirmed that the two journalists had been arrested.  Not only your reporters, but also the policemen who were involved in that case,  spokesman Zaw Htay said.  We will take action against those policemen and also the reporters.  In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert emphasized that the agency was  following this closely.  She said that U.S. Ambassador Scot Marciel on Wednesday had a conversation with two government officials in Myanmar who seemed  genuinely unaware  of the situation.   We care about the safety and security of international reporters who are simply just trying to do their jobs. So we re going to continue to try to stay on that,  Nauert said.  The U.S. embassy in Yangon said in a statement posted on its website on Wednesday it was  deeply concerned by the highly irregular arrests of two Reuters reporters after they were invited to meet with police officials in Yangon last night .  For a democracy to succeed, journalists need to be able to do their jobs freely,  the embassy said.  We urge the government to explain these arrests and allow immediate access to the journalists.   The European Union s mission in Yangon also voiced concern.  The EU delegation is closely following their case and we call on the Myanmar authorities to ensure the full protection of their rights,  it said in a statement.  Media freedom is the foundation of any democracy.  The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists called for the reporters  immediate and unconditional release.  These arrests come amid a widening crackdown which is having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance,  said Shawn Crispin, CPJ s senior Southeast Asia representative. Wa Lone, who joined Reuters in July 2016, has covered a range of stories, including the flight of Rohingya refugees from Rakhine in 2016 and, in much larger numbers, this year. He has written about military land grabs and the killing of ruling party lawyer Ko Ni in January. This year he jointly won an honorable mention from the Society of Publishers in Asia for Reuters coverage of the Rakhine crisis in 2016.  He previously worked for The Myanmar Times, where he covered Myanmar s historic 2015 elections, and People s Age, a local weekly newspaper, where his editor was Myanmar s current Minister of Information Pe Myint. Kyaw Soe Oo, an ethnic Rakhine Buddhist from state capital Sittwe, has worked with Reuters since September. He has covered the impact of the Aug. 25 attacks on police and army posts in the northern Rakhine, and reported from the central part of the state where local Buddhists have been  enforcing segregation between Rohingya and Rakhine communities. He previously worked for Root Investigation Agency, a local news outlet focused on Rakhine issues.  I have been arrest  were the four words that Wa Lone texted to Reuters Myanmar Bureau Chief Antoni Slodkowski on Tuesday evening to let him know what was happening. Very soon after that Wa Lone s phone appeared to have been switched off. Over the next 24 hours, Reuters colleagues in Yangon filed a missing persons report, went to three police stations, and asked a series of government officials what had happened to the two reporters.

Trumpâ€™s campaign released an open letter on Tuesday from about 90 retired generals and military officials endorsing his presidential campaign, urging a â€œlong overdue course correction in our national security posture. â€ The letter in support of Mr. Trump, signed by 88 retired military figures, comes as the campaign prepares for a week focused on national security, with a forum hosted by NBC and MSNBC on Wednesday evening alongside Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. â€œThe 2016 election affords the American people an urgently needed opportunity to make a long overdue course correction in our national security posture and policy,â€ the letter states. â€œAs retired senior leaders of Americaâ€™s military, we believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world,â€ the generals and admirals write. â€œFor this reason, we support Donald Trumpâ€™s candidacy to be our next commander in chief. â€ Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, is seeking to blunt an edge that Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, has established either from retired military figures like Gen. John R. Allen, or from the tacit boost she could receive from Republican national security and foreign policy experts who have denounced Mr. Trump. And Mr. Trumpâ€™s reorganized campaign is looking to craft an image of him as a palatable commander in chief, particularly ahead of his first debate with Mrs. Clinton on Sept. 26. The group of signatories was put together by Maj. Gen. Sidney Shachnow of the Army, a Holocaust survivor, and Rear Adm. Charles Williams of the Navy. â€œI think it more than trumpsâ€ the list of people backing Mrs. Clinton, said Keith Kellogg, a retired Army lieutenant general who is advising Mr. Trump on national security. Describing the group as â€œnational security professionals for Trump,â€ Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army officer who had been under consideration to be Mr. Trumpâ€™s running mate, said it came together organically. â€œWe had to stop accepting names because we were running out of time,â€ he said. â€œThese were people that have been passing us ideas from national security to education ideas. â€ Some of the people listed on the letter had supported Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in the 2012 campaign, in the   to Election Day. Some were among those who had urged Congress to reject the nuclear deal with Iran. Still others have been known for making controversial statements, like Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin of the Army, who was criticized by President George W. Bush for describing the battle against Islamist terrorists as a religious proxy fight between a â€œChristian nationâ€ and the â€œidolâ€ of Islam. For Mr. Trump, who has proposed a ban on Muslim immigrants to halt the spread of the Islamic State, such comments are in line with his own over the last year. Lt. Gen. Thomas G. McInerney of the Air Force, who is also listed on the letter and is a Fox News military analyst, has previously submitted court documents challenging President Obamaâ€™s eligibility to serve as president, accusing him of not having been born in the United States, an accusation Mr. Trump himself once raised. General Kellogg declined to evaluate past remarks from the military figures, saying they had served their country and had earned their right to speak. In the letter, the group expresses concern that the government will persist â€œin the practices that have brought us to this present passâ€ after a series of budget cuts. â€œFor this reason, we support Donald Trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, to secure our borders, to defeat our Islamic supremacist adversaries and restore law and order domestically,â€ they write. â€œWe urge our fellow Americans to do the same. â€ Mr. Trump, who often mentions veterans in his campaign speeches, said in a statement, â€œI thank each of them for their service and their confidence in me to serve as commander in chief.

By a vote of 69 to 59, members of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh approved plans to request a referendum on independence that could take place just before Britain completes its withdrawal from the European Union, a process known as Brexit. That timing has already been rejected by Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who must agree to any legally binding referendum on Scotlandâ€™s future. Nevertheless, the Scottish Parliamentâ€™s vote sets the stage for a constitutional tussle between London and Edinburgh, and it illustrates the   and destabilizing, consequences of Britainâ€™s divisive decision in June to withdraw from the European Union. In that referendum, 52 percent of voters chose to leave the European Union. But Scotland voted, 62 percent to 38 percent, to remain in the bloc, illustrating a divergence between Scottish and English politics that poses an existential risk to Britain. In Northern Ireland, too, a majority voted to remain in the European Union, amid fears that a withdrawal could weaken the peace process there. The Scottish vote came on the eve of a historic day for a British government intent on disentangling itself from more than four decades of European integration. On Wednesday, Mrs. May is expected to send formal notification of Britainâ€™s desire to leave the bloc by invoking Article 50 of its governing treaty. Late Tuesday, Mrs. Mayâ€™s office issued a photograph of the prime minister signing the letter its delivery will start the clock on a negotiation scheduled to last two years. During that time, Mrs. May aims to agree to divorce terms and to negotiate a new economic relationship with the countries that remain in the European Union. In a speech that she is expected to deliver on Wednesday, she will argue that as Britons â€œface the opportunities ahead of us on this momentous journey, our shared values, interests and ambitions can  â€”   and must  â€”   bring us together,â€ according to excerpts issued by her office. Mrs. May will also promise that, in negotiations, she will â€œrepresent every person in the whole United Kingdom,â€ including citizens of countries in the European Union who have made Britain their home. As she embarks on the talks to leave the bloc, Mrs. May knows that one of her many challenges is to secure a deal that helps avert a breakup of Britain. But because of her control over the timing, a referendum on Scottish independence is unlikely to happen anytime soon. The vote on Tuesday empowers Scotlandâ€™s   first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to formally request a referendum, but she already knows Mrs. Mayâ€™s answer: not now. The British government plans to withhold agreement at least until it has secured its departure from the bloc, scheduled for the first half of 2019. On Tuesday, David Mundell, the British governmentâ€™s Scottish secretary, seemed to push the timetable further by saying that government â€œwonâ€™t be entering into any negotiations at all until the Brexit process is complete. â€ That hints at a date beyond the British withdrawal and after any further transitional period, perhaps several years later. Nevertheless, Britainâ€™s vote has given Ms. Sturgeonâ€™s governing Scottish National Party a reason to demand another independence referendum, less than three years after it lost the last one in 2014. At that time, Scots were told that if they voted to leave Britain, they would lose their place in the European Union. They may now lose it anyway. Ms. Sturgeon argued that Scots should have the right to choose between Brexit â€œor becoming an independent country, able to chart our own course and create a true partnership of equals across these islands. â€ Ms. Sturgeon argues that the shape of any Brexit deal should be known by autumn 2018. Scots should then have the opportunity to try, through independence, to stay in the European Union, or at least in its single market and customs union, she has said. But with London intent on blocking a referendum anytime soon, Ms. Sturgeonâ€™s best hope may be for Mrs. Mayâ€™s stalling tactics to backfire  â€”   annoying Scots enough to persuade a majority to support independence if they finally have the chance to vote.", "output": "1.

Republicans control both chambers but have only a 52-to-48 Senate majority, meaning they can lose no more than two votes and still pass their tax bill, which Democrats oppose.  The following are the Republican lawmakers to watch: The Florida senator and former presidential contender said on Thursday he will vote against the tax plan if its proposed refundable amount for the child tax credit is not increased. Rubio told reporters that tax negotiators have made many changes to the legislation, including lowering the top rate paid by wealthy individuals.  â€œMy concern is that if you found the money to lower the top rate ... you canâ€™t find a little bit to at least somewhat increase the refundable portion of it?â€ Rubio asked.  The Utah senator also is unhappy with the legislationâ€™s child tax credit approach and â€œundecidedâ€ on whether he will vote for the measure if there are no changes, his spokesman has told Reuters. Lee and Rubio are in negotiations aimed at making more of the tax credit refundable so more low-income families can benefit from it, his office said on Thursday. The Maine moderate has said she cannot say whether she will be supportive â€œuntil I see the bill.â€ Republican leaders persuaded Collinsâ€™ to support the Senateâ€™s version of the bill earlier this month by promising to take up two healthcare provisions before the end of the year that would help mitigate her concerns about repealing Obamacareâ€™s â€œindividual mandate.â€ Republican tax writers also included amendments offered by Collins to woo her support. One preserves the deductibility of property-tax payments at a cap of $10,000. The final bill goes further by preserving the same deduction for state and local income-tax payments. Corker, a deficit hawk from Tennessee, stalled momentum on the Senate tax bill earlier this month, then ended up voting against it due to its expansion of the federal deficit. Nonpartisan government estimates have shown the Republican tax bill will expand the deficit by about $1.5 trillion in a decade, or $1 trillion after accounting for economic growth. Corker has said this week of the compromise bill: â€œMy deficit concerns have not been alleviated.â€ The Arizona conservative voted for the Senate tax bill earlier this month after announcing he had succeeded in eliminating an $85 billion expensing â€œbudget gimmick.â€ Flake also got a commitment from Senate leaders and the Trump administration to work on permanent protections for immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. Flake has not yet said whether he will support the compromise bill and was not specific about his hesitation in brief hallway remarks to reporters this week. Â Â Â  The Arizona senator, war hero and former presidential nominee voted for the Senate bill but his office said this week he is undergoing treatment for side effects of cancer therapy at a military hospital outside Washington. McCain, 81, missed non-tax votes this week. His office said he â€œlooks forward to returning to work as soon as possible.â€  The Mississippi senator, who also voted for the Senate bill, was absent from Capitol Hill for nearly a month earlier this year and has missed votes in recent weeks. Cochranâ€™s office said the 80-year-old senator is in Washington and expects to vote for tax legislation next week. Vice President Mike Pence has delayed a planned trip to the Middle East in case his vote is needed to break a tie on the final tax bill. Pence has played the role of dealmaker during Senate negotiations, assuring both Collins and Flake their concerns about the legislation would be addressed. Johnson endorsed the Senate bill after getting a 23 percent tax deduction for pass-through business income.

Over lunch in the Swedish city of Gothenburg on Friday, they discussed and gave political support to a European Commission proposal to create a European Education Area, in which the EU could help promote studies across its various nations. The idea is to foster a European identity by  letting more people study in countries across the bloc, emphasizing language learning and engendering more cooperation between universities, including on curricula.   During our meeting today, we established political support for these ideas,  the chairman of the leaders  meeting Donald Tusk told a news conference. The initiative comes as the Union, about to lose its second biggest economy Britain, seeks to make itself more appealing to European citizens, many of whom find the often highly technical or legal issues, which the EU deals with, disconnected from their everyday lives. The Erasmus exchange program of studying abroad is one of the most recognizable and popular EU policies. It has already been used by 9 million Europeans. Appreciation for it is growing fast, the Commission said, adding that 90 percent of Erasmus students, who typically spend a year at a university in another EU country, come back with an increased awareness of common European values.  As we look to Europe s future, we need ... a driver for unity. Education is key, because it is education that ...helps us... develop a European identity,  Commissioner for Education Tibor Navracsics said. Scaling up the scheme could see 2 million more people taking part in Erasmus over the next 2 years, the Commission said, although leaders were cautious about the funding this would require. Talks on the money would start with discussions on the next seven-year EU budget that starts from 2020. EU leaders also backed the idea that by early 2019, students in the EU should have an electronic student card enabling secure exchange of data like student records and academic attributes and access to services like course materials, enrolment services, online libraries in host institutions and countries.  By 2025 we should live in a Europe in which learning, studying and doing research is not hampered by borders but where spending time in another Member State to study, learn or work is the norm,  Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen said. The Commission wants to set a goal that all university students should speak two languages in addition to their mother tongue by 2025, improve computer literacy and create a network of world-class European universities that can work together.

The June 27-July 1 poll showed a 9.4 percentage point lead for the former secretary of state over the New York businessman, down slightly from an 11.2 point lead in a previous five-day poll that ended on June 28. Clinton had maintained a double-digit lead in the rolling poll since June 20, as she recovered from a brief boost in Trumpâ€™s numbers in the wake of the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, when he renewed a call for a ban on Muslim immigration. Among likely voters, 43.9 percent now support Clinton, compared with 34.5 percent for Trump. Another 21.7 percent of likely voters wouldnâ€™t support either candidate. Clinton is more popular among men and women, young people and minorities, college graduates, and people who live on incomes that are both lower and higher than the national average. Trump has an edge among whites, people with lower levels of education, older Americans and retirees, and he leads among people who frequently attend church. Overall, voters have increasingly sided with Clinton since mid-May, when the two were about even in the poll.  Trump is expected officially to become the Republican presidential nominee when the party holds its convention in another 2-1/2 weeks. Clinton is expected to become the Democratic nominee when the Democrats hold their convention a week later. The poll, which included responses from 1,080 likely voters, has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3.5 percentage points. Clintonâ€™s lead had widened to as much as 14 percentage points in the past two weeks as Republican leaders criticized Trump for his opposition to international trade agreements and a string of nativist comments about Hipsanics and Muslims.

The U.S. tax bill, passed by Republicans in Congress on Wednesday, limits deductions of state and local income and property taxes, known as SALT, to $10,000. The provision hits hardest Democratic-leaning states with high incomes, high property values and high taxes, like New York, New Jersey and California.  Law professors said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of statesâ€™ rights under the U.S. Constitution. Some political strategists see a win for Democrats regardless of how courts ultimately rule, saying that lawsuits could be used to keep the issue front and center for voters already largely disenchanted with the Republican party. â€œItâ€™s a no-brainer for them to do this,â€ said Democratic political consultant Phil Singer. â€œFailing to aggressively pursue a remedy would be political malpractice.â€ New Jersey Governor-elect Phil Murphy said during an appearance on CNBC on Wednesday that â€œeverything is on the tableâ€ for New Jersey to oppose the bill, including challenging its â€œlegality and constitutionality.â€  The governors of California and New York, Jerry Brown and Andrew Cuomo, have both previously said they were exploring legal challenges to SALT deduction limits. Their offices did not return requests for comment on Wednesday. Since President Donald Trump took office, blue states have aggressively used the courts to attempt to block the presidentâ€™s agenda, suing over his proposed travel ban, environmental policies and other measures. William Oâ€™Reilly, a conservative political consultant in New York, said the SALT deduction issue would likely add to Republicansâ€™ â€œsuburbia problemâ€ among college-educated voters ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. â€œThey already had one because of this presidentâ€™s style,â€ Oâ€™Reilly said. Darien Shanske, a tax law professor at the University of California Davis School of Law, said the governors would probably argue that restricting the SALT deduction, which dates back to the introduction of the federal income tax in 1862, violates the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s 10th Amendment that protects statesâ€™ rights. Shanske and other tax experts said the federalism argument would need to overcome the U.S. Supreme Courtâ€™s historically broad interpretations of Congressâ€™ 16th Amendment power to impose taxes. â€œAs a general matter, nothing prevents the federal government from changing the SALT deduction,â€ said David Gamage, a professor of tax law at Indiana Universityâ€™s Maurer School of Law. In a frequently cited 1934 decision, the Supreme Court called tax deductions a â€œlegislative graceâ€ rather than a right, and said Congress has broad leeway to abolish them. The court reiterated this view in a 1988 decision allowing Congress to remove a federal tax exemption for interest on some state and local bonds.  Kirk Stark, a professor of tax law at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, said there is a slight possibility that a federalism argument against limiting the SALT deduction could gain traction. â€œCourts create new law all the time,â€ he said, noting that decisions on matters this sweeping tend to become political. But some legal experts noted that the stateâ€™s rights argument is more typically a conservative position. Using it to challenge the SALT provision could be a move that Democratic governors come to regret in the future, said Daniel Hemel, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.   â€œThe progressive agenda depends on the federal government being able to raise revenue and the Supreme Court not getting in the way of that,â€ Hemel said.", "output": "1.

This is all, however, missing an importantÂ point: Clinton was wrong to divide Trump voters between the bigoted and economically anxious because many are both, and the two things are interrelated. For many, itâ€™s just one big basket. Clinton, in drawing a distinction between the racists and the justly upset, echoes a broader and mostly unhelpful debate about whether Trump supporters are motivated by economic anxiety or bigotry: The clearÂ answer, contrary to Matthew Yglesias and company, is â€œoften both.â€\n\nYes, Trump is getting a lot of support from professional racists on the white supremacist and alt-right, and reducing his base of support to any single constituency is a foolâ€™s errand. But for many Trump voters, anger and anxiety over economic decline and precarity, the rising status of women and people of color, demographic change caused by immigration, and the countryâ€™s waning global power after more than a decade of costly and futile global warfare, are all wrapped into one big sense of foreboding terror. Trump promises relief and a reversion to something that was, in senses both real and imagined, better.\n\nThere is a lot thatâ€™s new about Trump. But the intersection of exploitative economics and white supremacy certainly isnâ€™t: White economic anxiety isÂ used to foment racism, and racism is manipulatedÂ to further elite economic interests.\n\nAs Michelle Alexander has written, Americaâ€™s racial caste system has long been perpetuated by â€œappealing to the racism and vulnerability of lower-class whites, a group of people who are understandably eager to ensure that they never find themselves trapped at the bottom of the American totem pole.â€\n\nThe Southern slave-owning aristocracy and the Jim Crow governments that took power after Reconstructionâ€™s defeat peddled white supremacy to protect a political-economic order that not only terrorized blacks but that also kept poor whites on the margins. As historian Ira Katznelson detailed in â€œFear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of Our Time,â€ Southern Democrats during the New Deal era used their hold on Congress to leverage this divide and conquer logic on the national scene. They blockedÂ civil rights measuresÂ and alsoÂ obstructed the growth ofÂ aÂ labor movement poised to improve the condition of workers across the racial divide and in doing soÂ threaten Jim Crow. Later, the modern conservative movement once again used racism toward economically reactionary ends, employing â€œracial dog whistles to transmute white anxiety into support for conservative economic policies that have harmed us all,â€ as Ian Haney-LÃ³pez and Heather McGhee wroteÂ forÂ The Nation. â€œBeginning in the 1970s, conservatives deployed a highly racialized strategy that relentlessly linked public institutions to undeserving minorities in order to undo the countryâ€™s social contract,â€ Haney-LÃ³pez and McGhee continued. â€œThe reactionary economic agenda made possible by dog-whistle politics is responsible not just for the devaluing of black lives but for the declining fortunes of the majority of white families.â€ Talking about poor and working class people like they are research specimens and not human beings to very wealthy people at an exclusive fundraiser tends to not be a good look, as Barack Obama and Mitt Romney both discovered. But itâ€™s not just bad optics. Itâ€™s crummy politics. The business-friendly agenda historically embraced by the Clintons fails to answer working-class white peopleâ€™s economic concerns and in doing so actually fuels the fires of racism. Opposing racism as some transcendent and ahistorical force obscures the fact that racism functions to not only keep people of color down but also to keep the 1Â percent in charge. Americaâ€™s racial caste system depends on white supremacy to ensure white privileges andÂ oligarchic prerogatives. And so Clinton is right: We should understand and empathize with many Trump voters â€” not because establishment liberalism has much to offer them but becauseÂ their problems are bound up withÂ those of the people whom they hate.", "output": "1.

Dear Watchers, Toss the confetti, pop the champagne, put on the nice sweatpants: Weâ€™re in for a great TV week. New shows, returning favorites, a bird documentary  â€”   heaven is a place on earth. And that place is within our televisions (and computers and tablets and whatnots). If you find yourself in need of some TV guidance, Iâ€™d love to answer your questions, or settle your disputes. I am, as I ever was, and ever shall be: watching@nytimes. com. And a â€œ1776â€ fan. Happy watching! Watch â€œGomorrah,â€ Wednesday, 10 p. m. SundanceTV. First came Roberto Savianoâ€™s 2007 nonfiction book about Neapolitan organized crime. Then came the 2009 movie. Now thereâ€™s this   Italian 2014   airing weekly in   chunks. If youâ€™re looking for romantic, sweeping Italian vistas, try â€œThe Wine Show. â€ â€œGomorrahâ€ is violent and bleak, almost suffocating. There are some familiar   beats here, but the cinematography alone is worth tuning in for. Watch â€œHalt and Catch Fire,â€ Season 3 premiere, Tuesday, 9 p. m. AMC.  The new season of this   drama transplants the show to Silicon Valley from Texas  â€”   sort of a bummer, unless you are dying for another show about how people in California are just a little different from the rest of us. Thank god enough of the showâ€™s emotional core  â€”   Donna, mostly  â€”   is still intact. This   premiere highlights the strengths and shortcomings of â€œHalt. â€ (The first episode is available now on AMC.) â€œMad Menâ€ is superficially about advertising, but more deeply itâ€™s about constructing identity. â€œThe Americansâ€ includes tales of espionage, but foundationally is about defining truth. When itâ€™s its best, â€œHaltâ€ is about the need for human bonds, and how that need will override all other behaviors. Too often, though, itâ€™s just about how computers and the internet worked (or didnâ€™t) in the â€™80s. Watch â€œThe Profit,â€ Tuesday, 10 p. m. CNBC (Previous episodes are on Hulu). The entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis travels the country and invests his own money in struggling small businesses, on the condition that he be â€œ100 percent in charge. â€ If you like shows like â€œTabathaâ€™s Salon Takeoverâ€ or â€œKitchen Nightmares,â€ but wish they were more supportive and had better   messages, â€œThe Profitâ€ is for you. Lemonis is calm and direct, and he doesnâ€™t yell at anyone or look to humiliate people anyone who comes across poorly does so on their own. This weekâ€™s Season 4 premiere is another   venture (the show has included several such businesses) but more important, Lemonis seems to have retired his HermÃ¨s belt. Watch â€œDallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team,â€ Thursday, 9 p. m. CMT. Warning: The season premieres of â€œDallas Cowboys Cheerleadersâ€ tend to be the worst episode of the season. The early auditions include too many aspiring cheerleaders who clearly have no chance of making the team, and too many randos weighing in. (Being married to a football player does not make you an expert in dancing.) But once the show   into gear, itâ€™s one of the most absorbing, brutal   reality shows going. The level of drive and athleticism on display is staggering, and if youâ€™ve ever wondered just how extrinsic oneâ€™s image can be, this is the show for you. Everything is up for scrutiny: Are her eyes just too intense? Is that smile a little forced? Do her breasts seem natural enough? Hair: too severe? Every inch of the womenâ€™s bodies is critiqued candidly and often, which can be galling, but itâ€™s almost refreshing to hear these narrow constraints articulated so openly. Watch â€œToucan Nation,â€ Wednesday, 10 p. m. Animal Planet. Warning: This doc contains very sad footage of an abused toucan. But Grecia survives! And inspires the nation of Costa Rica! Viva Grecia and his new beak. On Monday at 8 p. m. ESPN2 has â€œPin Kingsâ€  â€”   wrestling, not bowling, alas. Itâ€™s the true story of high school wrestling teammates whose lives took different paths: One became a D. E. A. agent, one a cocaine kingpin. On Tuesday at 10 p. m. the tattoo contest show â€œInk Masterâ€ returns to SpikeTV. And Thursday at 8 p. m. on Logo, itâ€™s the premiere of the new season of â€œRuPaulâ€™s All Stars Drag Race. â€ Get swept up in the drama and passion of the dancers MarÃ­a Nieves Rego and Juan Carlos Copes in the recent Argentine documentary â€œOur Last Tango. â€ Once a renowned couple from the Buenos Aires tango scene, the two split professionally after their marriage fell apart. Now the veteran dancers reflect on their lifeâ€™s work and tumultuous   relationship before a   reunion. â€œOur Last Tangoâ€ goes a step further than the standard memoir doc, creatively reinterpreting moments from Regoâ€™s childhood and her relationship with Copes into stylish modern and tango dance numbers. Between the coupleâ€™s colorful anecdotes and impressive choreography, the movie makes it easy to get caught up in its bittersweet story. (Watch on Netflix)  â€”   Monica Castillo", "output": "1.

The Republican-dominated legislature begins a 30-day special session on Tuesday with 20 items on the agenda, including one of the â€œbathroom billsâ€ that have been a flashpoint in U.S. culture wars. Supporter of the legislation have said it is a common-sense measure that protects public safety. Critics call it discriminatory. Texas, the most powerful Republican-controlled state, could lose about $5.6 billion through 2026 and businesses could find it difficult to recruit top talent if such a measure is enacted, according to the stateâ€™s leading employer organization. â€œThe distraction of a bathroom bill pulls us away from being competitive as a state,â€ Jeff Moseley, chief executive of the Texas Association of Business, told a rally outside the Capitol.  â€œOn this discussion, conservatives can disagree with conservatives,â€ said Moseley, whose group has typically aligned itself with the stateâ€™s Republican leaders. The legislation restricts access to places like bathrooms and locker rooms based on the gender listed on peopleâ€™s birth certificates and not the gender with which they identify. A similar law in North Carolina, partially repealed in March, prompted the relocation of sporting events and economic boycotts that was estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. The stakes are higher in Texas, which has an economy larger than Russiaâ€™s. A bill similar to North Carolinaâ€™s passed the Texas Senate in the regular session and was killed by pro-business Republican leaders in the House, who ran out the clock on the measure. The bathroom billâ€™s main backer, Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a social conservative who sets the state Senateâ€™s legislative agenda, has said economic losses would be inconsequential. â€œ(The Texas Republican majority) want to maintain separate restrooms, locker rooms and shower facilities for men and women and boys and girls, and they donâ€™t care if the media thinks it is politically incorrect,â€ his political campaign said in a statement on Monday. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Joe Straus and companies including IBM, American Airlines, Apple and Southwest Airlines have spoken out against the bill. â€œOn the bathroom bill, there is no real compromise because even the most mild bill is going to be interpreted as discriminatory,â€ said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston.", "output": "1.

Trump on Tuesday appeared to raise the possibility that gun rights supporters could take matters into their own hands if Hillary Clinton is elected president and appoints judges who favor stricter gun control measures. Repeating his contention that Mrs. Clinton wanted to abolish the right to bear arms, Mr. Trump warned at a rally here that it would be â€œa horrible dayâ€ if Mrs. Clinton were elected and got to appoint a tiebreaking Supreme Court justice. â€œIf she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,â€ Mr. Trump said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added: â€œAlthough the Second Amendment people  â€”   maybe there is, I donâ€™t know. â€ Oblique as it was, Mr. Trumpâ€™s remark quickly elicited a wave of condemnation from Democrats, gun control advocates and others, who accused him of suggesting violence against Mrs. Clinton or liberal jurists. Bernice A. King, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called Mr. Trumpâ€™s words â€œdistasteful, disturbing, dangerous. â€ Mrs. Clintonâ€™s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, expressed disbelief. â€œNobody who is seeking a leadership position, especially the presidency, the leadership of the country, should do anything to countenance violence, and thatâ€™s what he was saying,â€ Mr. Kaine said in Austin, Tex. He called Mr. Trumpâ€™s remark â€œa window into the soul of a person who is just temperamentally not suited to the task. â€ And Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said Mr. Trumpâ€™s statement was â€œrepulsive  â€”   literally using the Second Amendment as cover to encourage people to kill someone with whom they disagree. â€ â€œFor Trump, violence has become a standard talking point, a common punch line, and even a campaign strategy,â€ Mr. Gross said. Paul D. Ryan, the Republican House speaker who has had a tense relationship with Mr. Trump, told reporters on Tuesday night that the remarks sounded â€œlike a joke gone bad. â€ He added: â€œYou should never joke about that. I hope he clears it up quickly. â€ Mr. Trump and his campaign did not treat his remark as a joke instead, they insisted he was merely urging gun rights supporters to vote as a bloc against Mrs. Clinton. â€œThe Second Amendment people have tremendous power because they are so united,â€ he told a CBS affiliate in North Carolina late Tuesday. In an interview with Fox News, Mr. Trump grew adamant. â€œThere can be no other interpretation,â€ he said, adding, â€œI mean, give me a break. â€ But at his rally earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had actually been discussing what could happen once Mrs. Clinton was president, not before the election. And even many in the audience seemed caught by surprise. Video showed a man just over Mr. Trumpâ€™s shoulder go   and turn to his companion, apparently in disbelief, when Mr. Trump made the remark. The uproar over Mr. Trumpâ€™s    remark came as his campaign has been faced with a series of public opinion surveys showing him quickly losing ground to Mrs. Clinton, and just a day after his campaign called his delivery of a prepared economic speech in Detroit, evidence of a newfound political discipline. Mr. Trumpâ€™s fellow opponents of gun control stood by him, focusing on his depiction of Mrs. Clinton as a threat to the Second Amendment. â€œDonald Trump is absolutely correct,â€ said Jennifer Baker, a strategist for the National Rifle Association. â€œIf Hillary Clinton is elected, there is nothing we can do to stop her from nominating an   Supreme Court justice who will vote to overturn the individual right of   citizens to own a gun in their home for protection. â€ The association also began running a new commercial characterizing Mrs. Clinton as â€œone of the wealthiest women in politicsâ€ and calling her a hypocrite for favoring gun restrictions while having been â€œprotected by armed guards for 30 years. â€ Her gun policies, the ad says, would leave ordinary people â€œdefenseless. â€ Veiled references to gun violence have tripped up candidates before. In 2010, Sharron Angle, a Nevada Republican challenging the Senate majority leader at the time, Harry Reid, severely damaged her unsuccessful candidacy while discussing the importance of the Second Amendment. â€œWhen you read that Constitution and the founding fathers, they intended this to stop tyranny,â€ she said, adding: â€œItâ€™s to defend ourselves. And you know, Iâ€™m hoping that weâ€™re not getting to Second Amendment remedies. I hope the vote will be the cure for the Harry Reid problems. â€ Mrs. Clinton herself learned the hard way: In June 2008, shortly before she conceded defeat in her Democratic primary contest with Barack Obama, she defended her perseverance in a way that critics said alluded to the possibility that Mr. Obama could be gunned down. â€œWe all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California,â€ Mrs. Clinton said. She apologized hours later. Mr. Trump did not repeat his violent insinuation at a later event in Fayetteville, N. C. But Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who has championed gun control since the Sandy Hook mass shooting in his state, called Mr. Trumpâ€™s remarks â€œdisgusting and embarrassing and sad. â€ â€œThis isnâ€™t play,â€ Mr. Murphy wrote. â€œUnstable people with powerful guns and an unhinged hatred for Hillary are listening to you, @realDonaldTrump. â€ The condemnation from Mr. Trumpâ€™s critics across the political spectrum was deep. On Twitter, the conservative writer John Podhoretz, in a series of posts, wrote that Mr. Trump had implied that all Second Amendment supporters were â€œpotential assassins. â€ He added that a presidentâ€™s words â€œCANNOT MEAN NOTHING. They are the most important words spoken in the world. â€ And Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, wrote on Twitter that the Secret Service should investigate Mr. Trump for making a death threat against Mrs. Clinton: â€œDonald Trump suggested someone kill Sec. Clinton. We must take people at their word. â€ A Secret Service spokesman, who refused to identify himself, said that the agency was â€œaware of the commentsâ€ but did not elaborate. Others seized on Mr. Trumpâ€™s remark as an occasion for mockery. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump â€œmakes death threats because heâ€™s a pathetic coward who canâ€™t handle the fact that heâ€™s losing to a girl. â€ Mr. Trumpâ€™s campaign events have grown increasingly vitriolic, with angry chants and jeers directed at Mrs. Clinton. People at his rallies have, with greater frequency, loudly called for violence against Mrs. Clinton  â€”   catcalls that Mr. Trump has generally let pass. And on Saturday, Mr. Trump praised his New Hampshire state   State Representative Al Baldasaro, who said recently that Mrs. Clinton deserved to face a firing squad over the F. B. I. â€™s investigation of her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. In Wilmington on Tuesday, chants of â€œlock her up,â€ which first gained traction during the Republican National Convention, were loud and frequent before Mr. Trump took the stage. But one speaker, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, tried to tamp those down. â€œNo, no, weâ€™re here to beat her, and keep her out of Washington,â€ Mr. Giuliani said. He was interrupted by the same chant minutes later.", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: SAN FRANCISCO  â€”   Google and Facebook have been taking steps to curb the number of false news articles propagated across their sites. On Wednesday, the Silicon Valley companies showed that they were still in the early stages of their battle to limit misinformation online. In a blog post, Google said it had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from its AdSense advertising network near the end of last year, after putting into effect a policy in November to choke off websites that try to deceive users from its online ad service. On the same day, Facebook introduced changes to its Trending Topics feature  â€”   a part of the social network that some have blamed for spreading false information  â€”   to better promote reliable news articles. Yet taken together, the efforts showed how the fight against fake news remains a work in progress. Googleâ€™s bans were a drop in the bucket compared with the almost two million publishers that use AdSense. Facebookâ€™s new measures were part of a continuing series of small experiments by the company to find out what worked best in displaying news to its users. â€œWe genuinely asked Google and Facebook for â€˜moonshots,â€™â€ said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. â€œWe appreciate the work, but based on the numbers, thatâ€™s hardly even running in place. â€ Google and Facebook have been in something of a   situation in recent months when it comes to fake news. Both companies have been grappling with a widespread backlash over how their sites may have spread rumors on a vast scale, and how little responsibility they take for any of the content that appears on their platforms. The issue came to a head after the American presidential election, when commentators accused Facebook in particular of swaying voters to President Trump through misleading and untrue news articles. In response, both companies have tried various measures to limit fake news. Google in November said it would ban sites that spread misinformation from AdSense as a way to impair how such sites make money. That same month, Facebook updated some of its policy language, which already said it would not display ads on sites that show misleading or illegal content, to include fake news sites. Facebook has since introduced other changes, including consulting   news organizations like The Associated Press and ABC News about the accuracy of articles that users report as being false. Googleâ€™s blog post on Wednesday was the first time the company explained the results of its moves against publishers that spread misinformation. The search giant said it reviewed 550 sites â€œsuspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizationsâ€ in November and December. It took action against 340 of those sites and kicked nearly 200 publishers off its network permanently. Google was careful not to say that these were fake news sites, only sites that deceive users by misrepresenting themselves or their content. This month, Media Matters noted that Google changed the language of its advertising policy, removing the words â€œfake news. â€ Google said the language change noted by Media Matters involved examples that help explain its policy but were not changes to the actual policy. Google declined to identify the sites or publishers it banned. Before taking steps to thwart fake news publishers, Google had an existing policy that outlawed publishers of â€œmisrepresentative content,â€ such as websites peddling   schemes or counterfeit goods. It expanded this policy to include sites impersonating news organizations. Google was pulled into the fake news debate when Mediaite reported that, in the days after the election, the top result on a Google search for â€œfinal election vote count 2016â€ was a link to an article that incorrectly stated that Mr. Trump, who won the Electoral College, was ahead of his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, in the popular vote. Google said that its search algorithms fell short but that the company would continue to work to improve its results. The AdSense system is a major revenue driver for independent web publishers who rely on the network to deliver display advertising on their sites. The publishers are paid when a reader views or clicks on those ads, with a portion of the proceeds going to Google. AdSense is one of the largest advertising networks on the web with nearly two million publishers using the system. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the number of sites it has banned since November. Trending Topics is a feature on the social network that tells people what popular topics are being discussed on the site. Apart from more transparency around headlines, the changes to the feature on Wednesday included identifying popular topics through the number of publishers posting articles on Facebook about a piece of news, rather than engagement around a single article. â€œTodayâ€™s update may also help prevent hoaxes and fake news from appearing in Trending because the updated system identifies groups of articles shared on Facebook instead of relying solely on mentions of a topic,â€ the company said in a blog post. Still, industry watchers remain skeptical about the efficacy of these moves. â€œNothing drives clicks better than when the headline is exactly what people want to hear or believe,â€ Ian Schafer, the chief executive and founder of Deep Focus, a digital advertising agency, referring specifically to Google. Mr. Schafer said that without significant changes to the economics and technology of online ads, banning individual sites would not produce change in the long run.", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Standing on the Third Street Bridge over the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, you can almost watch a community changing before your very eyes. On one side sits a    Whole Foods,   spinning in its vast parking lot. On the other, a cluster of   apartment towers is in the works, while the Ferrara Bros. concrete company, one of the largest in New York City, is preparing to relocate. The canal itself remains a murky Superfund site. The lone sentinel of the neighborhoodâ€™s postindustrial,   days is the   Batcave. A former Brooklyn Rapid Transit power station built in 1904, it was decommissioned in the 1950s and became a punk squat decades later, playing host to raucous dance parties and graffiti on practically every surface. Like many of the buildings lining the fetid waterway, it is poised for a rebirth. This year, the nonprofit Powerhouse Environmental Arts Foundation plans to break ground on a project that will provide a haven for two of the canalâ€™s most endangered species: artists and manufacturers. The foundation plans to renovate and expand the power station, turning it into a factory of sorts for the production of art. The project, the Powerhouse Workshop, will include metalwork, woodwork, printmaking, ceramics and fiber art, as well as exhibition space. â€œThe building has long been a destination for artists, and we wanted to keep it that way,â€ Katie Dixon, the foundationâ€™s executive director, said during a recent tour of the cavernous former turbine hall. The Powerhouse Workshop will share at least one thing with its tonier neighbors:   designers, namely Herzog  de Meuron, the Pritzker   Swiss firm, who may now qualify as the most famous architects to work within a Superfund site. In many ways, the workshop brings that   firm full circle. Herzog  de Meuronâ€™s breakout project was the Tate Modern, which took the old Bankside Power Station and turned it into one of the most popular museums in London. In Brooklyn, the designers are attempting the reverse, transforming a hub of underground culture back into an industrial complex, albeit for manufacturing art. The foundation spent four years studying what to do with the power station after purchasing it in 2012 for $7 million. The initial thought was studio space, but after surveying artists, the Powerhouse team discovered a greater unmet need: fabricating the art. That need has been growing more acute, as the same real estate pressures pushing out artists are displacing the artisans and manufacturers who helped realize their work. The foundation anticipates that the project will create more than 100 jobs. Operations will spread across the existing turbine hall and a new structure that traces the form of the boiler house that stood next door before its demolition in the 1950s. â€œThe building always seemed very incomplete without the other third,â€ said Ascan Mergenthaler, a senior partner at Herzog  de Meuron who is overseeing the project. â€œAny addition should occupy the footprint of the original, so both become a whole again. â€ The new   structure is essentially a large rectangle imbued with Herzog  de Meuronâ€™s pyrotechnic modesty. Where the original building had a pitched roof and a pair of giant smokestacks, the new structure is flat. The original roofline will be visible, however, a ghost incised in the pattern of the facade. There had been discussions about creating new ventilation systems in the shape of the smokestacks, but that was deemed superfluous. â€œItâ€™s always a very slippery slope how much you let the original building influence your designs,â€ Mr. Mergenthaler said. â€œWe only take the things that make sense for operations today and throw the rest away. â€ One thing the Powerhouse will not be throwing away is the Batcaveâ€™s graffiti. While the building needs considerable structural work, and a portion of the bricks will have to be removed to make repairs, any old surfaces that can be preserved will be. â€œItâ€™s an incredible legacy for us to build on,â€ Ms. Dixon said. â€œThere are so many layers here, we donâ€™t want to take any away. We simply want to add our own. â€ Though few individual pieces in the Batcave are particularly notable, Henry Chalfant, a graffiti expert, remarked on a recent tour how the totality of the art is what makes it special, a reminder of the â€œoutlaw spacesâ€ that once populated much more of the city. â€œItâ€™s kind of a flashback coming in here for me, and being among all the graffiti,â€ Mr. Chalfant, who was a producer of the 1983 street art documentary â€œStyle Wars,â€ said. The top floor of the turbine hall soars 25 feet to a   roof currently open to the sky. The hope is to glass it over to create a staging ground for art in progress, as well as for events and exhibitions. The foundation, established by the philanthropist Joshua Rechnitz, has spent $400, 000 on the site so far and plans to start construction this fall. No zoning changes are required since the Powerhouse conforms to the areaâ€™s industrial use. The foundation declined to release a budget for the project, which is still out to bid. It plans to open the Powerhouse Workshop in 2020. Not far from the Powerhouse, the project is already generating excitement. At the BRT Printshop in Red Hook, Brooklyn, which produces screen prints, Luther Davis recently recalled telling some of his artist clients about the complex. â€œInstantly, they had ideas for new pieces and new processes, like painting on metal sheets or textiles,â€ Mr. Davis said. â€œJust imagine having all these amazing craftspeople sitting around, looking at work or sipping coffee, all the ideas they might have. You canâ€™t do that over the phone or email. â€ The Powerhouse Workshop hopes to welcome powerhouses of the art world as well as striving artists. The latter might even pay reduced fees that would be offset by the more established  â€”   and expensive  â€”   work of others. To Ms. Dixon, it is an epochal opportunity for the New York art scene. â€œEven Andy Warhol,â€ she said, â€œhad to leave the Factory to produce his work. â€", "output": "1. True"}

Gardner has never had a girlfriend. Now 20 and living for the first time in a dorm here at Western Kentucky University, he has designed a   experiment to find her. He ticks off the math. Two meals a day at the student dining hall, three courses per meal. Girls make up 57 percent of the 20, 068 students. And so, he sums up,   eyes triumphant, if he sits at a table with at least four new girls for every course, he should be able to meet all 11, 439 by graduation. â€œIâ€™m Crosby Gardner!â€ he announces each time he descends upon a fresh group, trying out the   script he had practiced in the universityâ€™s autism support program. â€œWhat is your name and what is your major?â€ The first generation of college students with an autism diagnosis is fanning out to campuses across the country. These growing numbers reflect the sharp rise in diagnosis rates since the 1990s, as well as the success of   interventions and efforts to include these students in mainstream activities. But while these young adults have opportunities that could not have been imagined had they been born even a decade earlier, their success in college is still a long shot. Increasingly, schools are realizing that most of these students will not graduate without comprehensive support like the Kelly Autism Program at Western Kentucky. Similar programs have been taking root at nearly 40 colleges around the country, including large public institutions like Eastern Michigan University, California State University, Long Beach, the University of Connecticut and Rutgers. For decades, universities have provided academic safety nets to students with physical disabilities and learning challenges like dyslexia. But students on the autism spectrum need a web of support that is far more nuanced and complex. Their presence on campus can be jarring. Mr. Gardner will unloose monologues  â€”   unfiltered,   and repetitive  â€”   that can set professorsâ€™ teeth on edge and lead classmates to snicker. When agitated, another student in Western Kentuckyâ€™s program calms himself by pacing, flapping his hands, then facing a corner, bumping his head four times and muttering. One young woman, lost on her way to class and not knowing how to ask for directions, had a   panic attack, shaking and sobbing violently. Autism affects the brainâ€™s early development of social and communication skills. A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder can encompass an array of people, from the moderately impaired and intellectually nimble like Mr. Gardner, a junior majoring in biochemistry, to adults with the cognitive ability of   . Until 2013, students who could meet college admission criteria would most likely have received a diagnosis of Aspergerâ€™s syndrome, which has since been absorbed into autism spectrum disorder. The social challenges of people on the spectrum can impede their likelihood of thriving not only in college, but also after graduation. Counselors in programs like Western Kentuckyâ€™s not only coach students who struggle to read social cues, but also serve as advocates when misreadings go terribly awry, such as not recognizing the rebuff of a sexual advance. When a professor complains about a student who interrupts lectures with a harangue, Michelle Elkins, who directs the Western Kentucky program, will retort: â€œI am not excusing his behavior. I am explaining his brain function. â€ At suppertime, the dining hall at Western Kentuckyâ€™s student union is crowded, clamorous and brightly lit. Students in the Kelly program, who often have sensory hypersensitivities as well as social discomfort, usually prefer eating alone in their rooms. But one night this fall, some gathered for a weekly dinner with peer mentors  â€”   students hired by the program to be tutors and social guides. The Kelly students tentatively approached a meeting place in the lobby. As they recognized their mentors among the milling crowd, relief flooded their faces. The meal began awkwardly. One Kelly student buried himself in a textbook. Another gazed around the dining hall, humming. Gradually, the mentors drew them out. How was your day? Have you tried any clubs? Jacob, a freshman from Tennessee who is in a Chinese immersion curriculum and asked that his last name not be used to protect his familyâ€™s privacy, said he had joined the French, Spanish and German clubs. â€œWhen do you sleep?â€ I inquired with a smile. A few mentors laughed appreciatively. Jacob looked puzzled. â€œI donâ€™t get the humor in that question,â€ he said. When the topic shifted to a social event coming up at the center  â€”   a video game party  â€”   conversational   was guaranteed. Even so, as various games were suggested, the dinner table exchanges were more proclamation than conversation: â€œIn my opinion, PokÃ©mon Go is a stupid idea,â€ Mr. Gardner shouted. Ms. Elkins fixed him with a look. â€œGood you added, â€˜in my opinion,â€™ Crosby,â€ she said. The autism programâ€™s home, a    clinical education building at the edge of the university, is a peaceful, dimly lit haven from the churning campus. The 45 undergraduates in the program spend three hours a day here, four days a week. They study, meeting with tutors, and confer with counselors and a psychologist to review myriad mystifying daily encounters. The counselors maintain ties with dorm supervisors, professors and the career center, mediating misunderstandings. By 2019, the program, which started with three students a little over a decade ago, anticipates being able to admit 77 students. Like most such programs on other campuses, it charges a fee W. K. U. â€™s is $5, 000 a semester, much of which may be covered by federal vocational rehabilitation funds. In addition to shoring up academic and organizational skills, the program aims to ease students into the social flow of campus. This year, group discussions will tackle topics that include sex and dating. Some of these students have enough   to feel the excruciating loneliness of exclusion. â€œOne student told me, â€˜I was so excited about college because I hear you donâ€™t get bullied there, and I donâ€™t know what thatâ€™s like,â€™â€ said Sarah   the programâ€™s manager. Others remain relatively oblivious to the social world surging around them. Impulse control is an issue for many of these students: They will stand up and abruptly leave class. Some need reminders about basic hygiene. Because having a roommate can be unnerving, most have single rooms in the dorms. But they all have the requisite academic ability: Before applying to the support program, they must be admitted by the university. Some are exceptionally bright. â€œI have a 4. 0 G. P. A. but David leaves me behind in the dust,â€ Liz Ramey, 19, a student mentor, said of David Merdian, a Kelly sophomore who studies mathematical economics with a concentration in actuarial science. With the programâ€™s help, some of the students, most of whom are male, can enter the   university directly from high school. Others first try community college. After Kaley Miller graduated from high school, relatives, who did not believe she could live independently, put her in a group home and then a residential home with elderly adults, where she spent her days doing factory piecework. Finally, at a psychiatristâ€™s suggestion, Ms. Millerâ€™s parents decided to let her try a college that provided support for students on the spectrum. When she moved into a W. K. U. dorm, Ms. Miller, 24, a junior and a meticulous art student, reacted in wonderment. â€œThere were so many people my age and everyone was so normal,â€ she said. In 2012, Andy Arnold, who was given an autism spectrum diagnosis as a child, enrolled as a freshman at Western Kentucky. â€œIt was terrifying,â€ he recalled. â€œI was anxious and went off my meds. Iâ€™d forget to shower and brush my teeth. I would do rituals, like walking around outside the dorm. I kept grabbing at the back of my neck. â€œI started skipping classes. I didnâ€™t really know how to study, so I fell behind quickly. I ate too much. I behaved irrationally to people. â€ He dropped out. He lived at home, taking online courses for a few years, then reapplied to W. K. U. Now 23, he is back at school  â€”   and this time, he is in the autism support program. â€œI feel less panicky,â€ Mr. Arnold said. â€œI like getting to know people here at the center. We have something in common. â€ It is hard to know how many students with autism attend   schools. A 2012 study in the journal Pediatrics found that about 50, 000 teenagers with the diagnosis turn 18 each year and 34. 7 percent attend college. Without support, though, few graduate. That is in part because many students with an autism diagnosis do not step forward, fearing stigma. Some experts speculate that for every college student on the spectrum who identifies himself or herself with a diagnosis, there may be two more who are undisclosed. But as the growth of the   neurodiversity movement prompts people on the spectrum to define themselves as different but not deficient, more students are emerging from the shadows. The Bridges to Adelphi program at Adelphi University in Garden City, N. Y. serves about 100 students with autism. At the University of Texas in Dallas, 450 students with the diagnosis have registered for services with the Student AccessAbility office. Their presence on campuses is also a testament to the tenacity of families and disability advocates who, since the 1990s, when awareness of autism began to mushroom, have pressed for earlier diagnoses and interventions. Much of that battle unfolded in public secondary schools, leading to more services. Over the last decade, officials at mainstream universities began realizing that growing numbers of spectrum students were being admitted  â€”   and, like Mr. Arnold, were foundering. It was one thing for administrators to authorize accommodations like extra time on tests for students with dyslexia or attention deficit disorder. But how should they bolster students whose behavior was the primary expression of the disability  â€”   who could not stop shouting out answers in class and feared dorm showers? And so the new autism support programs vary in emphasis. Some are based in disability resource centers, while others are in mental health offices, focusing on social skills and anxiety reduction. â€œOur mission is to help them transition into the university, be successful here, and then transition out of the university to be successful in adult life,â€ said Pamela Lubbers, who directs one of the countryâ€™s most structured, coordinated programs, with 17 students, at   Brunswick. Ms. Lubbers meets weekly with students, working them through a standardized â€œto doâ€ checklist to help them identify   tasks to feel less overwhelmed, review their goals (â€œDescribe the best social interactions you had this weekâ€) and  . (â€œYou think you left your I. D. on the campus bus. What steps will you take to find or replace it? â€) But even with support, these students often need extra time to graduate. Indeed, many do not make it that far. Some crumble under academic and organizational stress. Others succumb to campus allures like alcohol and drugs. And others are expelled on sexual harassment grounds. They are so eager to fit in that they may, for example, comply with the demands of a bully who says, â€œ â€˜Iâ€™ll be your friend and go to dinner with you every night next week if you kiss that girl,â€™â€ said Jane Thierfeld Brown, who consults with families and colleges about supporting students on the spectrum. But with support, there are also those, like Ryan Hodges, who surpass expectations. Mr. Hodges received his diagnosis at age 4. â€œIn high school did we know heâ€™d go to college? No,â€ said his father, Jeff, a Nashville businessman. â€œDid we hope? Yes. â€ They set their sights on W. K. U. because of the program. Now 23, Ryan has grown immeasurably in social confidence, his father said, and is on track to graduate at the end of this semester. Whether they are prepared for the next transition remains an open question. Most programs do not keep tabs on their students after graduation. Despite the career coaching offered for Kelly students, some still cannot present themselves well in job interviews. Living at home again, unemployed, they may regress. â€œThe goal is not necessarily a college degree but becoming an independent, successful adult,â€ Dr. Brown said. â€œAnd a bachelorâ€™s degree doesnâ€™t guarantee that. â€ Still, many graduates from Western Kentuckyâ€™s program are employed. Mrs.   who stays in touch with some through social media, mentions one who works in film, others in technology, some in retail, and another who is applying for graduate school in physics. What about their social lives? Mrs.   paused and looked at her lap. â€œSometimes Iâ€™m too scared to ask,â€ she said. Always with an eye toward life after college, the program encourages students to learn practical skills. Hence Western Kentuckyâ€™s weekly trip to Walmart. One recent Friday afternoon, Mrs.   drove seven students in the programâ€™s van, which resounded with cheerful non sequiturs. â€œI donâ€™t mean to be rude but could you not talk now?â€ one student told another. â€œYour voice is very loud in my head!â€ Mrs.   pulled into the parking lot and nudged the students out of the van. They ambled toward the store, blithely indifferent to incessantly roaming cars. Then she waved and drove off, leaving them to tackle the Walmart Supercenter on their own. In a frenzy, the group scattered. Some boys barreled up and down aisles, flinging items at random into their clattering shopping carts. Essentials: Twix. Strawberry Twizzlers. Doughnuts. Frosted cookies.   of Coke. Slippers. Napkins. PokÃ©mon cards. More PokÃ©mon cards. One boy decided he wanted to reheat chicken wings in his dorm. He needed a baking tin. But that meant locating the cookware aisle. Which meant finding an employee, then asking for directions. Scary! Checking out was another challenge. For the studentsâ€™ entire lives, their purchases had been paid for by adults. Now they were peering at register totals, fumbling for credit cards, swiping and swiping, then attempting the chip system, one way and then the other, forgetting PINs. Over all, they did just fine. They reassembled outside, sweating and smiling, surrounded by the fruits of their considerable shopping labors. Ms. Ramey, the student mentor, picked them up. On the drive back to school, the students toggled between yakking about their shopping victories and falling silent, drained. Ms. Ramey pulled up to their dorms, one by one. One by one, they unloaded their bags and, without so much as a â€œthank youâ€ or even â€œgoodbye,â€ set off. â€œHave a good weekend!â€ she kept prompting. Startled, each boy looked back at the car, bewildered. Another missed social cue? Oh, right! Jolted, some remembered to smile, and even to wave farewell.", "output": "1. True"}

Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State.  â€”   Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 24, 2017,   Musk responded to the January 24 tweet by The Economist that Tillerson, as U. S. Secretary of State would have the â€œintegrity to talk sense to his boss,â€ by supportively commenting, â€œThis may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State. â€ The blogosphere exploded as the leftâ€™s social justice warriors lashed out at Musk with viciously colorful language that Musk was a fraud and a sellout to Trump and to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rumors also flew that Musk was angling for a new carbon tax in exchange for his support of Trump. The viral tech blog Gizmodo, in describing Musk as a â€œtycoon using his influence to innovate towards a   future powered by clean energy and complete with human cities on Marsâ€ ran an article about how shocking was that a disruptive tech entrepreneur like Musk could support a   fossil fuel leader like Tillerson, who once described the concept of fully electric vehicles as a daunting pipe dream. Musk is one of the few Silicon Valley tech CEOs who normally avoids commenting on most political issues. That may be due to his masterful ability to amass of $13. 2 billion net worth, despite almost never actually making a profit in the companies that he operates. Arguably, Muskâ€™s comparative business advantage over other CEOs has been his unrivaled ability to convince federal, state and local Democrat and Republican elected officials to provide a dizzying array of almost $5 billion in taxpayer subsidies so that Musk can pursue his adventures in space travel, solar panels and electric cars. Musk is fully aware that Tillerson is no neophyte rube in the technological and political controversies swirling around Climate Change. The Rockefeller Family Fund, formerly the dominant ExxonMobil shareholder, announced last year it would divest from fossil fuels and claimed that Exxon was misleading investors about the risks of climate change. Shortly thereafter, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that ExxonMobil was required to allow shareholders to vote on a climate change resolution. Silicon Valley, also referred to as the Valley of the Democrats, seemed stunned that Musk would respond positively to Tillerson. But Musk told to Bloomberg Techâ€™s Dana Hull that â€œRex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA. â€ Musk added that was a good reason to give Tillerson the â€œbenefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise. â€ Musk, who once said Trump was â€œnot the right guyâ€ to be president of the United States, quickly triangulated after Trumpâ€™s election triumph to having himself named to the new presidentâ€™s business advisory team. He was also one of the 13 tech executives  â€”   along with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Alphabet CEO Larry Page  â€”   to attend Trumpâ€™s   forum at Trump Tower in  . With the Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for January 26 showing that President Trump has caught former President Obama at a 59% approval rating with likely U. S. voters, other Silicon Valley CEOs may find it in their business interest to join Musk in flouting the Silicon Valley political orthodoxy.", "output": "1. True"}

In a complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the groups are seeking an investigation of claims that OneWest Bank violated the Fair Housing Act through â€œredliningâ€ practices such as failing to locate bank branches in black and Latino communities and extending very few or no mortgage loans to borrowers of color. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood film financier who is under consideration for the Treasury post, was not mentioned in the complaint, submitted on Wednesday by the California Reinvestment Coalition and Fair Housing Advocates of Northern California. But their allegations against a bank that was Southern Californiaâ€™s largest during Mnuchinâ€™s ownership could fuel attacks from Senate Democrats if he is nominated to lead the Treasury, which is charged with safeguarding and regulating the U.S. financial system.  Mnuchin could not immediately be reached for comment through his office at Dune Capital Management, the New York-based hedge fund that he leads. Earlier on Thursday, he was seen entering Trump Tower in New York, where Trumpâ€™s transition team is meeting.  The submission is the latest in the two housing groupsâ€™ long-running campaign against OneWest, which also included complaining about its foreclosure practices and opposing its sale by a Mnuchin-led investor group to CIT Group Inc for $3.4 billion last year. The complaint to HUD alleges that OneWest originated just two mortgages to African American customers in the bankâ€™s assessment area. It also maintained and marketed bank-owned homes in predominantly white neighborhoods better than in neighborhoods of color. CIT said in a statement: â€œCIT is committed to fair lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve.â€ Kevin Stein, deputy director of the California Reinvestment Coalition, insisted that the housing groups had long planned to file the complaint this week and the timing was not influenced by Mnuchinâ€™s emergence as a candidate for Treasury. Mnuchin in 2009 led a group that acquired assets of failed mortgage lender IndyMac Bank for $1.55 billion from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, a deal that included a loss-sharing agreement on failed mortgages.  Rebranded as OneWest, it subsequently grew to have 73 branches and $23 billion in assets at the time the CIT deal was announced in 2014.", "output": "1. True"}

He added, â€œWe must never repeat the horrors of war again. â€ For his part, Mr. Obama described in detail what occurred on the day of the attack, highlighted acts of heroism by American service members and said that the visit of Mr. Abe â€œreminds us of what is possible between nations and between peoples. â€™â€™ Mr. Obama added, in what seemed a warning after the scorching American presidential campaign: â€œEven when hatred burns hottest and the tug of tribalism is at the most primal, we must resist the urge to turn in. We must resist the urge to demonize those who are different. The sacrifice made here, the angst of war, reminds us to seek the divine spark that is common to all humanity. â€ The president and prime minister made their remarks at the end of a long pier that overlooks Pearl Harbor and the memorial to the attack  â€”   a small building on top of the carcass of the battleship Arizona in Pearl Harbor, where 2, 400 American sailors, Marines and others were killed in the surprise military strike on Dec. 7, 1941. Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama laid wreaths made of white peace lilies at the memorial, and then dropped purple Hawaiian orchids into the water. The war that began here ended with the United States dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. But out of the ashes of war, the two countries forged one of the most enduring partnerships of the past century, demonstrating that bitter enemies can make peace and become allies. Mr. Abe thanked the United States for helping to rebuild Japan after the attacks. â€œUnder the leadership of the United States, Japan, as a member of the free world, was able to enjoy peace and prosperity,â€ Mr. Abe said. â€œThe good will and assistance you extended to us Japanese, the enemy you had fought so fiercely, together with the tremendous spirit of tolerance, were etched deeply into the hearts and minds of our grandfathers and mothers. â€ The ceremony was another chapter in the reconciliation between the countries and mirrored a similar event in May, when Mr. Obama visited the peace memorial in Hiroshima. In a speech there, Mr. Obama did not apologize for the dropping of the bombs but vowed to continue to work toward ridding the world of nuclear weapons  â€”   a message greeted warmly in Japan, the only country to suffer such an attack. â€œ  years ago, on a bright cloudless morning, death fell from the sky and the world was changed,â€ Mr. Obama said at the time. â€œTechnological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us,â€ Mr. Obama said, adding that such technology â€œrequires a moral revolution as well. â€ The Japanese have long had difficulty making sense of their countryâ€™s decisions during World War II. Some have rationalized the attack on Pearl Harbor as a necessary response to an   embargo that was destroying Japanâ€™s economy. In the 1950s, three Japanese prime ministers â€”   including Mr. Abeâ€™s grandfather Nobusuke Kishi  â€”   visited Honolulu, although there is no record that they participated in a memorial ceremony at Pearl Harbor. In the decades that followed, senior Japanese leaders largely avoided the site. When Emperor Akihito planned to visit the memorial in 1994, nationalist protests in Japan led to his canceling the visit. But six months after Mr. Obama visited Hiroshima, Mr. Abe told the president in a meeting at an economic forum in Peru that he wanted to visit Pearl Harbor. In a statement earlier this month, the White House said that â€œthe meeting will be an opportunity for the two leaders to review our joint efforts over the past four years to strengthen the U. S.  alliance, including our close cooperation on a number of security, economic, and global challenges. â€ The Japanese, who are increasingly alarmed about the rise of China, have largely embraced the visit, as many see it as a way to strengthen ties with the United States. In Japan, NHK, the public broadcaster, played the speeches live, but otherwise, early media coverage of the speeches was muted. There have been suggestions in the Japanese news media that Mr. Abeâ€™s approval ratings will rise in the days after the ceremony, strengthening his hand as he decides whether to call an election in January. Mr. Abe has made closer ties with the United States a central part of his foreign policy, at least under Mr. Obama.   Donald J. Trump has struck a far more hawkish tone toward Japan. During Mr. Obamaâ€™s visit to Hiroshima, Mr. Trump, at that time the presumptive Republican nominee, said on Twitter: â€œDoes President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while heâ€™s in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. â€ Mr. Trump has also criticized the Japanese for being too reliant on the United States for their countryâ€™s defense and for not paying enough for that protection. And Mr. Trump suggested that Japan would be better off if it had nuclear weapons. Mr. Abe met with Mr. Trump in November at Trump Tower, in a meeting that Mr. Abeâ€™s aides said left him feeling optimistic about the prospects of Japanâ€™s relationship with the United States. But the Japanese remain deeply unnerved about Mr. Trump as they view his statements and the suggestion that Japan should acquire its own nuclear arsenal as undermining its strategic alliance with the United States and antithetical to the countryâ€™s pacifist Constitution. Before Mr. Obama and Mr. Abe visited Pearl Harbor, they had a formal meeting at Marines Corps Camp H. M. Smith, where they discussed a wide range of issues, including trade. The dayâ€™s events interrupted Mr. Obamaâ€™s vacation. Since becoming president, he has spent every Christmas in his native Hawaii. He arrived here 10 days ago and has spent his time golfing and seeing friends. On Christmas Day, he and his wife, Michelle Obama, visited troops stationed here. He is expected to be in Hawaii through the New Year. The day marked what is likely Mr. Obamaâ€™s last meeting with a foreign leader as president, as there are just 24 days left before Mr. Trump is to be sworn in.", "output": "1. True"}

Clayton, a partner at elite law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, is expected to win confirmation easily, although some Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee raised concerns about his ties to Wall Street and Goldman Sachs, a bank he represented during the financial crisis and that employs his wife, Gretchen.  His wife plans to resign from the bank if Clayton is confirmed, and he said he will recuse himself from matters involving his or the firmâ€™s clients for two years. Some clients have included Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Bill Ackmanâ€™s hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management and former Ocwen Financial Corp Executive Chairman William Erbey. Clayton told the panel his Wall Street legal experience is a â€œstrength,â€ adding he did not think conflicts of interest would present problems in leading the agency that enforces securities laws and regulates U.S. stock, options and bond markets. â€œAs far as the extent of my practice and whether the recusals that would be required for potential conflicts will impair my ability to act as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, I do not believe they will do so,â€ he said. Clayton, a political independent, told the committee the Dodd-Frank financial reform law should be â€œlooked atâ€ to determine if it has achieved its goals. When pressed on certain parts of the law, such as whether the SEC should delay implementing a rule requiring companies to disclose the ratio of CEO pay to the median pay of workers, Clayton declined to wade into the debate until he could get more information from SEC staff. In their questioning, Republicans led by panel chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho said the SEC should help make it easier for companies to raise money, a goal the Trump administration has embraced. Clayton said that SEC regulations should be clear and lean, saying complexity creates confusion. Companies are taking longer to go public and compliance costs are a deterrent, he said, but he did not offer policy solutions to the problem. Throughout the hearing, Democrats including Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, repeatedly said Claytonâ€™s Wall Street relationships are a worry. â€œIn todayâ€™s confirmation hearing for Jay Clayton, the matter of conflicts of interests was the skunk at the party,â€ said Lisa Gilbert, a vice president of legislative affairs for Public Citizen, which has criticized Claytonâ€™s Wall Street ties. Claytonâ€™s potential recusals could be significant because the commission currently only has two sitting members: Democrat Kara Stein and Republican Michael Piwowar. If Clayton recuses himself and the remaining two disagree, any measure before the commission would fail. He stressed he did not see this as a major concern because most enforcement votes are â€œunanimous.â€ Clayton also said he strongly believes in holding individuals accountable for wrongdoing, adding it could be a greater deterrent than coming down on corporations. The SEC only has civil jurisdiction and cannot bring criminal prosecutions. Democrats also questioned if Clayton is willing to stand up to Trump and his appointees. Warren pointed to billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who is advising Trump on regulation, and asked Clayton about Icahn using his high-profile role to boost his own investments. Icahn has a controlling stake in a refinery that could benefit from a change he has proposed to the U.S. biofuels program and a 24.57 percent stake in Herbalife Ltd, which is under investigation for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Clayton acknowledged he met with Icahn after he was nominated to discuss the role of activist investors, but was careful not to judge Icahnâ€™s roles as investor and White House adviser. Violations of insider trading laws generally entail a â€œfacts and circumstances analysis,â€ he said. Current and former SEC staff have told Reuters they are confident that Clayton will make a strong SEC chairman. Former Republican SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher, who has known Clayton since the financial crisis, attended the hearing Thursday and gave him high marks. â€œHis demeanor is perfectly fitting for an SEC chairman,â€ he said.", "output": "1.

The killer turned out to be homegrown, a    Briton, Khalid Masood, who had a criminal record but was not on any   lists. The Islamic State, which rejects peace and coexistence, described Mr. Masood on Thursday as a disciple and a hero for the assault carried out a day earlier in the shadow of Big Ben. Mr. Masood plowed a rented Hyundai sport utility vehicle through pedestrians on the Westminster Bridge, killing two and injuring at least 40 crashed the vehicle into a fence and then emerged brandishing knives to fatally stab the constable before other police officers shot and killed him. On Thursday evening, another seriously injured victim died, bringing the total number of dead to five, including Mr. Masood. Details about Mr. Masood emerged on Thursday as the government worked to project normalcy and calm nerves. The authorities emphasized that they thought the assailant had acted alone, and that they did not expect any further attacks. But they raided six properties across the country, detaining eight people in London and Birmingham. â€œYesterday, an act of terrorism tried to silence our democracy,â€ Prime Minister Theresa May told Parliament, addressing colleagues who a day earlier had been placed on lockdown for hours. â€œWe are not afraid, and our resolve will never waver in the face of terrorism. â€ She called the violence â€œan attack on free people everywhere. â€ At the United Nations, where the Security Council observed a minute of silence, Britainâ€™s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said, â€œThe world is united to defeat the people who launched this attack and to defeat their bankrupt and odious ideology. â€ Even as the British capital returned to its daily rhythms, and as Parliament resumed business, police officers were trying to learn whether they had missed signs of Mr. Masoodâ€™s radicalization. He was born on Dec. 25, 1964, in Kent, in southeastern England, and had recently lived near Birmingham, historically known for its automotive industry and now home to many South Asian and Caribbean immigrants and their children. It was there, in the Spring Hill neighborhood, that Mr. Masood rented from an Enterprise branch the Hyundai Tucson that he used in the attack. Mr. Masood had a record of convictions, from 1983 to 2003, for assault, weapons possession and violations of public order. But he was not the subject of any current investigation, and â€œthere was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack,â€ the London police said. Birmingham has a history of connections with radicalism. It was home to Rashid Rauf, a liaison to Al Qaeda and a main suspect in a plot to blow up   airliners in 2006 he was killed in 2008 in an American airstrike in northern Pakistan. Last year, security services foiled a bomb plot in Birmingham, linked to extremists. The Home Office made support for the Islamic State a criminal offense in June 2014, when Mrs. May was home secretary, and experts on radicalism said that the change had driven many extremists underground. On Thursday morning, the Islamic State issued a statement on the messaging app Telegram, calling the attacker a soldier who had â€œcarried out the operation in response to appealsâ€ to fight Western powers involved in military operations in the Middle East. The group has called for attacks on Britain, and Mr. Masoodâ€™s assault was reminiscent of attacks in France and Germany carried out with vehicles. A man tried to drive into a crowd in Antwerp, Belgium, on Thursday but was stopped. Mrs. May visited victims at a hospital in London for 40 minutes on Thursday, according to her office. Details about most have not been released, but some information has dribbled out. Police Constable Keith Palmer, 48, a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, was patrolling the Parliament building when the assailant fatally stabbed him. Tributes for Constable Palmer have poured in, and the Metropolitan Police announced on Twitter that his badge number would be retired. â€œKeith Palmer was killed while bravely doing his duty  â€”   protecting our city and the heart of our democracy from those who want to destroy our way of life,â€ Londonâ€™s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said. Kurt W. Cochran, an American traveling in Europe with his wife, Melissa Payne Cochran, died of injuries, according to a statement from the family issued through the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints in Salt Lake City. Clint Payne, Mr. Cochranâ€™s    said in the statement that the couple had been traveling in Europe for their 25th wedding anniversary, and had been scheduled to fly home on Thursday. He called Mr. Cochran â€œa good man and a loving husband. â€ Mr. Cochranâ€™s wife was wounded in the attack, and hospitalized with â€œa broken leg, a broken rib and a cut on her head,â€ her sister, Sarah   said in a post on Facebook. Their parents were serving as missionaries in London, according to the church. The couple ran a recording studio in West Bountiful, Utah, and Mr. Cochran had shared pictures of their stops in Germany and Scotland. Aysha Frade, 43, a British teacher who lived in London, was fatally injured as she was heading to pick up her two daughters. She taught Spanish not far from Westminster Bridge, according to the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia, and she had family in Spain, according to the Spanish Foreign Ministry. The injured also included three   boys from the Brittany region of France who were on the bridge with other visiting students and who sustained leg and arm fractures. On Thursday, the French Education Ministry said that their conditions were no longer  . Five South Koreans were wounded when they were mobbed by a crowd fleeing the attack site, according to the South Korean Foreign Ministry. Four of them  â€”   three women and a man in their 50s and 60s  â€”   suffered fractures and other injuries. A    woman, however, required surgery for a head injury, according to South Korean news reports. The two Romanian victims, Andreea Cristea, 31, and Andrei Burnaz, 32, were from the Black Sea port city of Constanta, according to the Romanian news agency Mediafax, which quoted an official saying they had been visiting London to celebrate Mr. Burnazâ€™s birthday. Ms. Cristea was rescued after she plunged off the bridge into the Thames as the assailant careened the S. U. V. through the crowd, and news reports said she suffered serious head injuries and lung damage. Mr. Burnazâ€™s foot was fractured. An area outside Parliament remained a large crime scene on Thursday, as police officers examined the pavement stones for clues. The Palace of Westminster, which includes the Houses of Parliament, is a bewildering warren of corridors, and the work of ensuring that it was clear of assailants took time in the immediate aftermath of the assault. A group of visiting schoolchildren  â€”   some in tears  â€”   were among those caught up in the confusion, which lasted for hours. Lawmakers were confined to specific areas, where they were given water and in some cases sandwiches. But what some lacked most of all was the power to communicate, and to check that their staff was safe. Over all, the atmosphere was one of calm and cooperation, however. â€œPeople appreciated the gravity of the situation,â€ said Nigel Evans, a Conservative lawmaker. That may have been partly because an attack of this type had not been completely unexpected. Security has been noticeably tightened in Parliament in recent years, with large barriers placed in front of parts of the building to thwart the threat of a truck bomb. Police officers with submachine guns patrol the grounds routinely. But the complex is by a busy street, and some lawmakers still wonder whether some of the security was designed with the idea of fending off the type of attacks once mounted by the Irish Republican Army, which in 1979 assassinated a Conservative lawmaker, Airey Neave, using a car bomb in Parliament. â€œI am shocked, but I am not surprised,â€ Chris Bryant, a Labour lawmaker, said of the latest attack. â€œWe have always known that a marauding attack by an individual would be the most difficult to prevent. â€ On Thursday, with tightened security, lawmakers crowded into the parliamentary chamber determined to show that they would not be deterred. Ed Miliband, a former leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the mood had been one of â€œshock and determination and also admiration for the job that the security people are doing. â€ â€œI think we are seeing peopleâ€™s increased determination to carry on with their normal business,â€ he said.", "output": "1.

In response, President Obama and members of Congress demanded that military officials more aggressively address the threat and its causes. Yet few military experts went as far as Donald J. Trump did Wednesday, when he suggested that the integration of women into the armed forces was an underlying cause of sexual assault. Speaking at a candidatesâ€™ forum, Mr. Trump defended one of his Twitter posts from 2013 concerning the high number of sexual assaults in the military, and said that he had been â€œabsolutely correctâ€ in posting a message that said, â€œWhat did these geniuses expect when they put men  women together?â€ The remarks drew criticism on Thursday from lawmakers and military experts, who said Mr. Trump had displayed ignorance of the Pentagonâ€™s   struggle to curb such assaults and the military justice system that is in place to prosecute them. â€œThatâ€™s more than victim blaming, and it misunderstands the historical role of women in the military,â€ said retired Col. Don Christensen, a former chief prosecutor of the Air Force. American women in the military have taken on expanded roles in recent years as the Pentagon has integrated them into more combat positions. But they have worked alongside servicemen since the Revolutionary War, and in significant numbers since World War II, something Mr. Trump did not acknowledge. Their roles have grown over the centuries from nurses, cooks and seamstresses, who maintained the camps of the Continental Army, to fighter pilots, soldiers, sailors and Marines who are battling the Islamic State in the Middle East and Afghanistan. â€œWe couldnâ€™t run a military without women,â€ said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He noted that an argument that the proximity of women was to blame for sexual assault could be applied to women on college campuses and in workplaces, where they are also assaulted. â€œQuite frankly, itâ€™s absurd,â€ he said. As the Pentagon has released more detailed records on the problem, the statistics reveal that sexual assault in the military is not just a problem faced by women. In 2014, the latest numbers available, the Pentagon estimated that 20, 300 servicemen and servicewomen were assaulted that year. â€œOver half the victims are men,â€ said Colonel Christensen, who is now the president of Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group. Of the estimated 20, 300 attacks in 2014 recorded by the Pentagon, roughly 10, 600 of the victims were men, though women faced a higher rate of assault given their lower overall numbers in the armed forces. Mr. Trumpâ€™s proposed solution of creating a military justice system to deal with sexual assault also puzzled national security experts. A military justice system has been in place in some form since the 1774 British Articles of War. It is an essential and distinct part of the military. â€œGeorge Washington beat him to it!â€ said Mr. Graham, who has worked as a military lawyer. That system and its laws, known as the Uniform Code of Military Justice, have in fact been at the center of a protracted battle in Congress over its role in adjudicating such crimes. One solution was first proposed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York. She has pressed for a measure, opposed by top Pentagon leaders, that would take sexual assault cases outside the military chain of command and give military prosecutors the power to decide which cases to try, rather than keeping that authority with the accuserâ€™s own commander, as is the policy now. Ms. Gillibrandâ€™s logic  â€”   and that of her supporters, including a number of victimsâ€™ groups  â€”   is that more men and women in the military would come forward to report crimes if they did not fear retaliation by those supervising them. The Pentagonâ€™s newest statistics also showed that a majority of victims did not report attacks. The Defense Department said that in 2014, only 6, 131  â€”   under    â€”   of attacks were reported. The 2014 statistics, which were based on a study conducted for the Pentagon by the RAND Corporation, a think tank, found that 62 percent of women who reported sexual assault said they had faced retaliation for doing so. The study, released in May 2015 and endorsed by the Pentagon, offered no comparable statistic for men. Ms. Gillibrandâ€™s efforts have been rebuffed in favor of more modest measures, including those written by Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, that stripped commanders of their ability to overturn jury verdicts and mandated dishonorable discharge or dismissal for anyone convicted of sexual assault. Other recent legislation guarantees that every sexual assault victim in the military receives an independent lawyer, known as a special victimsâ€™ counsel, and assures a civilian review of any case in which a commander overrules a prosecutor seeking to   an accused offender. â€œDonald Trump displayed a stunning lack of knowledge about how the military justice system works, the nature of sexual assault in the military or the dozens of systemic reforms that Congress has made to curb such crimes,â€ Ms. McCaskill said on Thursday. Mr. Trump, pressed on Wednesday about whether his 2013 Twitter post was meant to suggest that women should not serve, said the solution was â€œnot to kick them out. â€ â€œRight now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted,â€ he said. â€œYou have the report of rape, and nobody gets prosecuted. â€ Mr. Trumpâ€™s remarks on sexual assault in the military, like so many he has made on other topics, became instant campaign fodder. Matt Heinz, who is challenging Representative Martha E. McSally, Republican of Arizona and a former Air Force combat pilot, issued a news release on Thursday morning that said, â€œVoters deserve to know if McSally will stick to her principles and denounce Donald Trump and his campaign. â€", "output": "1.

Throughout the week, South Korean officials have warned the North could launch another intercontinental ballistic missile, in defiance of U.N. sanctions and amid an escalating standoff with the United States. Pyongyang marks its founding anniversary each year with a big display of pageantry and military hardware. Last year, North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test on the Sept. 9 anniversary. Tension on the Korean peninsula has escalated as North Korea s young leader, Kim Jong Un, has stepped up the development of weapons, testing a string of missiles this year, including one flying over Japan, and conducting its sixth nuclear test on Sunday. Experts believe the isolated regime is close to its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States, something U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to prevent. Celebrating its founding anniversary, a front-page editorial of the Saturday edition of North Korea s official Rodong Sinmun said the country should make  more high-tech Juche weapons to continuously bring about big historical events such as a miraculous victory of July 28. . The July date refers to the intercontinental ballistic missile test.  Juche is North Korea s homegrown ideology of self-reliance that is a mix of Marxism and extreme nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il Sung, the current leader s grandfather.      South Korean nuclear experts, checking for contamination, said on Friday they had found minute traces of radioactive xenon gas but that it was too early to link it to Sunday s explosion. The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission (NSSC) said it had been conducting tests on land, air and water samples since shortly after the North Korean nuclear test on Sunday. Xenon is a naturally occurring, colourless gas that is used in manufacturing of some sorts of lights. But the NSSC said it had detected xenon-133, a radioactive isotope that does not occur naturally and which has in the past been linked to North Korea s nuclear tests. There was no chance the xenon  will have an impact on South Korea s territory or population , the agency said. Trump has repeatedly said all options are on the table in dealing with North Korea and on Thursday said he would prefer not to use military action, but if he did, it would be a  very sad day  for North Korea.  Military action would certainly be an option. Is it inevitable? Nothing is inevitable,  Trump told reporters.  If we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea.  Even as Trump has insisted that now is not the time to talk, senior members of his administration have made clear that the door to a diplomatic solution is open, especially given the U.S. assessment that any pre-emptive strike would unleash massive North Korean retaliation. North Korea says it needs its weapons to protect itself from U.S. aggression and regularly threatens to destroy the United States.  South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. The USS Ronald Reagan, a nuclear-powered carrier, left its home port in Japan for a routine autumn patrol of the Western Pacific, a Navy spokeswoman said. That area included waters between Japan and the Korean peninsula, she added, without giving any further details.  The Ronald Reagan was out on routine patrol from May until August, and was sent to the Sea of Japan with the another carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, to take part in drills with Japan s Self Defense Forces as well as the South Korean military.  North Korea vehemently objects to military exercises on or near the peninsula, and China and Russia have suggested the United States and South Korea halt their exercises to lower tension. While Trump talked tough on North Korea, China agreed on Thursday that the United Nations should take more action against it, but it also pushed for dialogue. The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote on a new set of sanctions soon. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that it was too early to draw conclusions about the final form of the U.N. resolution, Russia s Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying at a news conference on Friday. The United States on Friday told the U.N. Security Council that it intends to call a meeting on Monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on North Korea for its missile and nuclear program, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations said in a statement. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said last Monday that she intended to call for a vote on Sept. 11 and then the United States circulated a draft resolution to the 15-member council on Wednesday. The United States wants the Security Council to impose an oil embargo on North Korea, ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of North Korean laborers abroad, and to subject Kim Jong Un to an asset freeze and travel ban, according to a draft resolution seen by Reuters on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear how North Korean allies China and Russia would vote, but a senior U.S. official on Friday night expressed scepticism that either nation would accept anything more stringent than a ban on imports of North Korean textiles. Chinese officials have privately expressed fears that imposing an oil embargo could risk triggering massive instability in its neighbor.  North Korea offered fresh vitriol against the pending sanctions, specifically targeting Haley, who this week accused Kim of  begging for war .  There is nothing more foolish than thinking we, a strong nuclear state, will endure this evil pressure aimed at overthrowing our state,  the North s official news agency said in a commentary.  Even if Nikki Haley is blind, she must use her mouth correctly. The United States administration will pay for not being able to control the mouth of their U.N. representative.  China is by far North Korea s biggest trading partner, accounting for 92 percent of two-way trade last year. It also provides hundreds of thousands of tonnes of oil and fuel to the impoverished regime.   China s economic influence has been felt by South Korea as well. The two countries have been at loggerheads over South Korea s decision to deploy a U.S. anti-missile system, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, which has a powerful radar that can probe deep into China. Shares in South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor (005380.KS) and key suppliers slid on Friday on worries over its position in China after highly critical Chinese state newspaper comments.

By a vote of 326-96, the House passed the legislation that is now before the Senate where it has encountered opposition from Democrats who are upset over the refusal by Republicans to include a long-term extension of expiring healthcare benefits for retired coal miners and their families. Instead, the bill would continue the benefits only until next April. â€œIâ€™ve never seen anything this callous in my life,â€ said West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. As a result, the Senate might not be able to vote on the spending bill until sometime this weekend, technically putting the U.S. government into a partial shutdown mode on Saturday. Flint, Michigan, which has endured a two-and-a-half-year struggle with lead-contaminated drinking water, would get access to a $170 million fund for infrastructure improvements and lead poisoning prevention under the bill. The stop-gap funding bill reflects the inability of the Republican-controlled Congress to pass the dozen regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 and runs through Sept. 30, 2017, freezing most spending at current levels. Congress was unable to pass them in part because of internal disagreements among Republicans on some of those measures and because Democrats held firm to an earlier budget deal that aims to restrain spending caps on defense as long as those caps were imposed on other domestic programs.          Congress likely will end up arguing well into 2017 over spending priorities for the current fiscal year even as it must begin considering funding government operations in fiscal 2018. Congressâ€™ delay in finishing its work also means that President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, will have some say in government spending priorities for the period of April 28-Sept. 30, instead of President Barack Obama. A provision is also embedded in the spending bill to make it easier for Trump to win confirmation of General James Mattis to be defense secretary early next year. Republicans demanded it to help Mattis get around a requirement that the defense secretary be a civilian for seven years before taking the job. Mattis retired from the military in 2013.

Judge Reed Oâ€™Connor of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas said in a   ruling, which he said should apply nationwide, that the government had not complied with federal law when it issued â€œdirectives which contradict the existing legislative and regulatory text. â€ Judge Oâ€™Connor, whom President George W. Bush nominated to the federal bench, said that not granting an injunction would put states â€œin the position of either maintaining their current policies in the face of the federal governmentâ€™s view that they are violating the law, or changing them to comply with the guidelines and cede their authority over this issue. â€ The judgeâ€™s order on Sunday, in a case brought by officials from more than a dozen states, was a victory for social conservatives in the continuing legal battles over the restroom guidelines, which the federal government issued this year. The culture war over the rights of transgender people, and especially their right to use public bathrooms consistent with their gender identities, has emerged as an emotional cause among social conservatives. The Obama administrationâ€™s assertion that the rights of transgender people in public schools and workplaces are protected under existing laws against sex discrimination has been condemned by social conservatives, who said the administration was illegally intruding into local affairs and promoting a policy that would jeopardize the privacy and safety of schoolchildren. The ruling could deter the administration from bringing new legal action against school districts that do not allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. â€œWe are pleased that the court ruled against the Obama administrationâ€™s latest illegal federal overreach,â€ Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas said in a statement on Monday. â€œThis president is attempting to rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people and is threatening to take away federal funding from schools to force them to conform. â€ A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Dena W. Iverson, said the department was disappointed with the decision and was reviewing its options. In a statement, several civil rights organizations that had submitted a brief opposing the injunction called the ruling unfortunate and premature. â€œA ruling by a single judge in one circuit cannot and does not undo the years of clear legal precedent nationwide establishing that transgender students have the right to go to school without being singled out for discrimination,â€ the groups  â€”   Lambda Legal the American Civil Liberties Union and the A. C. L. U. of Texas the National Center for Lesbian Rights the Transgender Law Center and G. L. B. T. Q. Legal Advocates  Defenders  â€”   said in their statement. The ultimate impact of the Texas decision is unclear and is likely to be limited, legal experts said. For one thing, more senior courts in other regions have agreed with the administration that transgender students and workers are protected by existing laws against sex discrimination, and their decisions will not be altered by the Texas ruling. Also, the decision will not necessarily affect the outcome of other current cases. In the most prominent one, a federal court in North Carolina is weighing almost identical issues in suits brought by civil rights groups and the Justice Department that seek to block a state law requiring people in government buildings, including public schools, to use bathrooms that correspond to the gender on their birth certificates. Adding another major note of uncertainty, the United States Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a decision by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that required a school district in Virginia to allow a transgender boy to use the boysâ€™ bathrooms. The Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction until it decides, probably this fall, whether to hear the case. If the Supreme Court does take the case and reaches a majority decision one way or another, then existing rulings by district and appeals courts could be superseded. If the Supreme Court takes the Virginia case but then is divided, four to four, on the issues, the Fourth Circuitâ€™s existing decision in favor of transgender rights would take effect, although it would not be a nationally binding precedent. The Texas lawsuit, filed by Mr. Paxton on behalf of officials in 13 states, argued that the Obama administration had overstepped its authority in a series of pronouncements in recent years holding that discrimination against transgender people is a violation of existing laws against sex discrimination, including Title IX in federal education laws and Title VII in federal civil rights laws governing the workplace. In May, in the latest such statement, the federal Justice and Education Departments issued a letter to public schools stating that transgender people should be free to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities, and that schools that refused could lose federal funds. â€œA school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use   facilities when other students are not required to do so,â€ the letter stated. The letter was quickly condemned by social conservatives, leading numerous state governments and school districts around the country to file lawsuits seeking to prevent the administration from taking action. The Obama administration, seeking to deflect the Texas lawsuit and another brought by 10 other states, argued that the directive was not a regulation or mandate but rather an explanation of how the administration interpreted existing   protections. But it carried a threat that the administration might sue noncompliant school districts and seek to cut off vital federal education aid. The states argued not only that the administration was wrong as a matter of law, but also that it had failed to follow legal procedures for issuing what the states called a â€œnew mandateâ€ that â€œharms school districts from coast to coast by usurping lawful authorityâ€ and jeopardizing â€œbillions of dollars in federal funding. â€ The Justice Department countered that the case was not suitable for litigation because the states had not shown evidence that they faced imminent harm, let alone a likelihood of success on the merits. If the administration brought action against school districts, the government and groups supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights argued, the school districts or states could make their case in court. â€œThere is a multistep procedure before a state might lose federal funding,â€ said Jon W. Davidson, the legal director of Lambda Legal. â€œThe government would have to specifically challenge a state, the state could respond, the government could bring a lawsuit, and then litigation in the courts would decide whether the governmentâ€™s interpretation of the law is correct or not. â€", "output": "1.

[In the prepared remarks, Comey confirms that he told Trump he was not under FBI investigation multiple times, as Trump has asserted.  Comey said he told the president on January 6, January 27, and on March 30 that he was not under investigation. They also show that Trump had never pressured Comey to drop the FBIâ€™s investigation of whether there was any collusion between his campaign and Russia. In fact, according to Comey, Trump had said it would be â€œgoodâ€ to find out of there were some â€œsatelliteâ€ associates of his who did something wrong. In his remarks, Comey clarified conversations with Trump that his â€œassociatesâ€ relayed to the media  â€”   which showed Trump never â€œdemandedâ€ loyalty or â€œpressuredâ€ him to drop any investigation on Flynn or the broader Russia. According to a May 11 New York Times report, Trump had told Comey he â€œneeded his loyalty. â€ The headline read, â€œIn a Private Dinner, Trump Demanded Loyalty. Comey Demurred. â€ However, according to Comeyâ€™s account, Trump never asked Comey to pledge his loyalty, and Comey never refused, as the Times reported. Trump had, according to the account, said, â€œI need loyalty. I expect loyalty. â€ Comey said he did not respond to the comment. Later in the conversation, he said Trump said again, â€œI need loyalty,â€ and that he responded, â€œYou will always get honesty from me. â€ He said the president then said, â€œThatâ€™s what I want, honest loyalty,â€ to which Comey said, â€œYou will get that from me. â€ Comey said he was not sure what the president meant, and he did not ask, leaving it unclear as to what Trump actually wanted from him and what he meant by â€œloyalty,â€ and in what context. As the Times also noted in the report, â€œThroughout his career, Mr. Trump has made loyalty from the people who work for him a key priority, often discharging employees he considers insufficiently reliable. â€ Comey also provided more context to a conversation he had with Trump on February 14, in which the president reportedly asked him to drop the FBI investigation on his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, whom he had dismissed the day before. The Washington Post ran an article on May 16 that was headlined, â€œNotes made by FBI Director Comey say Trump pressured him to end Flynn probe. â€ However, Comeyâ€™s account makes it far from clear that he was ever â€œpressured. â€ Comey said the president said, â€œI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. â€ Comey said the president then turned to the subject of leaks. Comey did not say whether he responded to the presidentâ€™s comment, which he characterized as a â€œrequest. â€ A White House statement at the time said, â€œthe president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end an investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn. â€ Comey also clarified that he understood the presidentâ€™s comment as a request that any investigation of Flynn be dropped  â€”   but not â€œthe broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. â€ The former FBI director also addressed why he did not tell anyone outside of senior FBI leadership about the Presidentâ€™s comment. He said he did not pass on that information to others in the FBI because he didnâ€™t want to â€œinfectâ€ the investigative team, and because he did not intend to abide by the request. He also said he had nothing to corroborate his story (which he still does not) and that he didnâ€™t tell Attorney General Jeff Sessions because Sessions was expected to recuse himself from the investigation. They also decided not to tell the deputy attorney general, who would not long be there in that role. â€œAfter discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed,â€ he said. Comey said the investigation actually â€œmoved ahead at full speed. â€ Comey does not explain why he never told anyone in Congress, including congressional committees that oversee the FBI. He will likely be asked on Thursday why he did not come to Congress. In fact, he told Sen. Mazie Hirono ( ) last month that a situation where the FBI was told to stop something for a political reason has â€œnot happened in my experience. â€ Comey said Trump had called him on March 30 and said the Russia investigation was like â€œa cloudâ€ impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country, and asked what the FBI could do to â€œlift the cloud. â€ Comey said he told him they were investigating the matter as quickly as they could. He said he again told Trump he was not being personally investigated. He said Trump had repeatedly told him, â€œWe need to get that fact out. â€ Comey said he did not tell the president that the FBI and Justice Department were reluctant to do that, since that would create a duty to correct the record if things changed, but that he would â€œsee what we could doâ€ to lift the cloud. â€œI told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could,â€ he said. Comey also said he called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente for guidance, but he never received a call back. Trump would call back two weeks later asking what he had done to make it clear that he was not personally under investigation. Comey said Trump said he would â€œhave his peopleâ€ reach out to Boente, and that he told the President that was the way to go. Comey said Trump said he would do that and added, â€œBecause I have been very loyal to you, very loyal we had that thing you know. â€ But Comey said he wasnâ€™t sure what the President meant. â€œThat was the last time I spoke with President Trump,â€ Comey said.", "output": "1.

Mr. Steeleâ€™s abrupt departure comes at a time of turmoil for the university, as he and other top administrators have been criticized for their handling of a widening sexual harassment scandal. Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for the university, said an interim successor for Mr. Steele would be named in the coming days. In a statement released by the university, Mr. Steele said his wife faced â€œquite significantâ€ health problems and that he needed to spend more time with her. The universityâ€™s chancellor, Nicholas B. Dirks, praised Mr. Steele for his â€œlasting impactâ€ on the university, citing his work in dealing with the universityâ€™s finances and   and â€œimproving the campus climateâ€ with regard to racial diversity. Mr. Steele will remain at Berkeley in a faculty position, joining the psychology department next year, according to the announcement. The statement did not mention the sexual harassment scandal, which has grown in magnitude in recent weeks. Mr. Steele has been criticized for his handling of claims of sexual harassment made against the dean of the law school, Sujit Choudhry. A report by the university found that Mr. Choudhry had repeatedly hugged and kissed his executive assistant, behavior that an investigator concluded was â€œunwelcome and objectively sexual in nature. â€ Mr. Steele allowed Mr. Choudhry to stay on as the dean, but ordered a   cut in his salary and required that he undergo counseling and write a letter of apology to his assistant, who was told to look for work elsewhere at the university. Alumni and students expressed outrage at the terms of the punishment, which became public in March when Mr. Choudhryâ€™s assistant, Tyann Sorrell, filed a civil suit. Prominent alumni of the law school called the punishment â€œfeeble. â€ Court papers filed with the lawsuit say that when Ms. Sorrell questioned why university officials had not taken stronger action against Mr. Choudhry, Mr. Steele told her that he had decided against termination because it â€œwould ruin the deanâ€™s career, that is, destroy his future chances for higher appointment. â€ Mr. Choudhry has since resigned. The university this month released hundreds of pages of investigative reports showing violations of the universityâ€™s sexual harassment policies by 19 university employees. Most of the cases had not previously been made public. In addition to these cases, the university is investigating 16 cases involving sexual harassment and nine involving sexual violence.", "output": "1. True"}

I did not suggest   specifically because I thought Jonah Hill would lose at it, but rather because his initial suggestion for an interview activity  â€”   tennis  â€”   presented logistical complications: specifically, the problem of trying to talk with someone from 70 feet away across a net on a loud city court. So Hill agreed to  . â€œDoesnâ€™t Susan Sarandon have a   place in New York?â€ he mused while forming a plan. â€œIâ€™ve heard that. I know people whoâ€™ve gone there. I donâ€™t really know what Susan Sarandonâ€™s involvement is. I just know for certain that sheâ€™s tangentially connected to the   industry. â€ This turns out to be correct. The Academy   actress Susan Sarandon is a founder of a chain of   lounges called SPiN. It has locations in New York, Toronto, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco. The New York outlet, where I met Hill on a Wednesday afternoon in June, is an icily   subterranean space on 23rd Street with nightmarish wall murals and 18 royal blue tables. Players were scattered about the place, ponging away to a dance remix of â€œLetâ€™s Talk About Sex. â€ Hill arrived punctually with drowsy eyes and an iced coffee from Starbucks. â€œNo sign of Susan Sarandon,â€ he observed, looking around the room and dragging on his coffee, â€œwhich is the biggest sign of Susan Sarandon. â€ He did not, he said, get a lot of sleep last night. There was a work call with someone in a different time zone  â€”   a â€œfinance personâ€ for a movie he plans to direct  â€”   and the conversation left Hill so jazzed that he couldnâ€™t fall asleep, so he took his French bulldog Carmela (named after Tony Sopranoâ€™s wife) for a walk around the neighborhood, and when he finally dozed off he left a window open, leaving him speckled with â€œa thousandâ€ mosquito bites, visible in rosy constellations across his arms. The coffee was helping. Hill, at 32, has appeared in enough movies (currently 29) that he was recognized, in the space of 10 minutes, by a female SPiN employee in her 20s who requested a photo, by a 40ish camp counselor who asked that Hill take a picture with his campers and by the campers themselves, who clustered around the actor and stared stoically into the camera for a photo in which Hill was the only one smiling. These people probably knew Hill from his role as a hilarious sidekick in the â€œ21 Jump Streetâ€ remakes, or from his role as a hilarious sidekick in â€œThe Wolf of Wall Street,â€ or from his role as a hilarious sidekick in â€œSuperbad. â€ The   roles make up a numer ically small but   portion of Hillâ€™s career, and no number of contrasting performances  â€”   in indie comedies directed by the Duplass brothers, in   dramas like â€œMoneyballâ€  â€”   can seem to override the public impression of him as a man who might, at any moment, start humping the furniture. This is fair, because Hill is excellent at delivering coitus jokes. Itâ€™s also unfair, because his acting career didnâ€™t begin in a   place and it doesnâ€™t seem to be heading in that direction, even if his IMDb page is dotted with the presence of Judd Apatow. Hill has received two Oscar nominations and produced six movies and has writing credits on both of the â€œJump Streetâ€ movies. He is not Seth Rogen, although people sometimes confuse the two men, which feels vaguely   given that they look nothing alike. Next year heâ€™ll direct a movie that he wrote (not a comedy). This summer he appears in â€œWar Dogs,â€ directed by Todd Phillips, of the â€œHangoverâ€ movies. Though itâ€™s strewn with giggly moments, the movie is ultimately alarming. Hill plays a sociopathic arms dealer. In the basement at SPiN,   patrons continued to recognize the actor, who didnâ€™t wear a hat or sunglasses or other protective camouflage, until a manager registered the ogling and transferred Hill to a private room behind a   curtain. By now the coffee had kicked in. I asked Hill if he was ready to play  . â€œYeah!â€ he said. â€œI was just thinking that Iâ€™d love to. â€ Pause. â€œYou didnâ€™t think of that idea  â€”   I thought of it. â€ This last sentence came across as a joke in real life  â€”   he was doing an impression of a surreally bratty person  â€”   but it reads horribly on the page, which turns out to be true of many things that Hill says. His humor is  . This may be one reason that profiles of the actor have not historically been ultraflattering. Another reason may be Hillâ€™s face. â€œI have resting bitch face,â€ he explained to me once. â€œI really do. Itâ€™s heartbreaking. I donâ€™t mean anything by it. â€ This is borne out by paparazzi photos of Hill sternly alighting from a vehicle, angrily riding a Citi Bike and resentfully hanging out with Leonardo DiCaprio. â€œI know I look really pissed off,â€ he said, â€œbut Iâ€™m not. â€ If life were a reality TV show, it would be accurate to say that Hill has received a â€œbad edit,â€ in part because of the above factors. In 2013 he did an interview with Rolling Stone that resulted in the following words being used by media outlets to describe him: humorless, insufferable, angry, defensive, pompous jerk, and â€œ20 Most Hated Celebrities!â€ Todayâ€™s Jonah Hill, rallying at a   table, seems like someone who might do yoga, or drink green tea, or practice Transcendental Meditation. Maybe it is just the residue of his youth in California. Maybe â€œcenterednessâ€ is just Los Angeles leaving the body. Whatever it is, he comes off as mellow and polite, keeping his phone out of sight during interactions and asking if I have any dietary restrictions. He behaves in a way that would assure his mother that she did a good job. He says that the trait he values most in others is being nice. Most famous people have a thin oleaginous layer of social grace that tops a bottomless well of impatience to get their press duties over with, but Hill seemed to be in no particular hurry to do anything, except lose at  . While his serve is 90 percent unreturnable and his backhand is evil, Hillâ€™s forehand is unreliable. Midway through Round 1 an employee popped his head in and asked for the score. â€œFourteen to 20,â€ Hill replied. â€œSheâ€™s winning. â€ The guy scoffed. â€œYouâ€™re losing to a girl?â€ â€œThatâ€™s not a very feminist attitude, my friend,â€ Hill said. â€œDoes that make you mad?â€ he asked, after the employee left. â€œItâ€™s not the dumb outlook that bothers me. Itâ€™s that he expects me to share that sentiment. He expects me to be like, â€˜Yeah, Iâ€™m really embarrassed that a girl is beating me. â€™â€™u2009â€ For Round 2, which he also lost, Hill plugged his iPod into a speaker and selected a playlist of   â€™90s rap acts like the Coup and Jeru the Damaja. When the game ended, he briefly howled in grief, bounced over to shake hands and then floated the idea of barbecue for lunch. Not a bad loser. A certain comfort with vulnerability might be the most prominent aspect of Hillâ€™s personality. At lunch, he gets the hiccups. He warns me that his face sweats a lot, but that the rest of his body produces a normal amount of sweat, and he occasionally mops his forehead as politely as anyone can mop anything using a napkin that he has folded into a tidy mopping rectangle. If you compliment his acting, heâ€™ll say, â€œThank you,â€ and then â€œDo you really feel that way?â€  â€”   and not in a â€œDo go onâ€ tone, but as if he suspects a polite fabrication and is offering an out. Once he was asked to audition for a part in a filmed musical adaptation, and he declined  â€”   because he canâ€™t sing, but also because the   possibility of his audition tapeâ€™s being leaked was too embarrassing to contemplate. This hypothetical struck him as even more embarrassing than a leaked sex tape, because after all, he said, â€œmost human beings have had more practice at having sex than they have at singing. â€ Vulnerability is a counterproductive trait for a famous person to have, but Hill is funniest   when he plays characters thumping up against their feeble natures, and he is most affecting in dramatic roles doing the same. It makes you wonder whether the kind of person most suited to being an actor  â€”   sensitive, expressive, slightly weird  â€”   is the kind of person least suited to being a celebrity. Hill has been sensitive and weird since infancy. He grew up in Los Angeles, the son of an accountant and a costume designer, enjoying a childhood that he characterizes as â€œfunâ€ yet â€œsuper emo. â€ He cried frequently. For a year starting at age 4 he pretended to be a dog and padded around the house on all fours, woofing, which may have been his first acting experience. He intended to grow up into a writer until he became obsessed with skateboarding at around 10. His dreams of becoming a professional skater eventually receded because of a lack of skill, and he enrolled in college at The New School with plans to write and direct. â€œIn school I was always a decent athlete, a decent student, but I was never exceptional at any of that stuff,â€ he says. â€œWhen I started taking acting classes, it was the first time teachers were like, â€˜Youâ€™re good and you should keep doing this. â€™â€™u2009â€ Another adult who recognized Hillâ€™s potential was Dustin Hoffman, who happened to be the father of Hillâ€™s former schoolmate Jake Hoffman and who suggested that Hill audition for â€œI Heart Huckabees. â€ Hill got the part and appears halfway through the movie as a   teenager arguing with his sister and playing video games at a family dinner across from Mark Wahlberg. The role is a blip, but Hill earns his few minutes   appearing at ease despite never having been in a movie and having no idea, he told me, when the camera was on him. This confidence apparently stretches back to his youth: A Jewish Journal profile from 2012  â€”   a rare flattering one  â€”   includes a quote from Cantor Yonah Kliger of Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills, where Hill had his bar mitzvah, describing him as â€œdestined for something greatâ€ and â€œelectricâ€ even at 13, reciting his Torah portion in a prayer shawl. Three years after â€œHuckabees,â€ Hill   in â€œSuperbadâ€ as a   who cries, dances, lies, has his heart broken, is struck by a number of vehicles and exchanges tender    with Michael Ceraâ€™s character in a final scene that still makes me weep in a way that no Pixar movie ever will. This was his breakthrough. If â€œSuperbadâ€ cemented Hillâ€™s status as an entertaining accent piece, â€œMoneyballâ€ (2011) suggested that pegging him as a novelty actor was an error. His character in that movie, an economics geek named Peter Brand, is an introvert who walks the earth as if heâ€™s about to be pantsed. He underplays the part so deftly that Brandâ€™s emotional climax  â€”   when he sees that his methods actually work  â€”   is conveyed by no more than a few euphoric seconds of rapid blinking and a  . The next movie he appeared in was a critical disaster of a comedy called â€œThe Sitter. â€ Because of this seesawing, the best way to make sense of Hillâ€™s career is to divide it roughly in half, not chronologically but by the two kinds of movies he makes: on one side, the goofy com edies, and on the other side,   movies by respected directors, like â€œDjango Unchainedâ€ and â€œThe Wolf of Wall Streetâ€ and â€œHail, Caesar!â€ After â€œSuperbad,â€ it would have been easy for Hill to take the Adam Sandler route and ride the wave of his own typecasting, making bad copies of the same movie over and over again. Instead, he exercised discretion in his roles and did a   job to hammer out the kind of career that hilarious sidekicks in   teen com edies have not traditionally enjoyed. (Jason Biggs offers a useful point of comparison it took him a decade and a half to recover from the abasement of â€œAmerican Pie. â€) The parallel movie tracks have one thing in common, which is that Hill tends to play obsessive characters in both. In â€œWar Dogsâ€ he is obsessed with selling weapons to the United States government for piles of money. In â€œTrue Story,â€ he is obsessed with a murderer. In â€œMoneyball,â€ he is obsessed with sabermetrics. In â€œCyrus,â€ heâ€™s obsessed with his mom. In â€œSuperbad,â€ he is obsessed with the probability of losing his best friend. Even in â€œHail, Caesar!â€ though he is onscreen for approximately two seconds, the gag of Hillâ€™s character is that he is too engrossed in processing legal papers to take note of Scarlett Johanssonâ€™s predatory innuendoes. Obsessiveness is a good filter for choosing roles, because there is nothing with more comic potential than a character who desperately wants something, and thereâ€™s also nothing with more tragic potential the distinction is in how that obsession pans out. It can be a poignant trait, as with Jay Gatsby or an evil one, as with Hannibal Lecter or a creepy one, as with Annie Wilkes or a mesmerizing one, as with Willy Wonka or an epic one, as with Charles Foster Kane or a pa thetic one, as with Norma Desmond. Monomania is infinitely versatile. Ellen Lewis, who cast Hill as Donnie Azoff in â€œThe Wolf of Wall Street,â€ had been particularly impressed with his performance in â€œSuperbad. â€ â€œWolfâ€ wasnâ€™t necessarily written to be funny, she said, but Martin Scorsese wanted a Donnie who could improvise. â€œObviously it was a different way to go,â€ she said. â€œJonahâ€™s got depth, but at the same time, heâ€™s extremely charismatic. And really funny people can be very dangerous. He showed that edge. â€ He reminded her a little, Lewis said, of Robin Williams. One thing Iâ€™ve never understood about acting is how famous actors get better at it. Do they all have acting coaches on retainer? And if these acting coaches are so good, why arenâ€™t they famous actors? When someone is freakishly precocious at acting, like Claire Danes, where does that come from? When someone gets appreciably worse at acting, like Al Pacino or Robert De Niro, how does that happen? And when someone gets perceptibly better at acting, like Jonah Hill, how does he make sure that his trajectory continues in a northeastern direction? At lunch he mentioned that every night before filming â€œCyrus,â€ he brushed his lips with a toothbrush because his character seemed like the kind of person who would have permanently chapped lips. How did he learn to think of this stuff, these novelistic details? Hill shrugged at the question. â€œIf it was your job to think of those things, you would. You just would. â€ But whatâ€™s his secret? â€œThe acting juice I drink every morning. â€ But really. â€œI watch things over and over again,â€ Hill said. Like, 20 times. Most recently, â€œBehind the Candelabra. â€ Before that, the French film â€œA Prophet. â€ All the great Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola movies, obviously. All the Paul Thomas Anderson movies. He loves Lena Dunham and Spike Jonze. When he finds a movie he likes, he watches it compulsively  â€”   and at a loud volume, because he has bad hearing from listening to live music as a youth without taking the proper precautions. He watches movies until he is able to forget that he is watching a movie, which to Hill is the sign of a really great movie. He picks the roles he plays using the same rubric he uses to pick the movies that he watches, which is by director. â€œIf you have a great script, itâ€™s hard to [expletive] it up  â€”   but Iâ€™ve kind of had that happen,â€ he said. â€œAnd Iâ€™ve had scripts that were not even complete, and the director was amazing, and I ended up being proud of the movie. â€ Great directors, he maintained, make great movies. It took him a while to figure this out. Even if a role is good, he wonâ€™t do a movie now unless he believes in the director, because â€œYou donâ€™t want to be a cool character in a bad movie. â€ Nobody has bulletproof judgment, though, and Hillâ€™s character in this summerâ€™s â€œWar Dogsâ€ could be seen as a terrific character in an otherwise O. K. movie. Itâ€™s not that â€œWar Dogsâ€ isnâ€™t funny and itâ€™s not as if Todd Phillips has made a   comedy about Ferguson, but it is an Iraq War movie made by the director of â€œThe Hangover. â€ There are strippers and an underwritten   role and Bradley Cooper. Phillips originally approached Hill with the movie a few years ago, offering him either of the two lead roles, but Hill declined, thinking it was somehow too similar to â€œThe Wolf of Wall Street. â€ Phillips kept trying. Hill appreciated the persistence and eventually said yes. He was driving out of the â€œyesâ€ meeting in his car when he spotted Phillips leaving separately on his Vespa. Unaware that Hill was watching, Phillips pulled over to the side of the road and did a victory fist pump, by himself, in a moment of unguarded personal joy. Hill found this immensely endearing. (Philips said he does not recall this event but that he believes it happened: â€œIâ€™ve been known to tool around on my Vespa and Iâ€™ve been known to get excited. â€) â€œItâ€™s funny,â€ Phillips said of Hill, â€œbecause in actual life heâ€™s  â€”   â€˜quietâ€™ is the wrong word, but reserved. If you sit down to lunch with him youâ€™ll laugh, but heâ€™s reserved. When he steps on set, this natural swagger comes out. â€ In the movie, Hill plays Efraim Diveroli, an   bro from Miami Beach with   ambitions and a buttery spray tan. The movie is based on a true story, which originally appeared in Rolling Stone and which Hill himself tried to option before finding out that Phillips had already bought the rights. The real Efraim Diveroli does not approve of the movie, has not spent time with Hill and has filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. The buttery spray tan was applied nightly in Hillâ€™s hotel room by a woman named Felicia, who stood aiming a hose while he pulled his boxers into a thong and revolved. Throughout filming he smelled faintly tropical. To prepare for all his movies, Hill compiles   playlists and then listens to them until they seep into his consciousness. For â€œWar Dogs,â€ the playlist involved â€œa lot of cheesy,   Miami booty bass,â€ which gives you a sense of his characterâ€™s personality: loud, libidinous and whatever the opposite of introspective is. â€œI imagined him listening to music that revved him up to lie to someone,â€ Hill said. â€œA lot of the people with confidence that you play, you try to find their deep insecurity. I donâ€™t think Efraim is a deeply, deeply insecure person. â€ Instead of making the character a cartoon villain, Hillâ€™s Efraim is gleeful and coercive and menacing, with a helmet of gelled hair and a   giggle that sounds like the creepiest ringtone on earth. Miles Teller   in the film but disappears in the role next to Hill, he has the charisma of a corn dog. Hillâ€™s appeal, whatever the genre, is in his instinct to punctuate long stretches of smoothness with florid bloopers. Heâ€™s either fully in control of himself or totally at the mercy of his emotions. He has the fallibility of an Everyman with the magnetism of someone millions of young men and women would halt a   game to take a selfie with. A decade ago we idolized celebrities whom we could never, in a million years, imagine being or dating. Lately we have adjusted our expectations downward to prefer figures, like Hill, who could be described as â€œreasonably aspirational. â€ In person heâ€™s both smooth and   not with cinematic extremity but in a way that makes you think his friends definitely have a lot of Jonah Hill anecdotes in their back pockets. He is a generator of incidents. One morning in June we went for a southbound walk on the High Line. Hill ambled along at a      pace, pausing to buy a $1 amulet reading WORK SMOOTHLY LIFETIME PEACE from a (possibly phony) monk and lingering to form a   audience for a street performer singing Rick Astleyâ€™s â€œNever Gonna Give You Up. â€ â€œI love this song,â€ Hill said, grooving mildly and retrieving a bill from his pocket. There was no visible donation receptacle, so he put the money on the performerâ€™s side table, where it started blowing away in the wind. To prevent this, Hill slid the manâ€™s nearby iPhone onto the bill to act as a paperweight, but his finger tapped â€œpauseâ€ in the process and the Rick Astley instrumental abruptly ceased. â€œIâ€™m sorry!â€ Hill wailed. â€œI completely [expletive] that up. â€ The performer made a â€œno probâ€ gesture and resumed singing, then did a back flip, as if to assure Hill that everything was cool between them. As we walked away Hill spoke directly into my tape recorder, as if to guarantee that the corny Rick Astley joke he was about to make would be reflected accurately for future generations: â€œI want it on the record that he just looked me in the eye and promised me never to hurt me. Itâ€™s documented. If that man ever, ever breaks my heart or deserts me, there will be legal repercussions. â€", "output": "1. True"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall and punishment for cities shielding illegal immigrants while mulling restoring a CIA secret detention program as he launched broad but divisive plans to reshape U.S. immigration and national security policy. A draft executive order seen by Reuters that Trump is expected to sign in the coming days would block the entry of refugees from war-torn Syria and suspend the entry of any immigrants from Muslim-majority Middle Eastern and African countries Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen while permanent rules are studied. Less than a week into his presidency, Trump has moved aggressively to put his stamp on a range of policies, including steps to gut the healthcare system devised by his predecessor, and make clear that as president he is not turning toward more moderate positions than he took as a candidate. His directives on Wednesday signaled a tough action toward the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants already in the United States, most from Latin America, whom he already has threatened to deport. In a move critics called a slight to the integrity of American democracy, Trump also said on Wednesday he would seek a â€œmajor investigationâ€ into what he believes was voter fraud in the November election, despite overwhelming consensus among state officials, election experts and politicians that it is rare in the United States.  â€œWe are going to restore the rule of law in the United States,â€ Trump told an audience that included relatives of people killed by illegal immigrants at the Department of Homeland Security after signing two executive orders. The directives ordered the construction of a multibillion-dollar wall along the roughly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico border, moved to strip federal funding from â€œsanctuaryâ€ states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants, and expanded  the force of American immigration agents. His plans prompted an outcry from immigrant advocates and Democratic lawmakers who said Trump was jeopardizing the rights and freedoms of millions of people while treating Mexico as an enemy, not an ally, and soiling Americaâ€™s historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants of all stripes. â€œThe border wall is about political theater at the expense of civil liberties,â€ said Christian Ramirez, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition immigrant advocacy group. â€œIt is not national security policy. Border communities are among the safest in the nation, and patrolling them with tens of thousands of heavily armed, poorly trained, unaccountable agents puts lives at risks. This will turn these communities into de facto military zones,â€ Ramirez said. The White House said the wall would stem the flow of drugs, crime and illegal immigration into the United States. â€œWe are in the middle of a crisis on our southern border: The unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from Central America is harming both Mexico and the United States,â€ Trump said, adding: â€œA nation without borders is not a nation.â€ The immigration crackdown has sparked fear among so-called â€œdreamers,â€ whose parents brought them to the United States illegally and who received temporary deportation relief and work permits from President Barack Obama. Trump said the dreamers should not fear deportation. â€œThey shouldnâ€™t be very worried,â€ Trump told ABC News in an interview broadcast on Wednesday.. â€œWhere you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried,â€ he said, adding: â€œWeâ€™ll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks.â€ House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan also said the â€œdreamersâ€ should not be worried. â€œWeâ€™re focused on physical security of the border, weâ€™re focused on those who are coming to do us harm from terrorist states and things like that,â€ he told MSNBC. Trump is also expected to order a review that could lead to bringing back a CIA program for holding terrorism suspects in secret overseas â€œblack siteâ€ prisons where interrogation techniques often condemned as torture were used during former Republican President George W. Bushâ€™s administration, two U.S. officials said.  Trumpâ€™s actions could further test relations with Mexico. The wall plan has infuriated Mexicans. Trumpâ€™s policies, including his demand that the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada be renegotiated or scrapped, have put Mexicoâ€™s government on the defensive. Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto are due to meet next week. Pena Nieto said on Wednesday night that he â€œregrets and disapprovesâ€ of the push by Trump to build a new wall along the border. Officials in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Denver, Washington, San Francisco and Seattle offer some forms of protection to illegal immigrants. Billions of dollars in federal aid to those cities, often governed by Democrats, could be at risk under Trumpâ€™s move. In the ABC News interview, Trump said construction on the wall would start within months, with planning starting immediately, and that Mexico would pay back to the United States â€œ100 percentâ€ of the costs. Mexican officials have said they will not pay for the wall. The White House said Trumpâ€™s goal was to get the wall started as quickly as possible using existing government funds and then work with the Republican-led Congress on further appropriations. Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a key element of his presidential campaign, with supporters at his rallies often chanting: â€œBuild the wall.â€ The cost, nature and extent of the wall remain unclear. Trump last year put the cost at â€œprobably $8 billion,â€ although other estimates are higher, and he said the wall would span 1,000 miles (1,600 km) because of the terrain of the border. Trumpâ€™s directives would end the practice known by critics as â€œcatch and releaseâ€ in which authorities apprehend illegal immigrants on U.S. territory but do not immediately detain or deport them. The directives also include hiring 5,000 more U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents used to apprehend people seeking to slip across the border and tripling the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents used to arrest and deport immigrants living in the United States illegally. They also create more detention space for illegal immigrants along the southern border to make it easier to detain and deport them. The intent of the proposals regarding refugees and immigrants from the seven Muslim-majority nations is to head off Islamist violence in the United States. The draft directive on immigration also suspends the U.S. refugee program for four months while determining whether permanent changes to the system are needed.", "output": "1. True"}

Fallin, a Republican, suggested using $51 million for public schools to prevent a four-day school week and $21 million for the Department of Corrections to head off draconian cuts to prisons.  The Rainy Day Fund contains $385 million, of which $144.4 million is available to address the 2016 fiscal year revenue failure, according to Fallinâ€™s office.   â€œThe deepened revenue failure cuts have changed the budget situation in a way that requires immediate action, so I support accessing the Rainy Day Fund for common education and prisons,â€ Fallin said.  She said withdrawing from the fund was the most responsible option available to keep vital services at acceptable levels until an agreement on recurring revenues can be reached between the governor and the legislature.   â€œThe Rainy Day Fund option is a one-time fix, but we need to do the tough work to establish a permanent fix in the budget we pass this session,â€ she said.  Oil-related tax revenue accounted for 10 percent of Oklahomaâ€™s budget at the peak of the shale oil boom in 2014.  The state has already cut spending on education, which accounts for a third of its $7 billion budget, by $25 million in the 2015-2016 fiscal year, and another $20 million cut looms.

In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBSâ€™ â€œFace the Nation,â€ drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense â€œdiscretionaryâ€ spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. â€œThe (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: â€˜Weâ€™re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,â€™â€ Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. â€œNow, Democrats are saying thatâ€™s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I donâ€™t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other peopleâ€™s money,â€ he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their partyâ€™s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. â€œItâ€™s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,â€ Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. â€œThis is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills weâ€™ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think weâ€™re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,â€ Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or â€œentitlement reform,â€ as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, â€œentitlementâ€ programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryanâ€™s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the â€œDreamers,â€ people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. â€œWe need to do DACA clean,â€ she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.", "output": "1. True"}

Congress, dominated by the right-wing Popular Force party, ousted Kuczynski s previous cabinet in September in a dispute over a teachers strike and school curriculum that emphasizes gender equality. In response, Kuczynski formed a more socially conservative cabinet led by Prime Minister Mercedes Araoz, one of his vice presidents and a lawmaker in his party. Several opposition lawmakers wished Araoz  cabinet luck during more than 14 hours of debate before the vote of confidence. Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, took office in July 2016 promising to modernize Peru and strengthen its economy. But his first year in office has been marked by clashes with Congress and slowing economic growth. Araoz told local broadcaster RPP on Friday that the government is planning to revise tax policies to look for ways to close loopholes that have dragged on public revenue. Araoz said on Thursday that she is going to ask Congress to grant her cabinet special powers to legislate economic policies.", "output": "1. True"}

By a vote of 407 to 1, lawmakers approved a bill that would guarantee the Financial Stability Oversight Council is not forced to remove its current insurance expert when his term expires, even though no replacement has been named. The bill would address what appears to be a technical oversight of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. That law, which created the FSOC, failed to include language that would allow the panelâ€™s insurance expert to remain on the council for 18 more months, or until a replacement is named. As the law currently stands, the FSOCâ€™s current insurance expert, S. Roy Woodall, would be forced to vacate that seat on Sept. 27, when his six-year term expires. Debate over altering the 2010 law has been intensely partisan in the U.S. Congress, and Tuesdayâ€™s bill appears to be one of just a handful of changes that could be made to the law since it was enacted. The FSOC is charged with monitoring the largest and most significant financial institutions, and has identified a handful of insurance companies as meriting stricter oversight as â€œsystemically significantâ€ firms. Woodall is the only member with primarily insurance expertise on the panel. The House Financial Services Committee unanimously passed the bill in July, and the Senate Banking Committee will take up a similar measure on Thursday. â€œThis bill protects against an unintended vacancy of the independent member with insurance expertise by providing a contingency plan that is comparable to what is already in place for most of the other voting members of FSOC,â€ said Dirk Kempthorne, president and chief executive of the American Council of Life Insurers, an industry group. Also on Tuesday, the House approved a bill that alters existing Securities and Exchange Commission rules, in a bid to grant more access to smaller companies seeking to raise capital under a relaxed regulatory framework. That measure, the Improving Access to Capital Act, had also been passed by the House in 2015 but never became law.", "output": "1. True"}

While I slept, nine people were murdered attending Wednesday night Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Rev. Clementa Pinckney, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Cynthia Hurd, Tywanza Sanders, Myra Thompson, Ethel Lee Lance, Rev. Daniel L. Simmons, Rev. Depayne Middleton-Doctor, and Susie Jackson lost their lives during a midweek service in which they welcomed a newcomer, Dylann Storm Roof, who would later turn a gun on them, careful to leave a living witness to recount the details of what happened. It does not escape me that it was witnessing â€” a term used to refer to an act of Christian discipleship where one shares their faith with nonbelievers â€” that likely resulted in Roofâ€™s invitation to join the weekly gathering, and it was the need for an (eye)witness that led him to intentionally spare the life of one of the victims.\n\nThe racist and terrorist act was premeditated and deemed aÂ hate crime, even though some media pundits insisted that it was motivated by antagonism towards Christianity, not black people. I believe it was both. The shooting was not only an assault on black humanity, it was an attack on black faith, which is one of the few things black folk have left in the face of so much loss, despair and ongoing oppression. For generations, black folk have turned to their religious faith and to the church for comfort during times of social injustice (as evidenced in the rich and storied history of Emanuel Church).\n\nNow, one of the few safe spaces that black folk can seek out for refuge has been turned into a crime scene.\n\nRoofâ€™s targeting of a place of worship is an attempt to compromise the safety and sanctity of the black church. Before Wednesday night, the black church seemed to be one of the few places left where black folk could assemble in public and feel seen, recognized, heard, loved and welcome. (We know from the not-so-distant past that those spaces are not the private communities in which we live, not store parking lots, not Walmart stores, not public parks, not street corners, not swimming pools, not even our homes.)\n\nAnd, truth be told, while traditional black churches are safe spaces from white supremacy, they have long been unsafe spaces for folk who are gender non-conforming, same-gender loving, or women. It is important, as we hold up the black church as a whole after this tragedy, that we also hold it up to scrutiny, so that as we do the work of making church spaces safe again, we make sure that they are safe for all of us, all of the time.\n\nI believe this moment is an opportunity for the black church to re-establish itself through the proven resiliency of black faith, and become a safe and welcome space for all believers. This is a moment to understand that in order to fight and resist white supremacy we must also dismantle and fight its co-conspirators: homophobia, transphobia, and sexism. Many times churchfolk and skinfolk are afraid of the wrong things. It is white supremacy, not nonheterosexuality, that threatens the lives and legacies of black folk in this country. It is white supremacy, not premarital sex or babies born out of wedlock, that jeopardizes our survival. It wasÂ white supremacy, not insanity, that caused Dylann Roof to walk into a black church intending to walk out with blood on his hands. We need healing that is corporate, collective, consistent and accountable.\n\nThe victims of the shooting should not have to be martyrs, hashtags, or statistics to show, once again, that our country continues to fail at holding white supremacy accountable for the death it perpetuates. This is a moment of love but also of accountability. We can hold well-meaning white allies accountable for being speechless while we are being senselessly murdered, and being sensitive and offended when we express our outrage. We can hold our policymakers accountable, insisting that the Confederate flag, a symbol of anti-black hate, be removed from government spaces (to make them safe for people of color). We can hold our churches and places of worship accountable, requiring inclusivity over conservatism, and demonstrating agape love out in the open.Â  We can hold ourselves and our loved ones accountable, in all the ways we need and all the ways we know, because, as Audre Lorde taught us, our silence will not protect us. We are living in a moment where being black is equally commodified and criminalized, where black people are fighting for dignity, security, humanity and the very right to blackness. This moment is a reminder that in a so-called post racially progressive world, being black remains simultaneously the most marketable, profitable, co-optable and dangerous identity marker one can hold. To be black is to be vulnerable no matter where you are and no matter where you go. To be black is to carry a marker on your skin that racists will use to identify you and in some cases kill you. Despite claims of colorblindness, or so-called transracialism, the black victims in church on Wednesday night could not claim whiteness to save themselves. It was, in fact, the pervasive lie of whiteness that cost them their life. If ever there was a place where black folk believe themselves to be free, it is within the walls of the church. There we dance, cry, pray, praise, shout, sing and testify. The doors are always open. Despite the personal challenges I have with the church, it has remained a beacon of hope, a place of healing and possibility, a refuge in times of trouble, and a safe space for lost souls and people in need, regardless of race. As a non-church-attending black woman who identifies as a Christian, I refuse to relinquish my faith to this tragedy. I refuse to allow Roofâ€™s hate to be the end of the story. I refuse to concede that we cannot, as a people, carve out spaces for each other and make room for one another (including difference) within and without the four walls of the church. This is for white girls who pretend to be black girls when white supremacy isnâ€™t enough. This is for black Christians who believe respectability will save our lives in the face of perpetual anti-black hetero-patriachal white supremacy, when evidence to the contrary is consistently given. This is for those of us seeking hope and holding on to faith but lacking patience. This is not enough, but it is a beginning.", "output": "1. True"}

As important, Lynch, with the help of committee Democrats, painted an unassailable biography: This daughter of a fourth-generation minister and a segregation-fighting mother from the South would be the first African American woman to be the nationâ€™s top law enforcement official.\n\nThe case against Lynch deflated faster than if the New England Patriots had run the hearing.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) toned down his prepared statement as he read it. â€œI, for one, need to be persuaded that she will be an independent attorney general,â€ he read, but he then departed from the text and added, â€œI have no reason to believe at this point she wonâ€™t be.â€ He read a long list of complaints about the administrationâ€™s actions but then ad-libbed, â€œAs far as I know, Ms. Lynch has nothing to do with the Department of Justice problems that I just outlined.â€\n\nThe panelâ€™s new Republican leadership was already on thin ice over its decision to remove the phrase â€œcivil rights and human rightsâ€ from the name of its subcommittee on the Constitution. The atmosphere in the room surely had to make the members of the all-white committee think twice before turning Lynch into a punching bag for their disagreements with Obama and Holder. More than half of those in the public seats were black, and 40 of them wore red â€” the color of Delta Sigma Theta, Lynchâ€™s predominantly black sorority.\n\nLynch, all of 5 feet tall, planted her spiked heels firmly on the floor in front of her and leaned her forearms on the witness table as she made her case. She described her mother as a â€œcourageous young teacher who refused to let Jim Crow define herâ€ and who â€œrefused to use segregated restrooms, because they did not represent the America in which she believed.â€ In North Carolina, she said, her father â€œopened his Greensboro church to those planning sit-ins and marches, standing with them while carrying me on his shoulders.â€\n\nDemocrats formed a chorus to repeat the message. â€œShe grew up hearing her family speak about living in the Jim Crow South,â€ Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said of the â€œhistoricâ€ nominee. Said Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), â€œHer mother picked cotton when she was a girl so her daughter would never have to.â€ (This line was rather more plausible than Schumerâ€™s jest that Lynch has a reputation for â€œavoiding the spotlight, just like me.â€)\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) described her as â€œwitness to a moment in historyâ€ because of her fatherâ€™s civil rights work, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told the story of how Lynchâ€™s school named a second valedictorian because it was thought having Lynch as sole valedictorian would be â€œtoo controversial.â€\n\nEven if Republicans had the appetite to challenge a nominee with such a life story, her lawyerly demurrals made it impossible for them to land a blow. Several times, Republican senators asked what she thought of an opinion from the Justice Departmentâ€™s Office of Legal Counsel defending Obamaâ€™s executive actions on immigration. She replied over and over that she found the opinion â€œreasonableâ€ and the overall policy legal, but she went no further.\n\nShe blended flattery â€” â€œI certainly think you raised an important point and would look forward to discussing it with you and relying upon your thoughts and experience,â€ she informed a skeptical Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) â€” with reminders that she had nothing to do with policies Republicans found objectionable.\n\nThe performance was disarming. After Lynch assured Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) that she would take the attorney generalâ€™s independence â€œvery seriously,â€ Hatch said that â€œyouâ€™ll be a great attorney general if youâ€™ll do that.â€\n\nEven the dyspeptic Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) acknowledged that his legal friends in New York describe her as â€œa U.S. attorney who honored and respected the law.â€\n\nAnd freshman Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) positively gushed to Lynch about her â€œpatience, perseverance, professionalism and .â€‰.â€‰. graciousness.â€\n\nSen.

The aim is to strike a balance between security and not overloading residents with restrictions.  We re looking at introducing (street) obstacles that could be mobile,  Joaquin Forn, who is in charge of home affairs in Catalonia, told a news conference on Wednesday. A van plowed into crowds of holidaymakers and local residents on Barcelona s crowded Las Ramblas boulevard last Thursday, killing 13 people. Two others were killed during the driver s getaway and in a separate attack in Cambrils. The Barcelona rampage reignited a row over how cities can better prevent such attacks. Militants have used trucks and cars as weapons to kill nearly 130 people in France, Germany, Britain, Sweden and Spain over the past 13 months. Catalan authorities may also erect some permanent barriers and turn some streets into pedestrian-only thoroughfares, Forn said. The regional capital, which receives around 30 million visitors a year, is home to several landmarks designed by architect Antoni Gaudi, including the towering Sagrada Familia. Forn added that some 10 percent more police would be deployed. Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attacks in Catalonia, issued a video via one of its official channels on Wednesday showing two of its fighters making threats in Spanish against Spain, interspersed with images of the aftermath of the Barcelona attack. One fighter pledged to avenge Muslim blood spilled by the Spanish Inquisition, established in 1478, and what he said was the killing Spain was currently engaged in against Islamic State. This was an apparent reference to Iraq, where Spain has several hundred soldiers training local forces in the fight against Islamic State. Investigators are still looking into whether the suspects behind last week s attacks had links to France or Belgium and are examining their movements over recent weeks as they look for connections to possible cells elsewhere in Europe.  The car used in the attack in Cambrils, south of Barcelona, was caught on camera speeding in the Paris region days earlier.  We are still trying to establish why they were in the Paris area,  French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters at a joint news conference in Paris with his Spanish counterpart on Wednesday.  Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said France and Spain would continue to reinforce border checks and step up information exchanges, including of passenger information in real time. One of the suspects has said the leader of the militant group was an imam, Abdelbaki Es Satty, who died a day before the Barcelona attack when a house the group was using to build bombs blew up. Court officials in Spain s Valencia region said on Wednesday that Spain had issued an expulsion order against Es Satty after he served a four-year jail term for drug-trafficking but that this was annulled by a court in 2015 after Es Satty appealed. The judge at the time overturned the expulsion order partly because Es Satty had employment roots in Spain which he said  shows his efforts to integrate in Spanish society.   A dozen Islamist militants suspected of involvement in the plot were either killed or arrested. A judge on Tuesday ordered two suspects jailed, one remained in police custody pending further investigation and a fourth was freed with conditions.", "output": "1. True"}

[The company, founded by   Rican immigrants in New York, will withdraw $200, 000 in patronage from the event, according to local legislators.  LÃ³pez Rivera, identified as the head of the radical Marxist Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) terrorist group, was freed Wednesday after receiving a pardon from President Barack Obama. His supporters argue that he is an icon of Puerto Rican nationalism, a deeply divisive issue among the U. S. citizens who inhabit the island and praise his refusal to accept a pardon from President Bill Clinton that required him to express remorse for his participation in terrorist acts. Goyaâ€™s withdrawal from the parade followed news that LÃ³pez Rivera would be honored the title of â€œIcon of Libertyâ€ at the event, scheduled for June 11. The corporationâ€™s public relations head, Rafael Toro, told Fox News, however, that the decision not to participate in the event was not directly tied to LÃ³pez Rivera. â€œIt was a business decision not to participate in the parade,â€ Toro said, noting that a false company statement had made the rounds on social media. Despite the clarification, the move may result in added pressure on other corporate sponsors to also withdraw from the parade or risk being seen as supporters of terrorism. The Associated Press notes that among those corporations still participating are the    companies ATT, Coca Cola, and the New York Yankees. The New York newspaper El Diario La Prensa credits a group called the Youth of the New Progressive Party for beginning a social media campaign calling for the boycott of any corporation that participates in the celebration. LÃ³pez Rivera himself dismissed Goyaâ€™s withdrawal and threatened the business with a boycott. â€œI think Goya would have more to lose if Puerto Rico boycotted it, and all Puerto Ricans, here and in the diaspora, boycotted Goya. So I think Goya has more to lose than us,â€ he told reporters. LÃ³pez Rivera arrived in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Wednesday, greeted by an estimated four dozen supporters â€œholding flowers and Puerto Flags, some chanting â€˜Free at last! â€™â€ according to the Associated Press. New York State Sen. Rev. RubÃ©n DÃ­az wrote in a column on his Facebook page that he has heard rumors that the airline Jet Blue may also withdraw from the parade, though Jet Blue has not considered withdrawing its business from the neighboring Caribbean country of Cuba, which maintains ties to terrorist groups like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Hezbollah. In his column, DÃ­az lamented Goyaâ€™s exit and called, â€œas a Puerto Rican,â€ for the company to reconsider. â€œWithout Goya,â€ he wrote, â€œthe parade has no seasoning. â€ Parade organizers have not indicated that they have considered backing down from awarding the terrorists an honorific title at the ethnic pride event. In a statement published on their official website on May 12, organizers insisted that LÃ³pez Rivera was worthy of praise despite his remorseless history of violence: We aim to use Oscar LoÌpez Rivera and his story  â€”   decades after  â€”   to bring a message for peace, unity, compassion and reflection. Amidst the controversies surrounding LoÌpez Rivera, we have been compelled by his early work as a community activist of Chicagoâ€™s Puerto Rican community, and that his convictions led to more than 35 years without freedom, of which 12 were spent in solitary confinement several U. S. political leaders have conceded that Oscarâ€™s   sentence was out of proportion. Also, given the opportunity to shorten his time behind bars, he did not accept President Clintonâ€™s 1999 clemency, expressing that he could not leave behind Carlos Alberto Torres, who was detained along Oscar but was not included in Clintonâ€™s clemency offer. A key organizer of the event, New York City Council Speaker Melissa   affirmed this in a statement from Puerto Rico, where she had traveled to welcome LÃ³pez Rivera to freedom. â€œHis release is not only a win for our island, but for our countryâ€™s democracy and criminal justice system â€”  and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m proud that tireless advocacy led to President Obama granting Oscar clemency,â€ she said. â€œWe stand in solidarity with Oscar, and I thank the National Puerto Rican Day parade for recognizing and uplifting his legacy. â€ LÃ³pez Riveraâ€™s FALN group is reportedly responsible for at least 130 bombings, mostly in New York, Chicago, and Puerto Rico, believed to have caused at least five deaths and more than $3 million in property damage. LÃ³pez Rivera himself was sentenced to 55 years in prison in 1981, in a trial in which he told the judge, â€œI am an enemy of the United States government. â€ President Clinton offered LÃ³pez Rivera a commutation of his sentence in 1999 that he rejected some argue he did so because a fellow FALN member was not offered the same deal, though LÃ³pez Rivera said in an interview the year before that he had â€œproblemsâ€ with â€œatonementâ€ and refused to condemn his terrorist acts before being freed.

Questions about Morneau s potential conflict of interest follow weeks of backlash over the finance minister s attempt to reform small business taxes and have become a major stumbling block for Trudeau s two-year-old Liberal government.     Morneau, the multimillionaire former chief executive officer of human resources management firm Morneau Shepell Inc, asked on Tuesday to meet with the federal ethics watchdog to discuss his decision not to put his assets into a blind trust, as Trudeau himself has done.  The conflict of interest and ethics commissioner gave clear advice to the minister of finance, which he followed, and which he will continue to follow,  Trudeau said in parliament, declining to answer questions about when he knew Morneau had not used a blind trust. Morneau has said he sought the advice of Ethics Commissioner Mary Dawson to avoid conflicts of interest.  The troubled tax reform and focus on Morneau s personal wealth risk derailing the Liberal agenda just as the government heads into the second half of its four-year mandate facing newly elected opposition leaders. While Morneau has been a relatively low-profile finance minister, he has been the face of the government s plan to boost infrastructure spending, a project expected to boost economic growth and widely supported by financial market players. Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, said financial markets would be largely unaffected if Morneau leaves his job, as long as he is replaced by somebody with the same views and fiscal plans.  If you were to tell me that the criticism of him is really partly a veiled criticism of fiscal expansion strategy and that his demise could trigger a change in fiscal policy, it would be somewhat more important,  Chandler said, adding markets are more worried about the possible demise of NAFTA and future rate hikes by the Bank of Canada than the tempest over Morneau. Morneau is expected to provide a fall fiscal update soon, possibly as early as next week, forecasting a gradual reduction in the budget deficit from an estimated C$28.5 billion this year. He denied rumors in September that he was unhappy in his post, saying he has  enjoyed this job from day one,  but his rise from obscurity to the most scrutinized cabinet ministers has happened fast.  The problem is that to the extent people don t know much about Bill Morneau, they are learning about him now, and it s kind of all the wrong things,  said Ipsos Public Affairs pollster Darrell Bricker. Bricker said the Liberal lead over the Conservatives has been trimmed to just 3 or 4 percentage points in recent weeks, a surprising tightening given Trudeau s personal popularity at home and abroad. The next federal election is in 2019. A Morneau spokesman declined on Tuesday to say whether the minister holds any Morneau Shepell shares or what he did with his assets and holdings to guard against conflict of interest. According to public disclosure documents available through the office of the Ethics Commissioner, Morneau is full or part owner of two holding companies as well as several real estate holding companies, and is party to a conflict of interest screen to ensure he abstains from decisions related to his company.", "output": "1.

Several firefighters burst into tears. â€œThey had been trying to put out the fire for hours when suddenly the building just collapsed,â€ said Ibrahim Najafi, a cosmetics seller, who could see the building crashing down from his shop window. He said there were 590 stores, offices and warehouses in the building. â€œMy friends are in there. What a horrible day. â€ People at the scene were visibly upset and the police were required to control angry crowds who yelled at security forces, who they said had arrived too late. â€œMy friend is calling me from under the rubble, help him,â€ one man was heard shouting. In the chaotic aftermath of the collapse, ambulances had to fight their way through onlookers drawn to the scene, some taking selfies in front of the rubble. Army conscripts were deployed to clear paths for the emergency vehicles. The   the   Plasco Building in the center of Tehran, housed a shopping center and garment manufacturers, and it was as familiar to most residents as the Empire State Building is in New York. Built in 1962 by Habib Elghanian, an   businessman, and named for his   company, it was Tehranâ€™s first modern   and long stood as a symbol of the drive for modernization during the reign of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. After the 1979 revolution, Mr. Elghanian was accused of spying for Israel and was executed. Firefighters said the blaze appeared to have started in the morning on the 11th floor before spreading to a floor below, trapping some of their colleagues inside. Firefighters on the ground stared upward as the fire advanced, apparently horrified by the predicament faced by those in the building. Two of them comforted a colleague, his face ashen, as he knelt, pointing at the building. The choreography of the structureâ€™s collapse played out with cinematic inevitability. First, one side of the building crashed, just missing a firefighter standing on a ladder, The Associated Press reported. Then the rest came down. So dense were the plumes of smoke that Jalal Maleki, a spokesman for Tehranâ€™s fire brigade, told The A. P. that the cloud was â€œvisible from the southern parts of Tehran,â€ miles away. Masoumeh Abad, a member of the Tehran City Council, said tenants of the building had been warned â€œat least 20 timesâ€ that maintenance was needed, the semiofficial news agency Fars reported. But local news outlets suggested that the municipality had been lax in carrying out safety regulations. The Plasco Building had been fully stocked with garments for the Iranian New Year on March 21, for which Iranians traditionally shop for new clothes, and there were reports that the clothing had choked the hallways, impeding the work of firefighters.", "output": "1.

But the question should not be whether Trump could even turn his back on the Kurds in his fight against ISIS. It is more, whether Trump can trust the Turkish leader to not shift the goalposts at the last minute Martin Jay 21st Century WireTurkey s authoritarian leader, who recently brilliantly played a central role in both brokering the recent  safe zones  deal   backed by Iran and Russia   and signing off a new trade deal with Russia, seemed to be rising above the parapet as a regional leader. For a fleeting moment, this autocratic figure, who just scraped in by a whisker through a referendum to usher in new laws which would hurl Turkey truly into the depths of a third world country, shone for a moment. Coming out of the Astana talks, you watched the newsreel footage and almost forgot about the human rights apocalypse which the country is undergoing   from thousands of teachers, judges and civil servants being rounded up on charges linked to an attempted coup in the summer of 2016, right through to the worrying number of journalists locked up in jails, which is constantly compared to North Korea by many rights groups. There are currently over 250 journalists in jail in Turkey in a country where journalism has been pronounced dead under Erdogan s brutal crackdown.No matter. That won t bother Trump. But Erdogan s luck is still about to run out when he visits the US president who will bring him down to earth and show him exactly how much the Turkish leader is worth as a regional ally. We should all expect a bump, followed by a tantrum.Birds of the same feather? Could it be about personalities? When we look at both Erdogan and Trump, there are an alarming number of similarities which one might have thought would have played a role in bringing them closer. Both are nationalist leaders, frothing over their daily ratings, both extraordinarily thin-skinned and more importantly, equal in their colossal contempt for democracy and freedom of speech. Both leaders absolutely hate genuine journalists and what journalism, as an empirical, feature of democracy stands for: the absolute truth.But they are not twins. Erdogan is a political animal whereas Trump came into politics late and is driven by corporate power. Both though understand and resort to very short-term political churlishness and buffoonery. And here s where the worries lie, with Erdogan s plea for Trump to stop backing the Kurds in Northern Syria. When Trump sent 59 Tomahawk missiles into an Shayrat airbase in Syria, he was proving a point: that he, and America, is ultimately a super power. And super powers can do capricious, illogical things like that and still come out a winner. Trump needed to prove to regional leaders that he is capable of exulting military might after nearly all of his Middle East plans seemed to wane since taking office. And it worked. We may all be scratching our heads about the wisdom of hitting the Syrian Army s military infrastructure when the real target in Syria is ISIS, but it generated the media coverage and his popularity lifted back home. When Erdogan however bombed a number of Kurdish installations a few days later   almost following the example of the US president   it didn t have the same effect. Turkey aspires to be a super power but in reality is a fledgling compared to Saudi Arabia and Iran, or even Israel.Back home it was met with mixed reaction, while in Washington it backfired spectacularly. The Pentagon was shocked at how stupid the move was, given that US soldiers were only about 6 miles from the bombing and if they had been wounded or killed, then anything that Erdogan would have hoped to have achieved would have been dashed.Erdogan got the attention he wanted but he just made himself look like a loser in negotiations over how much power and support he demands in northern Syria as a new plan to take Raqqa unfolds; and how the US should now consider no longer arming the only fighting group on the ground in Syria which is fighting ISIS to any real degree, the YPG.Erdogan is beginning to come across as a jilted girlfriend who keeps making the moves to get the attention of Trump, but who just keeps on getting the cold shoulder though.He has been hoping since January that the so-called architect of the attempted coup in Turkey, Fethullah G len, could be extradited by Trump. He has been also hoping for the Kurds to be left out of the push for Raqqa; and he has been suggesting that Turkey and the US should take the city together in the final push for the epicentre of Islamic extremism.Ultimate threat and unsavoury alliancesErdogan has misjudged Trump though, which might explain why none of the three plans have unfolded. This is not a US leader who will be intimidated with threats, like the Kurd bombing. Quite the contrary. The result is that US officials and Donald Trump himself have started to humour Erdogan, for two chief reasons. Trump has investments in Turkey and Erdogan s ultimate threat would be to kick US soldiers and airman out of Incirlik airbase and to sell it to the highest bidder on the geopolitical circuit. The problem with Erdogan, Trump advisers will no doubt be telling him, is not that he has so little to offer militarily in the region. It s that he can t be trusted. They will point to his irrational relations he courts, then rejects, then restores again which makes him look erratic and untrustworthy   whether its erratic relations with Israel, Russia or even NATO and the EU. There are just too many u-turns. Erdogan sees Russia as the new trading partner and this is where his real interests and loyalties lie. And then there s Iran, considered by the Trump camp to be the very crux of America s problems in the region and vehemently hated by most of his advisers who are planning to bomb it at some point    which Turkey desperately wants to develop relations with both with trade and energy deals. But it s not just Iran and Russia which will irk Trump when he considers Erdogan s last chance gambit to save the Turkish leader s neck as he has to convince voters in two years that he   and his new anti-democratic grasp on the country s judges, media and other key institutions   is the winning ticket for Turkey. No, it s more about the relations that Erdogan has had with groups in Syria   like ISIS and Jabat al Nusra, which few doubt were being supported by Turkey at some point. Let s not forget that ISIS managed to swell its numbers dramatically by foreign jihadists crossing its southern border; for a long time, extremists were seen as a way to destabilize the Assad government in Syria, hence allies of Turkey.Erdogan has left it too long to come into the anti-ISIS theatre to be taken seriously. And so Erdogan s point of view that the US should not be backing the YPG and PYD in Syria   due to their links to the PKK   is actually a triumph of futility, as arguments go. Washington, certainly the Pentagon which Trump takes seriously, doesn t take Erdogan s offer to take Raqqa together seriously. It would probably involve too many US soldiers (whereas the Kurd plan won t) and the Turks would probably shift the goalposts at the last moment.Russia s foreign minister s meeting with Trump is a different matter. Super powers meet super powers and important decisions are thrashed out. When Erdogan arrives, he will be treated like an annoying neighbour who has arrived at the party late, on the pretext of complaining about the noise but really wanting to just worm his way in for a free drink. Small people, small issues.Adversaries of Erdogan close to Trump will also no doubt be raising the obvious question of how far can the US trust a regional leader, who, just days before a referendum which would give him more power, changed the voting rules which gave him the critical few percent at the polls?Erdogan s people have no confidence in their own leader in DCMoreover, the unspoken but very real threat that he may attack the Kurds on a grander scale is also not a point which Trump will appreciate. Even from a political dimension, it would make him look isolated and petulant as sour grapes never won anyone any votes at the polls. But it s also the lack of confidence Erdogan and his people have in their own arguments. Senior advisors to Erdogan have told me that the Washington trip is so important that they don t want to risk anything ruining the event. Yet how much credibility in the first place can you give to Erdogan s visit when paranoia and a shocking lack of confidence in Erdogan s ploy are so patently evident?Recently, an Oped article I wrote for a newspaper I have since discovered is Erdogan s english language propaganda sheet, was rejected because its criticism of Trump might scupper the talks. Hilariously, it was explained to me by one of the  journalists  on The Daily Sabah that  the talks are so important that we can t publish anything which is critical of Trump    hardly a sterling mark of confidence from an Erdogan fake news journal whose entire role is to promote the Turkish leader. If an innocuous Oped from a British journalist in a propaganda sheet is all it takes to ruin the talks, one could only assume that even Erdogan s own people have no faith in their leader s arguments or charisma, let alone his geopolitical edge. Where will the deluded Erdogan go after this inevitable climb down? I m expecting a grand tantrum and an even closer relationship with Russia. I m expecting some bombing of Kurds. And I m also expecting Erdogan to play the Incirlik card. What I am not expecting is my Turkish editors to keep their word and pay me what I am due for work which was commissioned by them. Erdogan s people just can t be trusted.Journalist Martin Jay recently won the U.N. s prestigious Elizabeth Neuffer Memorial Prize (UNCA) in New York in 2016, for his journalism work in the Middle East.

The suicide rate in the state of Colorado reached an all-time high last year. As of 2015, Colorado had the seventh-highest suicide rate in the country. As a high school teacher, Darras has not been untouched by these statistics.According to a post Darras published to Facebook on May 24, the teacher recently learned that she d come  way too close to losing another student to suicide. Two months ago was the first time I cried during parent/teacher conferences. A mom of a student who I have taught for two years showed up at my table with a list of her daughter s teachers. Each one had  yes  or  no  written next to it. As the teacher explained during an interview with KOAA, the student s mother had asked her daughter to identify which of her teachers were  safe to tell,  by writing yes or no by their names.Darras  post continues: My name had a  yes  next to it, so she proceeded to explain to me the reason for her daughter s extended absence. Her daughter- a friendly, intelligent, beautiful, driven, young woman- not only planned to commit suicide, but was in the act of doing so when the police got a Safe 2 Tell report, broke in, and stopped her. She had deleted her social media accounts and left goodbye letters; she was ready to leave the world. Darras wrote that she and the student s mother  had tears streaming down our faces. The teacher asked what she could do that might make a difference in the life of the student she d nearly lost to suicide.She wrote: Feeling helpless, I asked if I could write my student a letter to be delivered to her at the hospital; she said her daughter would love that. My student got the letter; her mom said that her daughter cried, turned to her mom and said,  How could somebody say such nice things about me? I didn t think anybody would miss me if I was gone.' She didn t stop there, though. Darras spent the next two months writing personal letters to every one of the 130 students that she teaches. She took the time to tell each student what is special and unique about them. One student who received one of the teacher s handwritten letters described it as  just incredible. During an interview with KOAA the student said: I was just first of all surprised by how much she wrote. Usually when people write letters, it s like one or two sentences, like either  Happy Birthday,  or  Merry Christmas,  or  I hope you re doing fine.' But Darras letters to her students show that she cares deeply for each and every one of them.In her Facebook post, which has now been shared 164,000 times, the teacher wrote: Suicide is growing to be more and more common, and I can t help but to think that it s a direct result of the pressure we put on these kids- to be successful, to fit in, to be the best in their class/sport/etc. We need to remember that each human being is unique, and that is what makes them special. Instead of trying to change it, we need to embrace it, because together, we can make a difference, and we can save lives! By taking the time to show each of her students that they are valued, this teacher is undoubtedly making a difference in their lives.Here s more on this story from KOAA:KOAA.com | Continuous News | Colorado Springs and PuebloFeatured image via video screen capture via KOAA", "output": "0.

In the same way that the cinema and TV screen made “the opera and the novel” much smaller, something else might be on the way to do the same thing, the Netflix boss said at a Wall Street Journal event. \nThose challenges could come from anywhere, he said. They might not be another form of screen: “Is it VR, is it gaming, is it pharmacological?” Mr Hastings asked the event. \nHe went on to say that it might be possible that in the coming years someone will develop a drug that will make people get the same experiences that at the moment come from streaming services like Netflix. Apparently making reference to The Matrix, he said that we might be able to take one pill to escape into a hallucination and then another to come back. \n“In twenty or fifty years, taking a personalized blue pill you just hallucinate in an entertaining way and then a white pill brings you back to normality is perfectly viable,” Mr Hastings said. “And if the source of human entertainment in thirty or forty years is pharmacological we’ll be in real trouble.” \nHis references to The Matrix – and to being in “trouble” – recall arguments that have recently been made by tech billionaires including Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Both have suggested that it might be possible that we are part of a simulated universe – something that they said might be part of a virtual reality world, but could just as easily be the result of a drug-induced hallucination. \nMr Hastings didn’t indicate whether or not Netflix would look to make such drugs itself, or how it would fend off any companies that did. But it does sound a little like something out Black Mirror, which Netflix is showing the new season of at the moment.", "output": "0. Fake"}

Source: Elena Kern / press-photo \nWhere did you find the courage to go to the Middle East to make a film on migrants? \nMaria Ivanova: I began making my film in Berlin, in a camp for refugees. I was searching for a female protagonist. But when I arrived, I was told that girls do not flee Syria alone, only with their husbands or relatives. \nIn the end I visually began \"capturing\" interesting faces. I found my protagonist – 14-year-old Muhammad, who was sent by his parents to Germany alone. He did the whole journey alone so that later he could get his relatives out of Syria through the legal process of family reunification. \nDuring the shooting I understood that next I needed to go to Damascus, where this boy's parents remained. Due to the hassle in obtaining a Syrian visa my cameraman and I traveled to Syria through Beirut. In Lebanon you don't need a visa. Russian journalist in Syria: We came within a whisker of death \nAs we were driving along the road I knew that ISIS was only 10 kilometers [6 miles] away, very near. We were driving incredibly fast, 200 kilometers per hour, and when the driver saw a motorcycle coming, the car quickly turned around and headed in the opposite direction. “Why?” I asked later. Because terrorists often drive around at night on motorcycles. \nThat’s how we got to Damascus. There was no heating in the apartment we were taken to. No electricity and hot water. We slept on something similar to a couch. There are no real beds in the real East. And at three in the morning I heard bombing. \nIs all of Damascus in this state? \nM.I.: I was in the south and there it was frightening to walk out on the street. People have fear in their eyes, the atmosphere is very heavy. \nIn the end did you meet the parents of your protagonist Muhammad? How did you contact them? \nM.I.: They welcomed us with open arms. They fed us. They have all means of communication, they use social networks. After meeting with them we returned to Beirut and went to the refugee camps in Lebanon's mountains, filming there for two weeks. \nWere the Lebanese camps different from the German ones? \nM.I.: Of course. Lebanon doesn’t have special conditions. There’s a character in our film, a man who has 17 children. He lives in a tent that he has divided into several parts. He patches up the holes. They all sleep on the floor. Despite their horrible position, these people offered us food and played the oud for us [an Arabian musical instrument – RBTH]. They joked… Their life is based on the hope that they will return home. Of course, many want to go to Europe. They fill out applications. But Europe does not accept everyone. \nIn general, Lebanon is an unusual country. Just think, there are 18 religious confessions on a territory that is smaller than the Moscow Region. There are four million residents and one and a half million Syrian refugees. And yet, I never saw a conflict between, say, Christians and Muslims. They all go to the same restaurants, the same movie theaters, everyone is friendly. \nWhich films are you taking to the festival in Lebanon? \nM.I.: We finished this documentary film just a few days ago and I decided to hold the premiere in Lebanon, where we shot most of the material. Moreover, our partner, the TV channel RT, is producing two documentary films: Women against ISIS and Sector of Contradiction . The directors of these films are coming to answer questions and hold master classes. \nHow much is Russian culture present in Lebanon? Do people speak Russian there? \nM.I.: Many Lebanese studied in the Soviet Union. There is even an association of Soviet university graduates. These people speak Russian, many even married Russian citizens. Furthermore, there are 30,000 Russians living there. There are Lebanese who attend classes and study Russian. Sure, you mostly hear Arabic, English, French. Russian culture is not well known. So we sort of filled a vacuum. \nIs the war in the neighboring country felt in Lebanon? \nM.I.: You still feel the previous war, the civil war. There are buildings scarred by bombings. There are many military personnel, roadblocks, armored personnel carriers, patrols. But next to a destroyed building you can find a modern art gallery, which is followed by soldiers again, and then a modern theater. This is a patchwork country, it is very heterogeneous. Can a low-budget Russian disaster film look like a Hollywood blockbuster? \nOnce I was at the Sarajevo Film Festival, which had a really heavy atmosphere. There were no stadiums there. They had turned into cemeteries since there was no space for burying people. While in Lebanon you feel very light. You want to live, despite certain moments… The presence of soldiers, on the contrary, creates the feeling of security. \nI traveled there by car with a driver, saw beautiful cities, mountains, wine production. I went to an apple festival. I wasn’t afraid. The country has a modern airport, taxis, hotels, wonderful restaurants, beaches and movie theaters. But the thing is that no one anywhere will give you 100-percent guaranteed security, including when you're driving through France or Germany. In terms of security, Lebanon is no different than Europe. \nThe full interview can be found on RIA Novosti .

Nothing has been found.” \nResearchers will repeatedly scan the star for eight hours per night over the next two months to examine its extremely unusually dimming behavior. The star randomly dims by as much as 22 percent of its output at extremely irregular intervals. This is consistent with large orbiting masses, much larger than planets, blocking out some of the star’s light when they pass in front of it. All the natural forms of large masses which could cause KIC 8462852’s dimming aren’t consistent with the star’s age . \nScientists found the first possible evidence of this extraterrestrial civilization around KIC 8462852 last October , when astronomers with Yale University and other top schools published a study that used NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope. \nSo far, astronomers haven’t found a single naturalistic explanation for the star’s exceedingly unusual dimming, which explains the extremely unusual behavior of the star. Astronomers have examined 500 other stars in the vicinity of KIC 8462852, and seen nothing else like it. \nThe dense formations near KIC 8462852 are similar to “Dyson Spheres,” hypothetical, are energy-harvesting “megastuctures” theoretical aliens could hypothetically build by rearranging the solar system. Scientists have pondered the existence of Dyson Spheres since the 1960s, thinking they could be a potential solution to energy problems faced by an extremely old civilization. SETI scientists have long argued humans could detect distant alien civilizations by looking for technological artifacts like Dyson Spheres orbiting other stars. \n“We spent a long time trying to convince ourselves this wasn’t real. We just weren’t able to,” Ben Montet, a Caltech astronomer who co-authored research on the star, told Gizmodo . “None of the considered phenomena can alone explain the observations.” \nThe best naturalistic explanation favored by astronomers, involves a huge mass of comets erratically orbiting the star and creating enough dust to dim the light, but a January analysis of the star’s history renders that hypothesis implausible, since the unprecedented dimming has continued for over a century. In order to dim for such a long time period, the star would need to have millions of times more dust and comets orbiting it than is the case. \nAstronomers estimate that the dimming would require roughly 648,000 giant comets of 200 kilometers in diameter, all aligned to pass in front of the star. The chances of such a formation render it essentially impossible, and there is currently no remotely plausible scientific explanation for what is going on with KIC 8462852. \nAstronomers have previously frequently misjudge abnormal stellar occurrences and, usually, the abnormalities are simply a new phenomenon. \nA graduate student in astronomy, found an usual pulsing radio signal so predictable it seemed to be a sign of intelligent life in 1967. The astronomers even nicknamed the signal LGM-1, for “little green men,” and believed they had detected a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization , but it turned out to be the first pulsar.", "output": "0.

In the last four years, traditional retailers have cut more than 200,000 jobs. In contrast, Amazon is set to create 100,000 new full-time jobs over the year in the US.In the early days of Amazon.com the online retailer struggled to turn a profit. Inc. Magazine explains: Despite having revenues of $1.6 billion in 1999, Amazon still managed to lose $719 million. Things didn t get better in 2000, when it was found that Amazon had just around  $350 million of cash on hand,  despite raising billions of dollars. Traditional shopping malls and retailers simply cannot match the lower overhead Amazon business model. The difference between running a warehouse-based infrastructure and a fully operational, brick and mortar venue is pretty obvious   the costs in building and maintaining large bespoke spaces which require 24/7 maintenance and costly renovations, repairs, remodeling.Bloomberg reports: The owner of the Newgate Mall plans to pour $500,000 into overhauling the outdated food court in a bid to lure restaurateurs and hungry shoppers. Rent payments from eateries are never going to recoup the renovation costs, but for landlord Time Equities Inc., that s not the point. The point is survival. Costs are escalating as mall owners work to keep their real estate up to date and fill the void left by failing stores. The companies are turning to everything from restaurants and bars to mini-golf courses and rock-climbing gyms to draw in customers who appear more interested in being entertained during a trip to the mall than they are in buying clothes and electronics. The new tenants will pay higher rents than struggling chains such as Macy s and Sears, and hopefully attract more traffic for retailers at the property, according to Haendel St. Juste, an analyst at Mizuho Securities USA LLC. More than a dozen retailers have gone bankrupt this year as the shift toward online shopping accelerates. Even healthy companies are shutting hundreds of locations. As many as 13,000 stores are forecast to close next year, compared with 4,000 in 2016, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Inc. Are we looking at a new commercial property bubble forming here   as the late 20th century shopping model struggles to remain relevant? St. Juste certainly thinks so: The math is pretty obvious, pretty compelling, but there are risks,  St. Juste said in an interview.  This hasn t been done before on a broad scale. With so many traditional retailers failing to compete with Amazon, it s only a mater of time before there s an over-supply of commercial retail property on the market, leading to an inevitable drop in the price per square foot. How long until Amazon moves in and buys-up large retail properties on the cheap, and rolls-out Amazon s new brick and mortar digital shopping experience?READ MORE FINANCIAL NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Financial FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV", "output": "0.

His twitter feed was a mixture of stories about the violent suppression of a peaceful protest led by a Native American tribe directly affected by the environmental impact of the oil pipeline and news of the release of the Bundy militia – a group of out-of-state rabblerousers who believe the federal government should be disbanded. \n— 🇺🇸 (@theshrillest) October 27, 2016 \nThis is the second time the Bundy family threatened to kill federal agents and expressed a desire to lead a revolution only to see zero charges stick to them. The group will now get to return to Nevada, just in time for an election in which many conservatives are openly stating that they plan on taking up arms if Trump loses. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. \nOn November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. \nYou in? \n— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 \nIn short, it’s a scary time to be a democracy. An Oregon jury just gave every white male in the country a not-so-subtle nod that violence against the government will be met with a look the other way when it comes time to a trial. \nFeatured image via Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office/Getty Images Share this Article!", "output": "0.

There is a  President Steve Bannon  meme out there from coverage of the controversial advisor. In reality, his influence seems to be headed nowhere but down. First, he totally blew President Donald Trump s health care initiative. Then, his influence waned further when he openly seemed to fight with son-in-law Jared Kushner and urged the president to not take action in Syria. Now, Trump has even backpedaled on this demands that Congress fund the wall between the United States and Mexico, against the wishes of Steve Bannon.The border wall with Mexico was a big part of the Trump campaign. All of his rallies included a session of chanting with the audience of  Build the Wall!  For his part, Trump never acknowledged that Mexico is never going to pay for this expensive wall. It is also part of Bannon s dreams for the United States. His worldview, which was front and center during the president s Inaugural Address, needs this wall.Bannon is so enamored by the wall that he was pushing for a government shutdown to get Congress to include funding for it. Clearly, he learned nothing from the healthcare debacle where he told Trump to try to strong arm Congress into passing their bill because Trump wanted them to. Bannon s lack of experience dealing with our legislative branch is clear. As a co-equal branch of government, its members are never going to do something just because the White House tells them to. If you are thinking Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) pushed through Neil Goresuch s nomination because of this kind of work, you miss the win it gave McConnell.This week, Bannon told his supporters,  This is a stand worth taking.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Guardian Plays Robin to MI5s Batman By Jonathan Cook\n Today the Guardian offers decisive confirmation that it is only too willing to serve as an establishment mouthpiece. It proudly announces that it is the venue selected by Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, Britains FBI, to receive the agencys first-ever newspaper interview.\nIf the Guardian were a proper independent newspaper, it would regard this interview as a stain. Instead it bills it as a front-page exclusive. Exclusively, the Guardian has been given the chance to regurgitate MI5s propaganda  propaganda designed to help stoke a new Cold War with Russia.\nIn fact, this is not an interview as the Guardian claims, for the simple reason that the papers two interviewers  one of them its deputy editor, Paul Johnson  have no basis on which to question the quality of the classified information they are being fed.\nEverything Parker tells them could have been guessed at without the interview:\nthe Russians under Vladimir Putin are an evil empire; Islamic jihadists are everywhere but MI5 is brilliant at foiling their terror attacks; the increased budget MI5 has received is entirely justified because it is doing such a brilliant job of foiling terror attacks; MI5s extra powers to surveil us all are necessary to foil those terror attacks; whatever happens with Brexit, MI5 will continue doing a brilliant job protecting the British people; MI5 is determined to become a friendlier place for women and minority ethnic applicants. This isnt journalism, its the very definition of stenography.\nEven the Guardian seems to sense that its readers might wonder why this interview is being published in their newspaper. But rather than discuss why the Guardian would want to publish an interview with Parker, the paper asks the opposite question: why has MI5 chosen the Guardian? This is framed in a way to make it look as though Parker has entered a combative environment in coming to the Guardian. The paper reminds us that it broke the Edward Snowden story.\nIn fact, the Guardians Snowden revelations seem like another era. Remember that the Guardian got access to Snowdens documents only via their star columnist Glenn Greenwald, who has since departed after what appeared to be an increasingly troubled relationship, especially after the Snowden revelations. Instead Parker is once again given an opportunity to attack Snowden, accentuating the damage that was done to the work of British and allied intelligence agencies by Snowdens efforts to bring to public attention the systematic and secretive invasions of our privacy.\nThe Guardian is in far more comfortable territory playing Robin to MI5s Batman.\nSo why has Parker selected the Guardian rather than, say, the more obviously establishment London Times?\nBecause the Guardians articles are not behind a paywall and so are easily accessible to anyone online? Because it has become the preferred British news source for American elites, whose own media are even more servile to power? Because the Guardians (unjustified) reputation for leftwing and critical journalism will bestow on this MI5 press release the necessary pretence that Parker has been subjected to tough questioning from the Guardian? Or because Parker knew that the Guardian would be as docilely accepting of his propaganda as any rightwing outlet of the corporate media?\nDraw your own conclusions.\nJonathan Cook is a Nazareth- based journalist and winner of the Martha Gellhorn Special Prize for Journalism", "output": "0.

BREAKING: Rigging the Election – Video III: Creamer Confirms @HillaryClinton Involvement https://t.co/ozb1frZ7rR #Veritas @PVeritas_Action \n— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 24, 2016 \nThis third installment includes a shocking number of insights into how the Democratic Party has been running the Clinton campaign. Several of the most memorable quotes from the video include: \n“Nobody is really supposed to know about me.”-Aaron Black \n“So Brad, and Bob, and Lux, and myself are all part of the old school method where, it doesn’t matter what the freakin’ legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherf**ker.” -Aaron Black \n(In regards to the “Donald Duck” characters showing up at Trump events): “Skalar [Clinton operative] had gone to some buddy of his who is one of her body people and she explained the idea to Hillary. And Hillary just loved it. Let me tell you something, I think she has the right instinct here. This thing is working, is resonating but that story is not exactly what you want to hear about how presidential decision-making happens.” -Robert Creamer \nThe coordination between the Clinton Camp, the DNC, and Americans United for Change is a rather obvious violation of federal campaign finance laws regarding expenditures. DNC chair Donna Brazile was also involved in the coordination with the Clinton Camp as well. \nAdditionally, Robert Creamer discussed why the Donald Duck idea had to be owned by AUFC and not by the DNC. \n“The duck has to be an Americans United For Change entity. This had to do only with some problem between Donna Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. That’s why. It’s really silly.” \nLater in the video Creamer revealed why that is the case: \n“Donna Barzile had a connection with them and she didn’t want to get sued.” \nAnd finally, an explicit admission about Hillary’s desires, straight from Creamer himself: \n“We originally launched this duck because Hillary Clinton wants the duck.” \nWatch the full video below: \nThis certainly seems to be illegal campaigning, based on these videos. One of the interns even stated that there was a whole slew of reasons why responsibilities had to be divvied up, because the whole scheme was a mess. And why is that? Because they are violating campaign coordination law, so they have to. \nIt’s truly unbelievable. A plethora of revelations now show us how corrupt Hillary Clinton and the DNC are, yet there are still millions of people that support them. If these revelations continue, and they still support her, what can you really say? \nWhen corruption penetrates this deeply, and when the citizens still wholeheartedly back those who are driving the corruption, the country is in serious danger. \nGod help us.", "output": "0.

[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\nAccording to this report, MoD intelligence analysts became “concerned/alarmed” over a 25 October US military joint air defense exercise in the Arabian Sea that coordinated US Navy aircraft carrier defense of US Air Force transport and refueling aircraft—but that further analysis revealed was but a precursor to a much larger planned American military “event” scheduled for 14 December as part of the Pentagon’s planning for the upcoming inauguration of their next president.\nThe Pentagon’s planning for their 14 December “event”, this report continues, involves the Atlantic Ocean deployment between the United States and European Union of the aircraft carriers USS George H.W. Bush , USS George Washington and USS Abraham Lincoln whose fighter aircraft will be defending the US Air Forces’ Air Mobility Command’s ( AMC ) staggering deployment of 200 KC-135 Stratotanker air-to-air fueling aircraft, 150 C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, 150 C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and 75 C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft—all of which are “planned/scheduled” to leave the US empty, and return fully loaded.\nRaising MoD “fears/concerns” even more about this planned Pentagon “event”, this report notes, is all of the US military commanders involved in it being given copies of a cryptically written Executive Order signed by President Obama 3 days ago (4 November) that states “ global health security is a core tenet of our national strategy for countering biological threats ” and directs the US Defense Department and US Secretary of State to cooperate, coordinate and communicate with unnamed foreign defense ministries .\nWith relations between the United States and the equally globalist European Union hanging in the balance as the majority of the EU’s leaders fear a Donald Trump presidency , this report continues, many in the US are openly warning that Hillary Clinton, and the leftist forces loyal to her, are preparing to stage a “ false flag ” attack to regain their hold on power—including one of the most feared and powerful American political operatives named Roger Stone who is, likewise, openly warning it could very well happen.\nAs to why Hillary Clinton fears a Donald Trump presidency, MoD intelligence analysts in this report explain, is due to the massive exposure to the American public of her many crimes—including her cover-up of child rape and sex trafficking.\nMaking Hillary Clinton’s dire situation even worse, this report continues, was FBI Director James Comey, yesterday, basically informing her that he wasn’t prepared to indict her for her email crimes—but that US government “deep state” sources are now leaking was a “ploy/gambit” to keep President Obama from pardoning her before Donald Trump could assume the presidency.\nWith Hillary Clinton having disgraced the entire journalism profession in America for decades to come, this report says, these propagandists crimes against the citizens of US continue to astound the whole world—including the once respected television news network CNN now being proven to have colluded with Clinton to destroy Donald Trump.\nBut to one of the greatest crimes against the American people these Hillary Clinton propagandist journalists are responsible for, this report says, is their failing to tell them that her top aide, Huma Abedin, is, in fact, an imbedded spy bought and paid for by Saudi Arabia that the Federation has warned the US government about for decades.\nBut to the shockingly worse crime being committed against the American people, this report concludes, is President Obama himself now openly calling for all illegal immigrants in the United States to vote for Hillary Clinton, and pledging that the corrupt government he now controls will do nothing about it.\nAnd though not mentioned in this MoD report, there are no greater examples of how corrupt the Obama-Clinton regime has made America then the cases of a young California single mother named Mariza Reulas who is facing years in prison for the crime of selling a single supper to a member of her ladies food club and the destruction of MIT professor Cesar Hidalgo for daring to tell to the truth about Clinton’s emails—both occurring while Hillary Clinton, and all of the criminals associated with her, are still able to walk free—but if Donald Trump is allowed to survive he may be able to save, along with the United States itself.\nSource", "output": "0.

Sen. Harry Reid (D – NV) went so far as to claim the FBI has secret “explosive” evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government that it is withholding. FBI officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the Clinton campaign started publicizing around the Democratic National Convention, say they’ve turned up nothing to connect Trump and Russia , leading FBI Director James Comey to decide against making any statements to that effect. \nThe Clinton campaign has been making the allegations so long that they have taken to claiming “everyone knows” that they are true, and appears unsettled by the FBI’s refusal to sign off on the claims simply because they haven’t been able to find real evidence corroborating the story. \nThe Trump campaign has repeatedly denied ties to Russia, but that didn’t stop Clinton from calling Trump a “puppet” of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the final presidential debate. The calls have grown since Friday’s FBI report to Congress about further Clinton emails being sought. \nWith Clinton’s main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming Trump as secretly in league with the Russians would only be fair.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Recipient Email => \nFor journalists to discourage an inquisitive stance, even distrust, toward government and the elections process is astounding. But not surprising. I’m thinking of CNN journo Brian Stelter who asserted—they never argue, do they? They only ever assert—that skepticism about voting irregularities in America is “dangerous.” \nWell, a journalist decrying inquisitiveness and skepticism: Now that’s dangerous. \nStelter—he’s a danger to journalism—and the rest of the media Idiocracy like to repeat that Russian hackers (never the Stelters of the world) are undermining America’s great electoral system. I ask you: What can the Russians do to us that America’s elites have not already done? \nWhen broadcaster Lars Larson attempted to find out whether one Arcan Cetin was a citizen of the US, ICE, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told him, essentially, “Sorry, our obligation is to protect this migrant’s privacy.” \n“Who,” you ask, “is Mr. Cetin”? Cetin is a contributor to the phenomenon I term “murder-by-Muslim-immigrant.” He murdered five innocents, north of Seattle. \nArcan Cetin voted, reports Mr. Larson. But nobody at ICE was willing to tell a good citizen like our broadcaster if Cetin voted legally or not. \nAs it turned out, a sigh of relief was in order. The stellar Mr. Cetin, who, like most Muslim immigrants, voted Democrat, violated the Sixth Commandment five times, but, thank G-d, did not appear to have violated the commandment against voter fraud. Rumor has it that the murderer had been awarded citizenship, although it’s impossible to ascertain. \nThe point I’m making here is that you can rest assured voter fraud is rampant in the US as in any banana republic—and not only because an American is barred from checking whether a Muslim murderer is a fellow-citizen. But because leftists have fought down-and-dirty to bar any proof of citizenship at the time of voting. Yes, the law requires, in my state, as in most of these United States, that you be a citizen, as well as a resident of the state in which you’re voting. But you don’t always have to provide proof of citizenship when voting. \nTo vote in Washington State, as in most states, what’s needed is a driver’s license or a current State ID card . Essentially, the American voting system, thanks to the triumph of left-liberalism, is based on an honor system. \nJournalist John Fund’s research has shown that when they vote, “80 percent of non-citizens vote Democratic.” And that “6.4 percent of non-citizens voted illegally in the 2008 election.” Funds’ sources confirm that a significant number of “non-citizens register as voters” and have voted in sufficient numbers to sway elections. \nAnd when these efforts fail, the government might just step in to commit indirect voter fraud. \nFor instance, the Feds recently and wrongly granted citizenship to hundreds facing deportation, an “error” the culprits where unwilling to correct. The point is that leftists, Obama’s DOJ, in particular, have pursued every legal remedy in the book against states seeking to require proof of citizenship from voters. \nThe point is that we’re a sprawling country of competing interests, in which raw, ripe democracy has long-since usurped the old constitutional republic, where limits were placed on the power of thumping majorities. In a rank, raw democracy, where might makes right, and almost every vote is a lien against someone’s private property; voter-fraud by default is a big deal. \nDonald Trump’s supporters might be the losers in something of a rigged electoral system; but they’re certainly not stupid. \nThat’s another oft-repeated thing. Trump’s base of supporters is referred to as whites without college degrees. Again and again we hear that Mr. Trump is over-performing with white men without college degrees. The reference is intended not only as a demographic marker, but as a Mark of Cain. \nWorse has been said about this statistical cohort. Quoted in “The Trump Revolution: The Donald’s Creative Destruction Deconstructed” are Republicans and Democrats alike, maligning Trump’s Middle America as worthy of contempt. \nYou had writer Kathleen Parker hissing about Trump’s “undereducated” supporters. There was Joan Walsh, Salon editor-in-chief, proclaiming on MSNBC that she looked at those people and felt sad. “They share such a low common denominator,” groaned Joan about the “crazy, entertaining, simplistic talk” of the Trumpsters. “They’re all Republicans. … they really don’t have a firm grasp on reality,” she sneered. \nNational Journal’s Ron Brownstein had his own taxonomy for Trumpsters. “Upscale Republicans” (or those on the panel with him), vs. “blue-collar Republicans.” Nothing but “downscale whites,” derided another Democratic strategist. \nAnyhow, implicit in tethering a lack of education to Trump support is that the more educated a voter, the smarter. And the smarter the voter, the more likely he or she is to support Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. \nBut correlation, of course, is not causation. My hypothesis points to a confounding variable or factor—another variable related to both education and voting-patterns that could account for the good sense displayed by Trump supporters without college degrees. \nVoters without college or university degrees have not been institutionalized during life’s formative years. \nVoters without college or university degrees have not spent years in the tertiary school asylums. \nIn other words, many of Trump’s supporters are less likely to have been brainwashed and propagandized by the asphyxiating, postmodern, racial and gender agitprop that makes college-educated kids so insufferable and subject to group-think. \nSpending protracted time in college or university is almost guaranteed to turn-out individuals whose uniformity of opinion is as scary as its uninformed nature. \nSome support for my theory, namely that support for Trump is associated with a less propagandized population, is evident from the fact that Trump has an advantage with independents, which, as the label indicates, have a greater propensity to think outside-the-box.", "output": "0.

The only problem with that is that Voltaire doesn’t offer take-out and they never have, by policy.” The customer pitched a fit, threatened to get her “lawyer” husband involved (and did), and threatened the manager with a bad Yelp review, which she did minutes after leaving the restaurant. \nBut Voltaire’s owner responded. And it was fabulous. \nThe Yelp review: Most unfriendly and arrogant restaurant in KC. Just called Voltaire to try to order some food because we’re in a late business meeting across the street. First, they refused to answer our question about what type of broth is used in the risotto. Then they said they won’t pack food to go. My husband spoke to the manager and explained that we’re in a conference room across the street, and asked if they can pack our dinner (which we would pick up). The hostess flat-out refused to answer our question about the food or to try and work with us so we could get food in our meeting. My husband asked to speak with the manager. The manager, Jamie, said, “our food is plated beautifully, and we can’t put it in a ‘to go’ container.” So thanks, Jamie, we’ll just starve. (What the manager said is just not true by the way we’ve eaten there before, and they did pack our food to go.) When my husband said that he was going to post a Yelp review about the way the restaurant was treating us, the manager questioned, “Are you a grown man and an adult?” Yes, Jamie, we are grown adults, and we do not do business with people who behave like you do. We regularly travel to NYC and eat at a variety of restaurants, which are more than happy to accommodate people by packing food to go. This restaurant thinks they’re too good for their customers. They will soon learn that if you ignore your customers, they’re going to start ignoring you. I would not even give this place one star after this experience, and I’m dismayed by their unprofessional and arrogant behavior. \nThe owner’s response: I sincerely apologize that we don’t offer ‘take-out’ food at our restaurant. Being a Yelp user, I’m sure you were aware that on our Yelp business page, on the right side of the screen, it lists details about our establishment. There is an item listed ‘Take-Out : No.’ We have never offered take-out food as we believe the food we prepare should be presented as we see fit, (usually) on a plate inside the dining room. As for the risotto, its made with a vegetable stock – this dish is vegetarian, and I’m certain that who you were speaking with wanted to make extra certain the information provided to you was accurate. On your previous visits, you say you have witnessed dishes being boxed up as proof that we provide ‘take-out’ food. Although we do allow our guests to take their uneaten food with them in to-go boxes after they have dined with us, we have never offered ‘take-out’ food. If you were actually starving, as in a life threatening condition requiring nutritional sustenance, we would be happy to assist you..we do make exceptions for emergency situations. Our general manager did question the age/maturity of your husband after he became combative and threatened us with a negative Yelp review if we did not alter our operational practice and provide him with ‘take-out’ food. 15 minutes later you indeed came through with this threat. I can assure you that we don’t offer ‘take-out’ food because we feel we are ‘too good’ for our customers; we just prefer to have our guests dine with us, allowing for the proper presentation (and temperature) of their fare that has been skillfully prepared by our kitchen. I am very pleased that you frequent New York. We travel often as well. And I can assure you that there are many restaurants in NYC that do not offer ‘take-out’ food. Although there are many other options that do – in Kansas City as well (Go Royals!). It was made REPEATEDLY clear in the conversation with your husband that he is a lawyer. Let me provide the following analogy/role reversal-it may assist in clarifying your request. YOU: I want to hire you to handle my divorce. ME: But, I’m a tax lawyer. YOU: I don’t care I want you to handle my divorce. ME: Sorry, but I don’t practice that form of law. YOU: Just handle my divorce, I’ll pay you-it will be fine. ME: I don’t feel comfortable providing my services as a divorce lawyer, as I am a tax lawyer. You won’t receive the service you are wanting or that I am willing to provide. YOU: Well, I travel to NYC often, and in NYC, Tax lawyers handle my divorce litigation all the time. I don’t know what the problem is. I’ve told you I’m a chef, right? ME: Well, that’s nice sir, but I really can’t help you. It goes against my business practice. YOU: If you don’t represent me in my divorce, I’m going to post it all over the [most frequented social media review of lawyers] that you refused to provide me with the service I requested, and make baseless allegations about how you are very pretentious, arrogant and unprofessional. I will also try to prevent you from getting any additional business by damning you on said social media platform. Now will you represent me? ME: I don’t take kindly to threats. Thanks for your feedback. We will let you know if we decide in the future to practice divorce law, I mean, provide ‘take-out’ food. \nLet us know your thoughts at the Liberal America Facebook page .

The Guardian Reports Scientists have managed to destroy cancerous tumors by using an experimental drug derived from the seeds of a fruit found in north Queensland rainforests.\nThe drug, called EBC-46, was produced by extracting a compound from the berry of the blushwood tree, a plant only found in specific areas of the Atherton Tablelands. A single injection of the drug directly into melanoma models in the laboratory, as well as into cancers of the head, neck and colon in animals, destroyed the tumours long-term in more than 70% of cases, the study’s lead author, Dr Glen Boyle, said.\n“In preclinical trials we injected it into our models and within five minutes, you see a purpling of the area that looks like a bruise,” Boyle, from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said.\n“About 24 hours later, the tumour area goes black, a couple of days later you see a scab, and at around the 1.5 week mark, the scab falls off, leaving clean skin with no tumour there. The speed certainly surprised me.”\nResearchers believe the drug triggers a cellular response which cuts off the blood supply to the tumor by opening it up. That’s why we see a bruise-like situation forming in the tumour,” Boyle said. “This seems to lead to an activation of the body’s own immune system which then comes in and cleans up the mess.”\nIt has been used by veterinarians in about 300 cases of cancer in companion animals including dogs, cats and horses. There was no evidence EBC-46 would be effective to treat cancers that had spread to other parts of the body, known as metastatic cancers, Boyle said.\nThe drug is being developed as a human and veterinary pharmaceutical through QBiotics, a subsidiary of the company which discovered the drug, called EcoBiotics. The company is also examining the potential for a blushwood plantation. Ethical approval was recently granted for phase 1 human clinical trials, but even if those proved successful, it was unlikely the drug would replace conventional chemotherapy treatment, Boyle said.\n“Chemotherapy is still used because it is very effective for a lot of people,” he said. “But EBC-46 could perhaps be used in people who, for some reason, chemotherapy doesn’t work [for], or for elderly patients whose body can’t sustain another round of chemotherapy treatment.” The preclinical trial was funded by QIMR Berghofer and the National Health and Medical Research Council and the results were published in the journal PLOS One.\nHealthy & Natural World Reports :\nBlushwood Berries – Where they Come From Blushwood berries are the fruit of the blushwood tree, which is known to grow in only one region of the world: the rainforests of Far North Queensland, Australia. These tropical trees are not found anywhere else on the globe, but grow in abundance near Australia’s northeastern tip.\nThese particular trees need very niche conditions to thrive—conditions which can only be found in specific portions of Far North Queensland, Australia. Considering their usefulness as proven by the latest cancer research published in PLOS One , some are wondering if they could be grown in a greenhouse environment, so that people all over the world could benefit from their cancer-killing properties.\nBlushwood Berries – What kind of Cancer they Eradicate The researchers at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, headed by Dr. Glen Boyle, used an experimental drug produced from the seeds of blushwood berries called EBC-46. They used this drug to treat spots of melanoma (the most deadly form of skin cancer) on dogs, cats and horses.\nThe subjects were diagnosed by veterinarians and given a poor prognosis, most being considered candidates for euthanasia prior to participating in the study. Amazingly, these animals that had been on death’s door prior to the study had their melanoma tumors disappear after treatment in the lab by Dr. Boyle and his team of scientists.\nTumors were Gone within 48 Hours When the EBC-46 was injected into the cancerous cells on the subjects, the tumors reacted by turning a dark color, then falling off. The derivative from the blushwood berry is thought to cut off oxygen supply to the cancer cells, allowing for the removal of tumors without the need for surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy.\nThe researchers reported that most of the subjects’ tumors—previously considered a lost cause by veterinarians—were gone within 48 hours of being injected with EBC-46. Under the microscope, the individual cancer cells began shriveling up and dying within mere moments of coming into contact with the EBC-46.", "output": "0. Fake"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Email \nJust when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails “did not come from her private server”, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the “emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry”, and according to some reports there may be “potentially thousands” of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? \nLet’s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN … \nAfter recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that “appear to be pertinent” to the email probe. \n“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,” Comey wrote the chairmen. “I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” \nAt this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton’s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton’s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered … \nWe don’t know what this means yet except that it’s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that’s where we are… \nIs it a certainty that we won’t learn before the election? I’m not sure it’s a certainty we won’t learn before the election. \nOne thing is, it’s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her… \nIf the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? \nIt is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. \nSo those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. \nBut if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason… \nIf Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \nDNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. \nBut the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. \nIt would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. \nIn such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be “fair” until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. \nMeanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. \nAnd CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November… \nAn artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. \nMogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. \nThe AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. \nWithout Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. \nSo if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. \nAt this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen. \nTake a look at the future of America: The Beginning of the End and then prepare", "output": "0.

But he said he wanted to release the video so the public could see a more complete picture of what officers faced as they confronted Noble and had to make decisions in mere seconds.Dyer told reporters he had originally planned to release the names of both officers, but he declined to do so Wednesday because the department s legal counsel instructed him not to. The department has intercepted several threats made against the officers involved, although not by name. He noted that the recent shooting of 12 police officers in Dallas has caused him to fear for the safety of his own officers, especially given the controversy swirling around Noble s death.He said the officer driving the patrol car was a 20-year veteran at the department. In a second unit was an officer with 17 years of experience   10 with the department. The 20-year veteran had never been a part of a police shooting, but the 17-year officer was involved in a 2009 shooting.Dyer said the officers had interviewed a person who had called 911 about an armed man walking around the area. About 12 minutes later, they encountered Noble s truck.The videos pick up from there.The cameras capture what sounds like screeching tires. One officer notes that Noble was  peeling out.  They then attempt to stop Noble, who continues to drive for some time before pulling into the gas station at Shields and Armstrong avenues.Although some of the road had no-stopping zones to Noble s right, Dyer said Noble had several opportunities to pull over.The officer behind the wheel pulls out his handgun and points it at Noble s truck as it is slowing and turning into the gas station. Dyer said this was because the officer believed Noble may have been armed, given the officers  initial call. That officer also believed Noble was taunting him and making the officer feel as if he did have a gun, Dyer added.Both officers exit their vehicles with guns drawn. They begin yelling for the driver to put both of his hands outside of the driver s side window of his truck. Noble puts his left hand out of the window but not his right, despite multiple requests for him to do so.After some time, Noble begins to exit the truck. One officer yells that he did not tell Noble to get out of the truck. Noble appears to stagger as he gets out of the lifted truck. He then walks a few steps away from the officers, who move toward him. The officers repeatedly tell Noble to put both of his hands up. He continues to walk toward and away from officers in a circular way   raising and lowering each hand at different intervals.Dyer said that one officer believed Noble had something in his hand. This was later determined to be a 4-inch-by-4-inch piece of clear plastic with what appears to be a grayish clay inside.

Benghazi information was compromised by Ms. Mills but it would be asking too much to expect her to come clean on it. Truth just isn t in the cards for any of these lowlifes.WASHINGTON When Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, her staff scrutinized politically sensitive documents requested under public-records law and sometimes blocked their release, according to people with direct knowledge of the activities.In one instance, her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, told State Department records specialists she wanted to see all documents requested on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, and later demanded that some be held back.In another case, Ms. Mills s staff negotiated with the records specialists over the release of documents about former President Bill Clinton s speaking engagements also holding some back.The records requests came under the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, the public s main tool to get information from the government. Decisions on what to release belong with each agency s FOIA staff, say experts on the law, to guard against the withholding of documents for political or other inappropriate reasons.Questions about the transparency of Mrs. Clinton s State Department tenure have been bubbling ever since it was revealed that she exclusively used a private email account to conduct her work as secretary. The existence of that private system, which is being investigated by a House special committee probing the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, meant the department didn t have access to her emails when public requests to see them came in.Read more: WSJ", "output": "0.

I’d be open to a range of options to do that. But we have to be careful that the R version passes which begins the unraveling of the ACA.” Do you still have any doubts? Sadly, there are those who have benefited from the ACA, but to a greater extent, many have seen the exact opposite of what was promised.

How many millions have they raked in on this deal and bilked the American people for in Obamacare penalties because they can’t afford the “affordable” health care?

Well, yesterday on PBS’ Nevada Week In Review , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) was asked whether his goal was to move Obamacare to a single-payer system. His answer? “Yes, yes. Absolutely, yes.” The plan to undermine your health and sufficiency is so diabolical and disgusting, that many would simply refuse to believe such a thing. Well, there it is folks.

According to Rannazzisi’s LinkedIn profile, as Chief of Diversion, he had been tasked with “oversight and control of all regulatory compliance inspections and civil and criminal investigations of approximately 1.6 million DEA registrants”— but if the standards are lowered by Congress to allow greater leeway in prescribing opioids, the threshold of criminality is raised. \nAs the Guardian points out, legislation to fight the opioid epidemic, Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act , did, in fact, pass in July — but partisan controversy erupted when Republicans failed to provide funding to give the law sharp teeth. Democrats then issued a report titled “ Dying Waiting for Treatment ” in response, which “likened the Republican response to the opioid crisis to ‘using a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam.’” \nIndeed the report sharply criticized the bill, equating its policies to ‘empty promises’ for the lack of financial follow-through. \nAs the Washington Post detailed in a report earlier this month, the DEA launched an aggressive campaign to rein in distribution of opioids by pharmaceutical manufacturers to illegal ‘pill mills’ and corrupt pharmacies, who cared little whether the drugs wound up on the streets. \nHeaded by Rannazzisi, the Office of Diversion Control sent investigators into the field, and began issuing hefty fines and filing lawsuits against the distributors responsible for the proliferation of opioids on the streets. \nBut the disproportionately powerful pharmaceutical industry — fearing a potential significant loss in profits — fought back. Hard. \nAccording to the Post , the deputy attorney general summoned Rannazzisi to a meeting in 2012, concerning the cases of two unnamed major drug companies. \n“That meeting was to chastise me for going after industry, and that’s all that meeting was about,” the now-retired DEA official told the Post . \nThen, in 2014, came what constituted a hand out to the pharmaceutical industry by the Department of Justice and congressional legislators: the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act — legislation initiated by the Healthcare Distribution Management Association — the industry group representing distributors at the heart of the controversy. \nAn analysis of lobbying records by the Post found “the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, spent $13 million lobbying House and Senate members and their staffs on the legislation and other issues between 2014 and 2016.” \nRannazzisi argued his case to congressional staffers in a phone conference in July 2014, and recalled telling them, “This bill passes the way it’s written we won’t be able to get immediate suspension orders, we won’t be able to stop the hemorrhaging of these drugs out of these bad pharmacies and these bad corporations.” \nStunned at the massive — and ultimately successful — effort to take the bite out of DEA attempts to hold distributors and drugmakers responsible for their role in an epidemic estimated to take 19,000 lives every year, Rannazzisi likened the legislation to a “free pass” for legal drug pushers. \n“This doesn’t ensure patient access and it doesn’t help drug enforcement at all,” he told the Guardian. “What this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process. What this bill does is take away DEA’s ability to go after a pharmacist, a wholesaler, manufacturer or distributor.” \n“This was a gift. A gift to the industry,” he added. \nAfter heading the diversion office for a decade, Rannazzisi retired in 2015 — likely disgusted over legislators’ dedication to the legal drug industry, rather than the people whose interests they’re ostensibly obligated to protect. \n“The bill passed because ‘Big Pharma’ wanted it to pass,” he told the Guardian in no uncertain terms. “The DEA is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency. When I was in charge what I tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and they’re not going to like being regulated.” \nBig Pharma relies overwhelmingly on lobbyists filling the coffers of politicians to ensure they ignore the crisis gripping the nation. As the Center for Public Integrity found , the Guardian noted, Purdue Pharma — at the heart of the epidemic for its highly-addictive drug introduced in the late 1990s, OxyContin — spent a breathtaking $740 million in the last ten years on congressional lobbying efforts. \nHowever, Big Pharma’s power to influence policy and legislation extends far beyond simple but effective lobbying — the government-run Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC) has been accused by Sen. Ron Wyden of being a tool to “weaken” CDC guidelines for limiting overprescribing of opioids. \nWyden wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell of his concerns the IPRCC had been staffed with ‘experts’ with conflicts of interest for their close ties to Big Pharma, including a scientist with a $1.5 million endowment from Purdue, reported the Guardian . \n“You’ve got a panel that’s certainly got a fair number of people that have a vested interest in this problem of overprescribing. That’s something you’ve got to root out,” Wyden asserted . “The role of the pharmaceutical companies on these advisory panels troubles me greatly. Science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interests.” \nFamilies of countless addicts and victims of the opioid industry would undoubtedly find the direct influence of Big Pharma’s pro-opioid cash appalling — yet it continues to this day. Policies and legislation have not yet been given the appropriate funding needed to effectively combat the problem, which swirls out of control while politicians and drugmakers reap blood-tainted profits. \n“Corporations have no conscience,” Rannazzisi flatly told the Guardian . “Unfortunately, with my job, I was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids. If one of those CEOs went out there and talked to anybody, or if one of those CEOs happened to lose a kid to this horrible, horrible domestic tragedy we have, I’d bet you they’d change their mind. \n“When you sit with a parent who can’t understand why there’s so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace, and why isn’t the government doing anything, well the DEA was doing something.

Today, Democrats have announced they are drawing up the impeachment papers. Pope Francis appealed to President Trump to reconsider his decision so as not to offend anyone. In his appeal, Pope Francis said,  Jerusalem is a unique city, sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims who venerate the holy places of their respective religions, and has a special vocation to peace.   And yawn in Gaza, where the more things change, the more they stay the same, Palestinians burned the U.S. and Israeli flags.The media will try to make everyone believe that Palestinians loved us when Obama was President, even though there is no truth to that fantasy. (See image below)Daily Mail   President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that America formally recognizes Jerusalem as Israel s capital city, changing decades of U.S. policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve, not derail, aspirations for regional peace.Appearing in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room against an elaborate backdrop of Christmas decorations, He also said the United States embassy in Israel would, over time, be moved there from Tel Aviv.Israel is the only country where the United States has an embassy in a city that the host nation does not consider its capital. I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,  Trump said.  While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today I am delivering. When I came into office I promised to look at the world s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking,  he said, leaning heavily on a mid-1990s federal law that demanded the embassy s relocation. We have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital   at all,  Trump added.  But today we finally acknowledge the obvious, that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It is something that has to be done. Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon seems to think so. Continetti wrote the best piece on Trump s bold decision to move the embassy that we have seen to date.Not only is President Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and begin the process of moving the U.S. embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency. It is one of the boldest moves any U.S. president has made since the beginning of the Oslo  peace process  in 1993. That process collapsed at Camp David in 2000 when Yasir Arafat rejected President Clinton s offer of a Palestinian state. And the process has been moribund ever since, despite multiple attempts to restart it.That is why the warnings from Trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow. There is no peace process to wreck. The conflict is frozen. And the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in U.S. or Israeli policy but in Palestinian autocracy, corruption, and incitement. Have the former Obama administration officials decrying Trump s announcement read a newspaper lately? From listening to them, you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the Middle East but for Trump. In fact, the region is engulfed in war, terrorism, poverty, and despotism; Israel faces threats in the north and south; its sworn enemy, Iran, is growing in influence and reach; and the delegitimization of the Jewish State proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses. I forget how the Obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring Israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Maybe someone will remind me.A similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over Jerusalem. Every Israeli knows Jerusalem was, is, and will remain his capital. Every recent president has agreed with him. And the U.S. consensus has been bipartisan. The last four Democratic platforms have said the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. The Senate voted 90-0 only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city. Were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote? Was it all virtue-signaling, a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of U.S. diplomacy?It is a sign of the disingenuousness of American foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning. President Trump has no background in or admiration for the routines, manners, and norms of the U.S. foreign service, especially that part of it which specializes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid: Jerusalem is Israel s capital, full stop. His transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition. In March 2016, at the AIPAC policy conference, he pledged that  We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.  His remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the pro-Israel community.I wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of U.S. law as  disruptive.  Have they not paid attention to this man? Donald Trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the U.S. capital for decades. In this sense, his Jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm. He is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion. What Trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one. By keeping his campaign promise today, he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the United States could have its cake and eat it too on the question of Israel s capital. And by moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the United States will acknowledge Israel s right to determine its own capital city. That is not something to condemn or fear. It is something to be proud of.", "output": "0. Fake"}

The ghosts of Hillary s defeat continue to haunt the halls of Washington and media headlines, as party operatives and their media surrogates conjure up old plots, as well as new and innovative ways to change the election results.Since Hillary Clinton s devastating defeat at the hands of underdog Republican nominee, and now President-Elect, Donald Trump, both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party leadership have been desperately trying to claw-back the election result, or at least damage and delegitimize the incoming Trump Administration. After blaming FBI Director James Comey for Clinton s loss, party operatives, in conjunction with George Soros-backed MoveOn.org, then went on to organize street protests which turned into riots, before backing Green Party leader Jill Stein in her frantic attempt to stage a voter recount in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania   all designed to somehow reverse, or discredit Trump s historic presidential win.The only problem with this leg of the Establishment s subscribed conspiracy theory   is that it is based on a lie. Media hype aside   there is no actual evidence, beyond speculation that Russia hacked US Elections, or even hacked Clinton chief of staff John Podesta s emails posted on Wikileaks. That lie is evident right there plain sight, as Democratic Party leaders falsely state that the CIA has concluded the  Russians  hacked or interfered in the US Presidential election. The CIA never concluded anything, they simply said  the Russians probably did it.

(see full letter below).Despite the lack of any actual proof, the same Clinton media operatives that skewed campaign coverage, polling in their candidate s favor, and who also fabricated Trump scandals throughout the election   are now running a hysterical PR campaign  are pushing the Russian hacking conspiracy theory  with absolutely no proof to substantiate their incredible claims.Desperate to rescue his collapsed reputation, John Podesta, along with Democrat minority leader Nancy Pelosi (image, left) are now lobbying the CIA to release  evidence  it doesn t actually have   and give it to state delegate voters in the US Electoral College before they cast their official Presidential votes on December 19th.It seems as if disgraced party operative Podesta might just be digging a deeper hole for himself and his party The HillMore Democratic electors are joining the call for an intelligence briefing on Russian interference in the presidential election before they cast their votes for president on Monday.Twenty-nine electors now are pressuring Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to disclose more information about the CIA s conclusion that Russian interference helped sway the election in President-elect Donald Trump s favor.On Monday, 10 electors   spearheaded by Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.)   wrote an open letter to Clapper, demanding more information ahead of next week s vote. The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations,  the letter reads.  We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States. Twenty-eight Democrats and one Republican have now signed the letter.On Monday, the Clinton campaign voiced support for the effort. Each day that month, our campaign decried the interference of Russia in our campaign and its evident goal of hurting our campaign to aid Donald Trump,  said John Podesta, Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman, in a statement.  Despite our protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign. We now know that the CIA has determined Russia s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American.

He has declared that the United States now officially recognizes the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and announced plans to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city.The only problem is, the city isn t just holy to the country of Israel.While Trump indicated that he wasn t  taking a position  on any contested land, that s really a misleading statement, since declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in effect gives the city to the Israelis, a position that essentially declares the debate on who all of the land belongs to over.Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator in the peace process, was quick to respond, saying that Trump had  destroyed any possibility of peace  and that he was  pushing this region towards chaos [and] violence. Mustafa Marghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, told Al-Jazeera that: This is not a single act. This US administration that did not speak even once about a two-state solution. This American administration did not say or mention the words  Palestinian state  once. This American administration has failed to exercise any pressure on Israel on the issue of settlements, although Israel has enhanced settlement activities in the occupied territories by no less than 100 percent since President Trump was elected. Many expect to see outrage across the Middle East as news of the decision comes in.The European Union, for their part, insists that their position has not changed, and issued a statement almost immediately declaring that they intended to continue working toward recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of two distinct states   Israel AND Palestine.Just as he does here at home, Trump seems to be uniting people against him, even some that seem to be unlikely pairings. Both the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and King Abdullah II of Jordan warned that ignoring the Palestinian, Muslim, and Christian rights in Jerusalem will only fuel further extremism and undermine the war against terrorism. But the decision does make Trump s evangelical supporters in America happy. Their desire to hasten the end of days has been a constant source of bafflement for those seeking to understand the strange relationship between the Jewish state and evangelicalism. According to Christian traditions, the Jews will all die in the Apocalypse, as will everyone who doesn t share their specific beliefs.No wonder they re mostly Republicans.Watch Trump s announcement here:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", "output": "0.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: We Are Change \nOne day after Julian Assange officially revealed for the first time that the source of hacked Podesta and DNC emails in Wikileaks’ possession is not Russia, in the second excerpt from the John Pilger Special, to be broadcast by RT on Saturday Julian Assange accuses Hillary Clinton of misleading Americans about the true scope of Islamic State’s support from Washington’s Middle East allies.\nAs previously reported, in an August 17, 2014 email made public WikiLeaks last month, Hillary Clinton, who had served as secretary of state until the year before, urges John Podesta, then an advisor to Barack Obama, to “bring pressure” on Qatar and Saudi Arabia, “which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIS and other radical Sunni groups.”\n“I think this is the most significant email in the whole collection,” Assange, whose whistle-blowing site released three tranches of Clinton-related emails over the past year, told Pilger in the interview.\n“All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some “rogue” princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.” \nAs recounted by RT , Assange and Pilger, who sat down for their 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where the whistleblower has been a refugee since 2012, also talked about the conflict of interest between Clinton’s official post, her husband’s nonprofit, and the Middle East officials, whose stated desire to fight terrorism may not have been sincere.\nJohn Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia.\nJulian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton – and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it – the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value.\nJP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation?\nJA: Yes.\nThe conversation then turns to the imminent presidential election: Pilger questioned Assange over increasingly frequent accusations from the Clinton camp, and Western media, that WikiLeaks is looking to swing next week’s US presidential election in favor of Donald Trump – perhaps at Russia’s behest.\nHowever, just as he did last week, Assange again dismissed the prospect of Trump, who is almost tied in the polls, winning as unlikely, and not necessarily due to his standing with the electorate.\n‘Trump won’t be permitted to win’ “My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment,” said Assange. “Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.”\nJP: The accusations that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians and you hear people saying, “Well, why doesn’t WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia?” \nJA: We have published over 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical. And… a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. And our documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases, refugee cases of people fleeing some kinds of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up.\nJP: Do you take yourself a view of the US election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? \nJA: Donald Trump – what does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American “white trash,” deplorable and irredeemable. Basically, the same thing. It means, from a… establishment or educated, cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are, you know, like the rednecks, and you can’t… like, they are just… you can never deal with them. And because he so clearly – through his words and actions and the type of people that turns up at his rallies – represents the people who are not the upper-middle-class-educated, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with that, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting in any way Trump, including criticizing Clinton. And if you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, it makes absolute sense.\nHe is right, but the same was said about Brexit. \nSources; http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-04/julian-assange-says-trump-wont-be-allowed-win-clinton-and-isis-are-funded-same-money \nhttps://www.rt.com/news/365405-assange-pilger-full-transcript/ \nFollow WE ARE CHANGE on SOCIAL MEDIA SnapChat: LukeWeAreChange \nfbook: https://facebook.com/LukeWeAreChange \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Lukewearechange I nstagram: http://instagram.com/lukewearechange Sign up become a patron and Show your support for alternative news for Just 1$ a month you can help Grow We are change We use Bitcoin Too ! 12HdLgeeuA87t2JU8m4tbRo247Yj5u2TVP Join and Up Vote Our STEEMIT The post Julian Assange Says Trump Won’t Be Allowed To Win, “Clinton And ISIS Are Funded By The Same Money” appeared first on We Are Change .", "output": "0.

It was Obama s green energy scam with companies like Solyndra that was like flushing millions and billions down the toilet Taxpayers are on the hook for more than $2.2 billion in expected costs from the federal government s energy loan guarantee programs, according to a new audit Monday that suggests the controversial projects may not pay for themselves, as officials had promised.Nearly $1 billion in loans have already defaulted under the Energy Department program, which included the infamous Solyndra stimulus project and dozens of other green technology programs the Obama administration has approved, totaling nearly about $30 billion in taxpayer backing, the Government Accountability Office reported in its audit.The hefty $2.2 billion price tag is actually an improvement over initial estimates, which found the government was poised to face $4 billion in losses from the loan guarantees. But as the projects have come to fruition, they ve performed better, leaving taxpayers with a shrinking   though still sizable   liability. As of November 2014, DOE estimates the credit subsidy cost of the loans and loan guarantees in its portfolio   that is, the total expected net cost over the life of the loans   to be $2.21 billion, including $807 million for loans that have defaulted,  the GAO said in its report to Congress.The green program loan guarantees were created in a 2005 law and boosted by the 2009 stimulus. The first applications were approved in 2009, and through 2014 the Obama administration had issued some 38 loans and guarantees, covering 34 projects ranging from nuclear power plants to fuel-efficient vehicles to solar panels and wind-generation technology.Read more: Washington Times", "output": "0.

That s why the Wells Fargo investigation is so important.  Last week s Senate Banking Committee hearing with Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf raised serious questions that demand additional answers and point to potential individual wrongdoing  We are not in a position to determine if any of the senior executives at Wells Fargo committed criminal conduct.  That is ultimately the job of the Justice Department and courts.  But these facts raise questions about whether senior executives, including Mr. Stumpf, knowingly allowed illegal conduct to continue.Senators who signed the letter are Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, Dick Durbin, Al Franken, Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono, Angus King, Amy Klobuchar, Patrick Leahy, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Ron Wyden.Twelve Democrats and two Independents. Not a single Republican signed the letter.The letter states that Stumpf knew as early as 2013 that employees were opening up the illegal accounts but failed to disclose the information to investors and instead used the illegal accounts as a way to inflate stock prices. In other words, Stumpf was committing fraud.The end of the letter praises the actions taken by Warren s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but it still holds out hope that the DOJ will investigate executives personally:While the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency settlements in this case are a good first step toward providing restitution to Wells Fargo s customers, they are no substitute for a thorough Justice Department investigation into potential wrongdoing by senior executives at the bank.  We hope the Department follows through on its promise in the Yates memo and brings all the resources it has to bear on investigating the conduct of Wells Fargo s senior leadership.Sanders wrote a letter to regulators earlier, asking if any investigations against the executives personally were being conducted, saying,  Wall Street won t change until we make it clear that no bank is too big to fail and no CEO is too big to jail. So far, his questions remain unanswered. Hopefully, the letter sent by these progressive senators doesn t go unanswered.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images", "output": "0. Fake"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: This is a must read for anyone who s undecided or plans on voting for a third party candidate It covers all the bases and cements for you the duty as an American to do what s best for our nation. If you are already a Trump supporter, this will reaffirm your support. It s not just for Christians but for ALL Americans who love this Country Read on and commit to electing Donald J. Trump to be the 45th President of the United States Some of my Christian friends tell me they can t in good conscience vote for Donald Trump because, when faced with a choice between  the lesser of two evils,  the morally right thing is to choose neither one. They recommend voting for a third-party or write-in candidate.As a professor who has taught Christian ethics for 39 years, I think their analysis is incorrect. Now that Trump has won the GOP nomination, I think voting for Trump is a morally good choice.American citizens need patience with each other in this difficult political season. Close friends are inevitably going to make different decisions about the election. We still need to respect each other and thank God that we live in a democracy with freedom to differ about politics. And we need to keep talking with each other   because democracies function best when thoughtful citizens can calmly and patiently dialog about the reasons for their differences. This is my contribution to that discussion.A good candidate with flawsI do not think that voting for Donald Trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a flawed candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent. In fact, it is the morally right thing to do.I did not support Trump in the primary season. I even spoke against him at a pastors  conference in February. But now I plan to vote for him. I do not think it is right to call him an  evil candidate.  I think rather he is a good candidate with flaws.He is egotistical, bombastic, and brash. He often lacks nuance in his statements. Sometimes he blurts out mistaken ideas (such as bombing the families of terrorists) that he later must abandon. He insults people. He can be vindictive when people attack him. He has been slow to disown and rebuke the wrongful words and actions of some angry fringe supporters. He has been married three times and claims to have been unfaithful in his marriages. These are certainly flaws, but I don t think they are disqualifying flaws in this election.On the other hand, I think some of the accusations hurled against him are unjustified. His many years of business conduct show that he is not racist or anti-(legal) immigrant or anti-Semitic or misogynistic   I think these are unjust magnifications by a hostile press exaggerating some careless statements he has made. I think he is deeply patriotic and sincerely wants the best for the country. He has been an unusually successful problem solver in business. He has raised remarkable children. Many who have known him personally speak highly of his kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity. But the main reason I call him  a good candidate with flaws  is that I think most of the policies he supports are those that will do the most good for the nation.Seek the good of the nationShould Christians even try to influence elections at all? Yes, definitely. The apostle Peter says Christians are  exiles  on this earth (1 Peter 1:1). Therefore I take seriously the prophet Jeremiah s exhortation to the Jewish people living in exile in Babylon: Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare  (Jeremiah 29:7).By way of modern application, I think Christians today have a similar obligation to vote in such a way that will  seek the welfare  of the United States. Therefore the one overriding question to ask is this: Which vote is most likely to bring the best results for the nation?If this election is close (which seems likely), then if someone votes for a write-in candidate instead of voting for Trump, this action will directly help Hillary Clinton, because she will need one less vote to win. Therefore the question that Christians should ask is this: Can I in good conscience act in a way that helps a liberal like Hillary Clinton win the presidency?Under President Obama, a liberal federal government has seized more and more control over our lives. But this can change. This year we have an unusual opportunity to defeat Hillary Clinton and the pro-abortion, pro-gender-confusion, anti-religious liberty, tax-and-spend, big government liberalism that she champions. I believe that defeating that kind of liberalism would be a morally right action. Therefore I feel the force of the words of James:  Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin  (James 4:17).Some may feel it is easier just to stay away from this messy Trump-Clinton election, and perhaps not even vote. But the teachings of Scripture do not allow us to escape moral responsibility by saying that we decided to do nothing. The prophet Obadiah rebuked the people of the Edom for standing by and doing nothing to help when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem:  On the day that you stood aloof, on the day that . . . foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.  (Obadiah 1:11).I am writing this article because I doubt that many  I can t vote for Trump  Christians have understood what an entirely different nation would result from Hillary Clinton as president, or have analyzed in detail how different a Trump presidency would be. In what follows, I will compare the results we could expect from a Clinton presidency with what we could expect from a Trump presidency.The Supreme Court with Clinton as presidentHillary Clinton would quickly replace Justice Scalia with another liberal like Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. This would give liberals a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court even without Justice Kennedy, and 6-3 when he votes with them.But that is not all. Justice Ginsburg is 83, and she has had colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and has a heart stent. Justice Kennedy is 80. Justice Breyer is 78. A President Clinton could possibly nominate three or four justices to the Supreme Court, locking in a far-left activist judiciary for perhaps 30 or more years. She could also add dozens of activist judges to federal district courts and courts of appeals, the courts where 99% of federal lawsuits are decided. Judicial tyranny of the type we have seen when abortion rights and same-sex marriage were forced on the nation would gain a permanent triumph.The nation would no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree. And there would be nothing in our system of government that anyone could do to stop them.That is why this election is not just about Hillary Clinton. It is about defeating the far left liberal agenda that any Democratic nominee would champion. Liberal Democrats are now within one Supreme Court justice of their highest goal: gaining permanent control of the nation with a five vote majority on the Supreme Court, and then relentlessly imposing every liberal policy on the nation not through winning elections but through a relentless parade of one Supreme Court decision after another.Even if Clinton were to drop out of the race (perhaps due to additional shocking email disclosures, for example), our choice in the election would be just the same, because any other Democratic nominee would appoint the same kind of liberal justices to the Court.AbortionOn abortion, a liberal court would probably find the ban on partial-birth abortion to be unconstitutional (it was upheld by only a 5-4 majority in Gonzalez v. Carhart, 2007). In addition, the court could find an absolute  right to abortion  in the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and then sweep away with one decision most or all of the restrictions on abortion that pro-life advocates worked for tirelessly over the last 43 years, including ultrasound requirements, waiting periods, parental consent requirements, and prohibitions on non-doctors performing abortions.Voters should not doubt the power of the Supreme Court to abolish all these laws restricting abortions. Think of the power of the Obergefell v. Hodges 5-4 decision in June, 2015. It instantly nullified all the work that thousands of Christians had done over many years in persuading the citizens of 31 states to pass constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. But no one is campaigning for such laws or amendments anymore, because it would be futile. The Supreme Court has spoken, and therefore the issue is settled in the political system of the United States. We lost   not at the ballot box, but because we had a liberal Supreme Court that nullified the democratic process regarding the definition of marriage.So it would certainly be with any efforts to place legal limitations on abortion. Nobody would campaign any more for laws to limit abortions, because any such laws would be unconstitutional. The legislative lobbying work of pro-life advocacy groups would be totally and utterly defeated. Millions of unborn children would continue to die.Religious libertyThe current liberal agenda often includes suppressing Christian opposition to its views. So a liberal court would increasingly nullify rights of conscience with respect to forced participation in same-sex marriage ceremonies or expressing moral objections to homosexual conduct. Already Christians are being pushed out of many occupations. Florists, bakers, and professional photographers have had their businesses destroyed by large fines for refusal to contribute their artistic talents to a specific event, a same-sex wedding ceremony to which they had moral objections.Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran in Atlanta was removed from his job because of self-publishing a religious book that briefly mentioned the Bible s teachings regarding non-marital sexual conduct, including homosexuality, amidst a host of other topics. His situation holds ominous implications for any Christians who hold public sector jobs. In our military services, many high-ranking officers have quietly been forced to resign because they were unwilling to give support to the homosexual agenda.Mozilla/Firefox CEO Brendan Eich was pushed out from his own company merely because he had donated money to Proposition 8 in California, supporting marriage between one man and one woman. This event has troubling implications for Christians in any corporate executive role who dare to support a political position contrary to the liberal agenda.Last year Boston urologist Paul Church, a Harvard Medical School faculty member, lost his hospital privileges at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center because he had expressed concerns about the medical dangers associated with same-sex activity.Are my predictions about this kind of loss of religious liberty too grim? The three conservative justices still on the Supreme Court expressed similar concerns just last month. The case concerned a Washington pharmacy that has been owned for 70 years by the Stormans family, who are committed Christians. They will likely now be put out of business by the Washington State Pharmacy Board for refusing to dispense an abortion-causing prescription drug. On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court refused to hear the Stormans  appeal, in spite of the strong dissent written by Justice Alito (joined by Roberts and Thomas): At issue are Washington State regulations that are likely to make a pharmacist unemployable if he or she objects on religious grounds to dispensing certain prescription medications. . . . . there is much evidence that the impetus for the adoption of the regulations was hostility to pharmacists whose religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception are out of step with prevailing opinion in the State . . . . If this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern.  (italics added)Christian business ownersIf Clinton appoints just one more liberal justice, it is likely that many Christian business owners will be targeted. Hobby Lobby won its 2014 Supreme Court case (again 5-4), so it was not compelled to dispense abortifacients to its employees, but that case could be reversed (the four liberal justices in the minority, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, are still on the court). If that case is overturned, it would force Hobby Lobby out of business, because the Green family had said they would shut down the company of 23,000 employees and over $3 billion in annual sales if they lost the decision. The implications for other Christian business owners with pro-life convictions are ominous.These incidents show that it is not an exaggeration to say that, under a liberal Supreme Court resulting from Hillary Clinton s election, Christians would increasingly experience systematic exclusion from hundreds of occupations, with thousands of people losing their jobs. Step-by-step, Christians would increasingly be marginalized to the silent fringes of society. Is withholding a vote from Donald Trump important enough to pay this high a price in loss of freedom?Some Christians have even hinted to me that  persecution would be good for us.  But the Bible never encourages us to seek persecution or hope for it. We should rather work to prevent such oppression of Christians, just as Jesus taught us to pray,  Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil  (Matthew 6:13). Paul did not encourage us to pray that God would give us bad rulers but good ones who would allow us to live a peaceful life: I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.  (1Timothy 2:1)Christian schools and collegesA liberal Supreme Court would also impact education. Christian colleges would likely be found guilty of  discrimination  if they required adherence to the Bible s standards regarding sexual conduct, or even required affirmation of primary Christian beliefs. Campus ministries like Cru and InterVarsity have already been forced off of many university campuses following the 5-4 Supreme Court decision CLS v. Martinez (2010), which upheld the exclusion of the Christian Legal Society from the campus of Hastings College of Law in San Francisco. And now California s Equity in Higher Education Act (SB 1146), which recently passed the California state senate and will likely become law, would prohibit Christian colleges from requiring students or employees to hold Christian beliefs or abide by biblical moral standards regarding sexual conduct, and would prohibit colleges from assigning housing based on a student s biological sex if a student claimed to be transgender. Colleges like Biola and Azusa Pacific could not long survive under those regulations.With regard to elementary and high schools, laws promoting school choice or tuition voucher programs would likely be declared unconstitutional if they allowed such funding to go to Christian schools. A tax credit program for scholarships to private schools, including Christian institutions, was only upheld by a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn in 2011, and all four liberal justices who voted against it are still on the court. Another possible target of the liberal agenda would be laws that allow for home schooling, if the secular/ liberal governmental hostility to home schooling in European countries is any indicator.ChurchesChurches would not be exempt from the impact of a liberal Supreme Court. The court could rule that any school district is allowed to ban churches from renting school buildings on Sundays, an action that could severely hinder the work of small churches and church planting in general. (This was already the ruling of the Second Circuit in the Bronx Household of Faith case regarding New York City public schools.) And some churches in Iowa have now been told that they have to make their bathrooms open to people on the basis of their  gender identity  if the churches are going to be open to the public at all.Freedom of speechFreedom of speech would be increasingly restricted in the public square. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that prayers of visiting pastors who prayed  in Jesus  name  when they opened a city council meeting were allowed under the Constitution, but again it was a 5-4 decision (Town of Greece v. Galloway) and all four liberals who wanted to restrict such prayers are still on the court.Criminalizing dissentAnother troubling possibility is that liberal activists, once in power, would further entrench themselves by criminalizing much political dissent. We have already seen it happen with the IRS targeting of conservative groups and with some state attorneys general taking steps to prosecute (!) groups who dare to disagree with activists  claims about the danger of man-made global warming. But my conscience won t let me vote for Donald Trump,  some have told me. But I wonder if their consciences have considered the gravity of these destructive consequences that would come from a Clinton presidency. A vote for Trump would at least be doing something to prevent these things.In addition, I think there are several positive reasons to vote for Trump.The Supreme Court with Trump as presidentTrump has released a list of 11 judges to show the kind of nominee he would appoint to the Supreme Court. A lawyer familiar with many of these names has told me that they constitute a  dream list  of outstanding judges who would uphold the original meaning of the Constitution and would not create new laws from the bench. Trump has said he would rely primarily on advice from the Federalist Society, the organization that promotes the  original meaning  view so strongly exemplified by Justice Scalia before his death.If Trump would appoint a replacement for Scalia from his list of 11, and probably one or two other Supreme Court justices, then we could see a 5-4 or even 6-3 majority of conservative justices on the Supreme Court. The results for the nation would be overwhelmingly good.Such a Supreme Court would finally return control of the nation to the people and their elected representatives, removing it from dictatorial judges who repeatedly make law from the bench.AbortionSuch a court would likely overturn Roe v. Wade and return abortion laws and the regulation of abortion to the states.Religious libertyA conservative court would vigorously uphold the First Amendment, protecting freedom of religion and freedom of speech for Christian colleges, Christian ministries, and churches.Such a court would likely overturn the horribly destructive decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) that changed the meaning of the First Amendment and ruled that a government action  must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion  (note: not a specific denomination but  religion  in general). A conservative court would likely declare that the First Amendment was only intended to prohibit the establishment of a state-sponsored church or denomination.Such a decision would once again allow the nonsectarian affirmation of personal belief in God in public schools, would once again allow coaches to pray with their football teams before a game, and would allow visiting clergy to be invited to give a prayer at high school graduation ceremonies. It would also imply that nativity scenes without Santa Claus and Buddha should be allowed in government-owned parks and buildings at Christmas time. It wouldn t require these things, but would allow them if local officials chose to approve them. It would restore true freedom of religion as the First Amendment intended.It would also protect freedom of conscience for Christians who object to participating in abortions, or dispensing abortifacient medicines, or who do not wish to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies. It is also possible that a conservative Supreme Court would eventually return control of marriage to the states.Freedom for Christian influence in politicsSignificantly, Trump has pledged to work to repeal the 1954 Johnson Amendment to the IRS code, which has been used for 62 years as a threat to silence pastors from speaking about political issues, for fear of losing their tax-exempt status. This would be a great victory for freedom of religion and freedom of speech.In short, a Trump-appointed Supreme Court, together with dozens of lower court judges appointed by him, would probably result in significant advances in many of the policy areas important to Christians. It would also open the door to huge expansion of influence for the many Christian lobbying groups known as  family policy councils  in various states, especially enabling them to work for further legal protections for life, for marriage and family, and for religious liberty.How can we know that Trump won t change his mind? But Trump has changed his mind in the past,  a politically-minded friend said to me.  How do you know that he will do what he has promised? Maybe he ll betray you and appoint a liberal Supreme Court justice. My reply is that we can never know the future conduct of any human being with 100% certainty, but in making an ethical decision like this one, we should base the decision on the most likely results. In this case, the most likely result is that Trump will do most or all of what he has said.In the history of American politics, candidates who have been elected president have occasionally changed their minds on one or another issue while in office, but no president has ever gone back on most of what he has promised to do, especially on issues that are crucially important in the election. In this election, it is reasonable to think that the most likely result is that both Trump and Clinton will do what they have promised to do. That is the basis on which we should decide how to vote.And notice how Trump has changed his mind. He continues to move in a more conservative direction, as evidenced by his list of judges and his choice for vice president. Just as he succeeded in business by listening to the best experts to solve each problem, I suspect that he has been learning from the best experts in conservative political thought and has increasingly found that conservative solutions really work. We should applaud these changes.His choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate is an especially significant indication that he will govern as a conservative. Trump could have picked a moderate but instead picked a lifelong solid conservative who is a thoughtful, gracious policy wizard. Pence is a lawyer and former talk radio host who served 12 years in Congress and had significant congressional leadership positions, so he will be immensely helpful in working with Congress. He is a committed evangelical Christian. He is a former board member of the Indiana Family Institute, a conservative Christian lobbying group in Indiana.However, the Supreme Court is not the only issue at stake in this election. While I disagree with Trump on a few things (especially trade policy), on most important issues, Trump will likely do much good for the nation.Taxes and jobsTrump has pledged to cut taxes significantly, while Clinton wants to raise them. Trump is advocating a 15% tax rate for corporations rather than the current 35%. Lower corporate taxes would lead to business expansion and a massive increase in available jobs and higher pay levels. For individual taxpayers, Trump favors a top rate of 25%, but for Clinton it s 45%. Most small businesses file under this individual rate, so once again Trump s lower taxes would result in substantial expansion of businesses and many more jobs. Finally our economy would snap out of its eight years of anemic growth.In my judgment, Christians should support lower tax rates that would lead to more jobs, because Obama s economic policies for the last eight years have hurt lower income and low-middle income families the most. Many can t even find jobs, and others can t find full-time jobs. Those who have jobs struggle to survive with no meaningful pay raises year after year. It is no surprise that these are the people who are supporting Trump in overwhelming numbers.Tax rates are also a good indicator of government control. Higher tax rates mean greater government control of our lives, while lower tax rates indicate greater freedom.MinoritiesTwo of the deepest causes of poverty among minority groups and racial tensions in our country are failing public schools in our inner cities and lack of available jobs. Trump expressed a commitment to solve these problems at several points in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention. He pledged to reduce taxes and regulations, leading to many more jobs. And he said: Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are not employed . . . . This administration has failed America s inner cities. It s failed them on education. It s failed and on jobs. It s failed them on crime . . . . Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? . . . . We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice. By contrast, Clinton will bow to the teachers  unions and oppose school choice at every turn, and she will continue to strangle businesses with high taxes and regulations, preventing job growth.The militaryTrump has promised to rapidly rebuild our depleted military forces, but Clinton would continue the liberal policy of eviscerating them through denying funding. This is dangerous in light of increasing threats from China, Russia, Iran, and ISIS.BordersTrump has repeatedly promised that he will finally secure our borders, an urgent need to protect the nation from ever more terrorists and drug smugglers. Clinton will not do this but will continue to allow in what she thinks will be thousands of future Democratic voters.ISIS and terrorismTrump has pledged to aggressively attack and utterly defeat ISIS. Clinton will continue the anemic Obama policy of periodic bombing runs and drone attacks, under which ISIS has continued to thrive.China and RussiaTrump will not let China and Russia and Iran push us around anymore, as Obama has done, with Hillary Clinton s support when she was secretary of state. If Trump is anything, he is tough as nails, and he won t be bullied.IsraelTrump has promised to vigorously defend and support Israel, while Clinton will most likely continue the Obama administration s criticism, snubbing, and marginalization of Israel.EnergyTrump has said he will approve the Keystone oil pipeline and grant more oil drilling permits leading to lower energy costs and providing thousands of jobs. Lower energy costs help everybody, but the poor most of all. Clinton, by contrast, will make fracking nearly impossible and essentially abolish the coal industry, causing energy prices to skyrocket.Executive orders and bathroomsTrump has promised to rescind many of the most objectionable executive orders given by President Obama, so he will likely end the compulsory moral degradation forced on us by a liberal agenda, including orders forcing schools to allow boys in girls  bathrooms and locker rooms, in defiance of the will of the vast majority of Americans. But Hillary Clinton would likely perpetuate and expand these policies.Health careTrump will work to repeal Obamacare, which is ruining the nation s health care system, and replace it with an affordable free market system in which companies have the ability to sell insurance across state lines, thus substantially lowering insurance prices especially in those states that currently allow only high-priced  Cadillac  insurance plans. But Clinton would continue to work relentlessly toward federal government control of our entire health care industry.The unprotectedTrump will finally begin to recognize and protect what Wall Street Journal writer Peggy Noonan calls  the unprotected  in America   people in lower income areas who cannot find good jobs, cannot find good schools for their children, do not feel protected from crime, and find their retirement savings are not enough because for years they have been earning no interest in the bank. Trump said in his acceptance speech,  Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across the nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned . . . I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. These American citizens recognize that Trump has built a business career on listening to experts, solving problems, and getting things done. They realize that Trump didn t earn $4 billion by being stupid, and their instinct says that he might be exactly the right person to solve some of the biggest problems in a nation that has for too long been headed in the wrong direction and stuck in political gridlock.They may not have college degrees but their old-fashioned common sense tells them that America would be a much better place if we no longer had to be afraid to say  Merry Christmas,  or that boys are different from girls, or that Islamic terrorists are Islamic terrorists. They re sick and tired of being condescended to by the snobbish moralism of the liberal elites who dominate the power centers in our nation. That is why they cheer when Trump repeatedly violates the canons of politically correct speech. They have found in him someone who gives them hope, and they are supporting him by the thousands.Does character matter? But are you saying that character doesn t matter?  someone might ask. I believe that character does matter, but I think Trump s character is far better than what is portrayed by much current political mud-slinging, and far better than his opponent s character.In addition, if someone makes doubts about character the only factor to consider, that is a fallacy in ethical reasoning that I call  reductionism    the mistake of reducing every argument to only one factor, when the situation requires that multiple factors be considered. In this election, an even larger factor is the future of the nation that would flow from a Clinton or a Trump presidency.To my friends who tell me they won t vote for Trump because there is a chance he won t govern at all like he promises, I reply that all of American presidential history shows that that result is unlikely, and it is ethically fallacious reasoning to base a decision on assuming a result that is unlikely to happen.Consider instead the most likely results. The most likely result of voting for Trump is that he will govern the way he promises to do, bringing much good to the nation.But the most likely result of not voting for Trump is that you will be abandoning thousands of unborn babies who will be put to death under Hillary Clinton s Supreme Court, thousands of Christians who will be excluded from their lifelong occupations, thousands of the poor who will never again be able to find high-paying jobs in an economy crushed by government hostility toward business, thousands of inner-city children who will never be able to get a good education, thousands of the sick and elderly who will never get adequate medical treatment when the government is the nation s only healthcare provider, thousands of people who will be killed by an unchecked ISIS, and millions of Jews in Israel who will find themselves alone and surrounded by hostile enemies. And you will be contributing to a permanent loss of the American system of government due to a final victory of unaccountable judicial tyranny.When I look at it this way, my conscience, and my considered moral judgment tell me that I must vote for Donald Trump as the candidate who is most likely to do the most good for the United States of America.Wayne Grudem Biography Wayne Grudem Wayne Grudem is Research Professor of Theology and Biblical Studies at Phoenix Seminary in Arizona.

Former Bears coach Mike Ditka is coming under fire from the liberal media and Black Lives Matter activists for saying there has been  no oppression in the last 100 years .Former Chicago Bears star and coach Mike Ditka, an adamant critic of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial discrimination, said Monday in a national radio interview that this country has been free of oppression for at least a century. All of a sudden, it s become a big deal now, about oppression,  Ditka told Jim Gray on Westwood One s pregame show ahead of the Bears   Monday Night Football  loss to the Vikings.  There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of. Now maybe I m not watching it as carefully as other people. As a side note, the now unemployed and clearly  oppressed  49 ers QB, Colin Kaepernick who started kneeling to show his unity with the anti-cop, Black Lives Matter movement, listed his humble abode in San Jose, CA, 10 months ago, for a mere $2.9 million.According to Realtor.com, the gated four-bedroom, 5.5-bath estate features 4,500 square feet of living space on a 20,000-square-foot secluded lot with a long private driveway and expansive views of the valley.Ditka continued: Is that the stage for this? If you want to protest, or whatever you want to protest, you ve got a right to do that, but I think you re a professional athlete, you have an obligation to the game,  Ditka said.  I think you have to respect the game. That s what I think is the most important thing. I don t see a lot of respect for the game. I just see respect for their own individual opinions. Opinions are like noses, we all have one. Some are good. Some are bad. Ditka insisted he wasn t  condemning anybody or criticizing anybody  but urged players to  protest when the game s over, protest whatever other way you want to  and said he would bench players who insisted on demonstrating during the anthem because it s disrespectful. If you don t respect our country, then you shouldn t be in this country playing football,  he said.  Go to another country and play football. If you had to go somewhere else to try to play the sport, you wouldn t have a job. So that would be my take. If you can t respect the flag and the country, then you don t respect what this is all about. So I would say, adios. Gray cited athletes such as Muhammad Ali and Jesse Owens who have taken on social injustices, but Ditka was unmoved. I don t know what social injustices have been,  Ditka said.  Muhammad Ali rose to the top. Jesse Owens is one of the classiest individuals that ever lived. I mean, you can say,  Are you (saying) everything is based on color?  I don t see it that way. I think that you have to be color blind in this country. You ve got to look at a person for what he is and what he stands for and how he produces, not by the color of his skin. That has never had anything to do with anything. Ditka said there are opportunities for everyone in the United States, regardless of race, religion, creed, color, nationality  if you want to work, if you want to try, if you want to put effort into yourself. I think you can accomplish anything, and we have watched that throughout our history of our country. People rise to the top and they became very influential people in our country by doing the right things.   Trib LiveMost of America gets what Ditka is trying to say when he says there has been  no oppression for 100 years . He s clearly referring to the era of slavery. The idea, however, that Ditka would point out that slavery ended 100 years ago, and that we are, and have been, for decades, a nation of equal opportunity for all, was more than the left and the liberal media could bear.

Washington claims it was an act of  collective self-defense  because the Syrian jet had dropped bombs  near US-backed forces.  Syrian officials in Damascus deny the US claims, stating that their plane was downed while conducting a strike on an ISIS position. According to a statement released by Damascus, the US act of aggression in Syria airspace was a flagrant attack was an attempt to undermine the efforts of the army as the only effective force capable with its allies  in fighting terrorism across its territory.  Officials added that,  this comes at a time when the Syrian army and its allies were making clear advances in fighting the (ISIS) terrorist group. US officials are claiming that pro-Syrian regime forces  on the ground attacked the US-backed Kurdish militias under the  SDF  brand (Syrian Democratic Forces) near Tabqa outside Raqqa, after which time the US-led Coalition planes engaged Syrian military. US officials then claim that a Syrian planes dropped bombs near the US-backed forces. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov issue this statement:  We call on the United State and all others who have their forces or advisors on the ground [in Syria] to ensure the coordination in our work. Zones of de-escalation are one of the possible options to jointly move forward. We call on everyone to avoid unilateral moves, respect Syrian sovereignty and join our common work which is agreed with the Syrian Arab Republic s government. 21WIRE reported earlier this week how the presence of US and UK troops on the ground inside of Syrian sovereign territory may be provoking an escalation of an already tense situation in both Raqqa and in the region around al-Tanf. US-led coalition forces are supposedly there to train and assist anti-ISIS  militias, but also anti-Assad  rebel militias too. The US also also trying to impose self-styled  deconfliction zones around al-Tanf.In recent months, the Syrian Army have been making huge advances against ISIS positions. This latest US attack on Syria indicates that the US do not want the Syrian Army involved in the liberation of Raqqa   presumable to be able to stage-manage and control the operation and media coverage for its global audience, as the US did previously with Mosul in Iraq.A clear pattern has emerged with almost every US strike against Syrian forces inside of Syria   in each and every instance, the main beneficiary appears to be ISIS.Based on past incidents where US forces have attack Syrian military assets, in each instance the US attacks have benefited ISIS on the ground   leading many to conclude that the US Coalition forces are helping ISIS to gain strategic advantage against the Syria Army on the ground.Back in September 2016, US had attacked and massacred over 80 Syrian military soldiers after a  Coalition  airstrike on Dier Azor   a US attack which allowed ISIS to strategically advance past Syrian Army defensive positions. In addition to aiding ISIS on the ground, this act by the US also ruined any chance of a viable ceasefire agreement with Russia and Syria at the time.A similar events took place on June 5, 2017 when US-led coalition forces attacked what they called  pro-Syrian regime forces  near the town of al Tanf in southeast Syria, claiming the Syrian forces including some 60 troops, had somehow entered what the US claim was a  well-established de-confliction zone.  The US strike helped to take pressure off of a retreating ISIS in the region.In addition to this, the US cruise missile strike Syria s Sharat airbase near Homs killed some 80 people, supposedly in response to an alleged ;chemical weapons attack at Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib Province.According to Aleppo MP Fares Shehabi, the US missile attack should be viewed as  an act against an airport that is solely dedicated to fighting ISIS in Syria. And this attack is illegal, it s stupid. As it stands the US presence in Syria is in violation of both US and International Law.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: 2016 elections by BAR editor and columnist, Dr. Marsha Adebayo \nThe “revolving, rigged system” that purports to be American democracy was revealed in all its corporate vulgarity on a Baltimore university stage, last week. Two U.S. Senate candidates of the duopoly parties pretended to support the Green Party’s candidate’s right to join the debate, but failed to protest when cops hauled her away. “This was their ‘Rosa Parks’ moment when they could have stood for integrity and democracy” -- but failed the test. Green Party’s Margaret Flowers Challenges US Senate Debate in Maryland as Undemocratic by BAR editor and columnist, Dr. Marsha Adebayo \n“ The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard.” \nUS corruption during this campaign season is on full display for the entire world to ponder. No one paying even scant attention can deny the thin veneer that is used to hide state sponsored police murder of Africans, structural poverty and the cozy relationship between the 1% rulers in the Democratic and Republican parties. Green Party candidates, such as Jill Stein, Ajamu Baraka and Margaret Flowers have forced sunlight’s disinfectant power to expose a rigged, racist and revolting political system that politically and economically devours communities of color, condones police murders of Black youth, intentionally exposes communities, like Flint, Michigan, to poisoned water, promotes drone warfare and the pilfering of the natural resources of Africa and South America. \nThe system, however is finding it more difficult to block out the voices of dissent. Such was the situation this week at the University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs where Dr. Margaret Flowers, the Green Party candidate for the Maryland US Senate seat, was refused the opportunity to participate in the only televised debate alongside Democratic Congressman Chris Van Hollen and Republican state Del. Kathy Szeliga. The corporate media and the political duopoly collaborated to ensure that the Green Party message would not be heard. The sham excuse used to exclude Flowers was that her poll numbers had not reached 15%. But, of course it is difficult to reach the magic number of 15% in the polls when one is systematically excluded from debates and public events. This is the revolving rigged system that Black people know so well. \n“When the police came to escort her off the stage neither candidate provided a meaningful protest of the anti-democratic process unfolding.” \nWhen the rigged debate started, audience members called for Dr. Flowers to join Van Hollen and Szeliga. Shouts of “let her speak” could be heard from the audience. Responding to the audience, Dr. Flowers took her place on the stage shaking hands with both candidates.

The constant barrage of infotainment from the indispensable nation, the exceptional nation and the benign super power tells us of a distinct desire to consume information reality-free. \nThis informational GMO has permeated every facet of our existence and has infected the minds of billions around the world. It can be ridiculed, seen as inferior or even unsustainable. But do understand that it is the food for the liberal soul and it is a formidable force to be reckoned with. \nHuman beings drive the vast bulk of their understanding of the world through information either delivered directly via consumable media or indirectly via peer impressions, religion, anecdotes, fables and cultural norms. All of it ultimately centres on the flow of information which is a commodity that has been designed, refined, repackaged and is continually ‘improved’. Most of us underestimate the true awesome power of mass media, we read the statistics, the concentration of power and observe the echo chamber yet we still need to let it all sink in to truly grasp what it means. \nMass media is the encapsulation of the spectrum of information; From magazine to sports to history to business to politics, it is driven by a seamless thread of a philosophy guiding the ego & soul towards an atomised individualistic view of the world. It is an echo chamber that has not seen its parallel before on this planet, an organ to shape reality for the billions. A human being is a hodge-podge of history, culture, religion, philosophy, geography, epigenetics and a host of many more layers of information. Mass Media is the flute that organises this cacophony into a melody, and just like that a marionette of the modern man is born. \nResistance to the pied piper is possible but requires one to leave that womb of comfort that the information matrix provides with its legions of followers; That feeling of belonging, of being understood, of being ‘right’ and of being good. The strength can only come from reality but in our upside down world many are malnourished on the diet of GM information and it is not a problem for only Americans – who are severely affected – but instead it is a global phenomenon. \nSuccessful entrepreneurs, businessmen, academics, financial experts, journalists, neighbours, friends, brothers, sisters and parents can all be entangled in the web of the information matrix. Many of us have been at pains to explain the conflicts in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Ukraine and Yemen to our colleagues and friends but it is as if the words fall on deaf ears. The cognitive dissonance is heavy and the Teflon like value-matrix – a product of pre-packaged popularly accepted globalised values- lets all facts, figures and evidence that we present slip off. It is about the first woman president elect and not her war crimes, it is about the opposing camp saying that a racist, misogynist bigot is worse than a psychopathic mass murderer. It is inverted reality. It is full on dystopia. \nWhere do you begin to explain that elections are for the most part mere stage managed theatre? That the USA is an Empire of 1,000 military bases and not a country? That Obama the peace maker has incinerated civilians in 7 countries with impunity? That Hillary’s black lives did not matter for whole black Libyan towns that were extinguished? That President Asad’s Syria is LGBTQ friendly and the “Syrian revolution” that never was is the opposite? Or that it simply is not about personality politics, gay rights and black lives but is about a class struggle? \nMoreover, how do you abstract further and talk about Imperialism with a populace that thinks that protesting with Soros funds -to the benefit of the imperial war machine- is inline with being a Communist/Marxist movement? How do you explain Imperialism when King Leopold II has his bust on display with a higher tally than that of Hitler? \nA chasm in time it is and it is widening. \nI have been speaking to friends of the past 20 years trying to give my view of what I feel is missing in the discourse; Class struggle, how mass media works, what colour revolutions are, what imperialism is and how we ought to abandon personality politics. Our biggest obstacle is personality politics, and we are seen through that lens as arrogant bastards trying to educate Ivy League graduates, hedge fund managers, educated graduates and Silicon Valley success stories. How can we, the deplorable, know anything anyway? \nAfter a recent exchange, a Rhodes Scholar quipped: “To put it succinctly, you are saying Trump is good for Russia. I think we kind of get that”. I did not know what to say, the Teflon value matrix had won again. Plato’s democratic man guards the citadel of his soul with vengeance. \nAnother highly educated and decorated researcher at a prestigious Ivy League university said “… under Obama our economy bounced back, unemployment went down, we didn’t start any major new wars” and ended his raving review by stating “Obama did a great job.” The painful part is coming to terms with a colonized mind; These educated men and women are the crème de la crème of their imperialism ravaged countries, the ones who proverbially “made it”. \nTheir world makes sense to them, the Mass Media might have shamed itself in our eyes and the veil might have been lifted for us. But for them their convictions have only strengthened and they have been wronged by the basket of deplorables. \nMohsin Siddiqui", "output": "0. Fake"}

On October 13, 2009, Anaya emailed Abedin seeking to arrange a meeting between Fanjul, the CEO of Florida Crystals, and Clinton. Jiloty responded the next day, asking that Anaya talk with Clinton scheduler Lona Valmoro about “setting up a meeting.” Fanjul donated more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation and was a Bill Clinton co-chairman in Florida. \nIn an October 26, 2009, email exchange, power attorney and Hillary Clinton financial supporter, Charlie Ann Syprett, contacted Doug Band, apparently seeking help in getting around U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) restrictions on U.S. citizens’ ability to travel to Cuba. Syprett ostensibly wanted a waiver from the restrictions to enable people from her organization, SYC Charitable Foundation, to travel to Cuba, noting “we are not asking for something out of the ordinary.” \nThe emails also show that Valmoro sent Clinton’s government schedule to the unsecure email addresses of numerous members of the Clinton Foundation staff on October 16, 2009, again on October 18, 2009, and on October 25, 2009.

They attempted to seek a place to stay but were denied by one shelter. So they sought refuge in the home of a former member of their church.Perkins is also still trying to figure out why God would smite his home. We re gonna look for what God s gonna do in this,  Perkins said.  I m asking those questions and I m going to see. Here s the audio via Raw Story.Usually, it s customary to feel sympathy for people who suffer losses due to flooding, but this is a special kind of irony that needs special commentary.As we all know, conservative  Christians  are constantly telling us that whenever there is an earthquake or a hurricane or a flood that it s punishment by God over homosexuality or abortion or some other social issue that has them all in a tizzy, especially when that natural disaster doesn t affect them personally.Now, the idea that God is sending natural disasters to punish people is complete bullshit, but let s just pretend for a moment that that is the case. The Perkins household just got severely damaged by a  flood of biblical proportions  as stated by Perkins himself, and they were driven out of their home.So by conservative logic, that must mean that he is being punished for something. And since Perkins is an anti-gay bigot who wants to suppress women s rights, one could easily surmise that God is sending Perkins a message to stop being a dick toward other human beings. You know, actually love your neighbor and treat others the way you want to be treated.But Perkins will likely fail to see that message. He ll just twist it to his own advantage. Because when it comes right down to it, conservative  Christians  think natural disasters are only sent to punish others, but when they are affected personally they believe it s only sent by God to test their faith. In other words, complete and total hypocrisy.The moral of the story, however, should be that conservatives should stop claiming that disasters are punishments by God, because there is a such thing as karma and Tony Perkins is learning that the hard way.Featured image via Wikimedia", "output": "0.

His horrible responses to the Neo-nazi/KKK/White Supremacist hate rally in Charlottesville, Virginia proves that he s only concerned with a tiny portion of the United States, and that s his frightening and adoring base.While Trump s approval ratings continue to fall among most Americans, his base is lapping up Trump s attempts at spurring on racial division.A GOP strategist working campaigns in red and purple states said that while support for Trump generally declined slightly since Charlottesville, support rose among his base, after a decline last month because of the failure on health care and revelations about the Russia investigation. This strategist said many Trump supporters applaud the president s continuing desire to shake up Washington, favor his economic priorities and admire his willingness to speak his mind.Source: Washington PostPolitically, this is stupid.But he said Trump has nonetheless created a longer-term risk.  What he s doing that s harmful is he s removing people from the persuadable audience, and that s dangerous,  he said.

Some people on the left lock horns over Clinton often enough to suggest that Team Hillary still has a long way to go before she has shored up the traditional base of progressive voters.A controversial book cover is the latest flashpoint to lay bare the divisions in the Democratic base over the Clinton candidacy. The forthcoming book,  My Turn,  by Nation Magazine Contributing Editor Doug Henwood, critiques the former secretary of state s decades-long political career, calling out her foreign policy positions and purported connections to big-money interests, among other contentious points.And the book cover s flamboyant illustration   featuring a stoic Hillary Clinton, in a blood-red dress, pointing a gun at the reader   has sparked a heated debate among her supporters and detractors.Salon editor Joan Walsh and former Obama speechwriter Jon Lovett both called the drawing  gross. The leftist rag Salon.com has this to say about the new Hillary Clinton book: A stink bomb into liberals  certainty : Doug Henwood on his anti-Clinton crusade.Here is a portion of Salon.com s review of Henwood s  My Turn  book:In this regard, Harper s latest (paywalled) cover story   a cri de coeur against Hillary Clinton from economist, radio host, author and Left Business Observer founder Doug Henwood   is no exception. A mix of biography and political analysis, Henwood s essay depicts the likely 2016 presidential candidate as a relatively unaccomplished conformist and careerist, one who s far more interested in acquiring power (and protecting the interests of her wealthy funders) than making real the progressive vision.  What is the case for Hillary?  Henwood asks.  It s hard to find any substantive political argument in her favor. Even the author and the artist have different takes on the imagery. People often see in texts what they want to see. The reaction to this cover, which has been circulating less than 48 hours, has been a vivid reminder of this,  Henwood told MSNBC.  When I first saw the design I knew it would attract a lot of attention.   But I couldn t have predicted the diversity of reactions. Where Henwood sees  ruthlessness and hawkishness,  in the image, the artist, Sarah Sole told the International Business Times she sees it as  pulpy and sexy. Henwood is a well-known Clinton critic on the left who skewered the former secretary of state, senator and first lady in a controversial 2014 Harper s Magazine cover story titled  Stop Hillary.  In it he wrote:What is the case for Hillary (whose quasi-official website identifies her, in bold blue letters, by her first name only, as do millions upon millions of voters)? It boils down to this: She has experience, she s a woman, and it s her turn. It s hard to find any substantive political argument in her favor. She has, in the past, been associated with women s issues, with children s issues   but she also encouraged her husband to sign the 1996 bill that put an end to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC), which had been in effect since 1935. Indeed, longtime Clinton adviser Dick Morris, who has now morphed into a right-wing pundit, credits Hillary for backing both of Bill s most important moves to the center: the balanced budget and welfare reform.1 And during her subsequent career as New York s junior senator and as secretary of state, she has scarcely budged from the centrist sweet spot, and has become increasingly hawkish on foreign policy.What Hillary will deliver, then, is more of the same. And that shouldn t surprise us. As wacky as it sometimes appears on the surface, American politics has an amazing stability and continuity about it. Obama, widely viewed as a populist action hero during the 2008 campaign, made no bones about his admiration for Ronald Reagan. The Gipper, he said,changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. I think they felt [that] with all the excesses of the Sixties and the Seventies, government had grown and grown, but there wasn t much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating.Now, the  excesses of the Sixties and the Seventies  included things like feminism, gay liberation, the antiwar movement, a militant civil rights movement   all good things, in my view, but I know that many people disagree. In any case, coming into office with something like a mandate, Obama never tried to make a sharp political break with the past, as Reagan did from the moment of his first inaugural address. Reagan dismissed the postwar Keynesian consensus   the idea that government had a responsibility to soften the sharpest edges of capitalism by fighting recession and providing some sort of basic safety net. Appropriating some of the language of the left about revolution and the promise of the future, he unleashed what he liked to call the magic of the marketplace: cutting taxes for the rich, eliminating regulations, and whittling away at social spending.What Reagan created, with his embrace of the nutty Laffer curve and his smiling war on organized labor, was a strange, unequally distributed boom that lasted through the early 1990s. After the caretaker George H. W. Bush administration evaporated, Bill Clinton took over and, with a few minor adjustments, kept the party going for another decade. Profits skyrocketed, as did the financial markets.But there was a contradiction under it all: a system dependent on high levels of mass consumption for both economic dynamism and political legitimacy has a problem when mass purchasing power is squeezed. For a few decades, consumers borrowed to make up for what their paychecks were lacking. But that model broke down once and for all with the crisis of 2008. Today we desperately need a new political economy   one that features a more equal distribution of income, investment in our rotting social and physical infrastructure, and a more humane ethic. We also need a judicious foreign policy, and a commander-in-chief who will resist the instant gratification of air strikes and rhetorical bluster.Is Hillary Clinton the answer to these prayers? It s hard to think so, despite the widespread liberal fantasy of her as a progressive paragon, who will follow through exactly as Barack Obama did not. In fact, a close look at her life and career is perhaps the best antidote to all these great expectations.But the intimidating image glaring out from the front of  My Turn  was created long before Henwood penned the book, which he says was developed out of the Harper s piece and goes into greater detail about  her long history in shaping the  New Democrat agenda,      an agenda which  she now purports to be running against,  Henwood told MSNBC.And then there s Sole, a diehard Clinton supporter and also a fan of Henwood s, according to International Business Times.Sole debuted the painting, along with other similarly themed pieces, last year. Later, the pieces were published in Politico magazine under the headline  Extremely Ready for Hillary,  according to the International Business Times. I love Hillary Clinton, I support Hillary Clinton, I very much want her to be president. I will certainly vote for her,  Sole told International Business Times. What I don t get is the reaction that calls the cover sexist,  Henwood told MSNBC.  Hillary is tough and determined, characteristics that shouldn t be seen as off-limits to women. The political question is what she or anyone else does with toughness and determination, and that s what my criticism of her focuses on. I have no problem with ball-busting women,  Henwood continued.  I kinda like them, in fact. I just don t like [Hillary Clinton s] politics.  Via: MSNBC", "output": "0. Fake"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: It seems that every time we turn around, there s a new layer to the con that is Donald Trump. While we re in the thick of the presidential election, Trump is being accused of conning people with his Trump University. He s conning people with email fundraising scams. He s even conning people with his fake knowledge of the Constitution and his fake Christianity.If you re still not sure about that last one (after all, he is the favorite for Evangelicals), it s been uncovered that his  spiritual advisor  is herself a con artist who scams people out of $1,144 each in a Harry Potter inspired scam.Trump credits Pastor Paula White with his conversion to Christianity. The two have a lot in common. White is an attractive blonde (likely just his type) and at 50, she, like Trump, has been married three times. She s known Trump for a long time and has claimed that his conversion came long before Trump began his run for office. I can absolutely tell you that Mr. Trump has a relationship with God. He is a Christian, he accepts Jesus as his Lord and savior,  White said in a rare interview with POLITICO, reflecting on a relationship with the New York tycoon that has now spanned more than 14 years.She won t elaborate, though, on the exact moment Trump decided to accept Jesus as his Lord and savior. One thing that might attract him to her brand of Christianity is her belief that God wants people to be wealthy. She happily flaunts her wealth, even if much of it is ill gotten. She s in trouble with the IRS, she has business troubles and she s common tabloid fodder.White, an author and TV personality who at one time had  millions in the bank,  has had financial challenges of her own. In the early 2000s, the ministry s spending habits drew scrutiny first from the IRS, and then from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who launched a congressional probe. The probe was eventually dropped (her ministry didn t fully respond to congressional inquiries, according to reports at the time). The Tampa-based church that she and her ex-husband founded and led   which began to fall apart after their 2007 divorce   declared bankruptcy in 2014, though by then she was leading another church, in Orlando.One specific scam, though, came straight from the Harry Potter novels. For the low, low price of $1,144, White will sell her rubes a  resurrection seed,  much like Harry Potter s  resurrection stone.  The resurrection seed promises to resurrect the dead. The $1,144 figure came from John 11:44, which says,  I believe for resurrection life. Preaching the story of Lazarus who Jesus resurrected from the dead in John 11:38-44, White promised believers in a video appeal that if they would sow the seed and have faith, she believed deliverance would come. I don t know what is dead. I don t know what the enemy sent a death to. I don t know what decision that caused death to come upon whatever the situation you re facing, but I do know that God has sent me to you to bring resurrection life. To tell you that I believe that as we put our faith together before Easter Sunday on March 27, there s gonna be resurrection life in your life,  said White. The grave clothes are coming off,  she continued.  Whatever residue of death. Whatever residue is holding you back, it is coming off.

Birds of a feather.Featured image via Pastor Paula White s website and John Sommers II at Getty Images.", "output": "0. Fake"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: in: Politics , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests (image credit: AP/Alex Brandon) Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote. Most Americans don’t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney’s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state. Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a quote from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times … “I don’t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,” said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens. Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney . “I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney’s name,” Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House. She said that the first time she pushed “Romney,” the machine marked “Obama.” So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time. “Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,” she told Fox News. And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago. For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012. If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren’t even worth mentioning. And of course this didn’t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country . The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again. In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper … Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes “switched.” The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday. And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas … Gary and I went to early vote today…I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn’t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don’t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed. I don’t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that. A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas … Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone’s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit! And of course they weren’t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon … So is there a serious problem with the voting machines? According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots… Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters . Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a “software update” on ES&S machines that otherwise “omit one race” when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch. Let’s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump’s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done. But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else. Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are “no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate“… In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country: Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote Close to 3 million registered in multiples states Approximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled “ Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead “… Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. Americans overall are more confident that the nation’s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner. Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media. And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up … U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia’s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. Now that is a real “conspiracy theory”, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn’t so serious. During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it. The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us. And let’s watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong. Submit your review", "output": "0. Fake"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Posted on October 26, 2016 by DavidSwanson \nOfficially, of course, the national bird of the United States is that half-a-peace-sign that Philadelphia sports fans like to hold up at opposing teams. But unofficially, the film National Bird has it right: the national bird is a killer drone. \nFinally, finally, finally, somebody allowed me to see this movie. And finally somebody made this movie. There have been several drone movies worth seeing , most of them fictional drama , and one very much worth avoiding ( Eye in the Sky ). But National Bird is raw truth, not entirely unlike what you might fantasize media news reports would be in a magical world in which media outlets gave a damn about human life. \nThe first half of National Bird is the stories of three participants in the U.S. military’s drone murder program, as told by them. And then, just as you’re starting to think you’ll have to write that old familiar review that praises how well the stories of the victims among the aggressors were told but asks in exasperation whether any of the victims of the actual missiles have any stories, National Bird expands to include just what is so often missing, and even to combine the two narratives in a powerful way. \nHeather Linebaugh wanted to protect people, benefit the world, travel, see the world, and use super cool technology. Apparently our society did not explain to her in time what it means to join the military. Now she suffers guilt, anxiety, moral injury, PTSD, sleep disorder, despair, and a sense of responsibility to speak out on behalf of friends, other veterans, who have killed themselves or become too alcoholic to speak for themselves. Linebaugh helped murder people with missiles from drones, and watched them die, and identified body parts or watched loved ones gather up body parts. \nEven while still in the Air Force, Linebaugh was on a suicide watch list and had a psychologist recommend moving her to a different sort of job, but the Air Force refused. She has episodes. She sees things. She hears things. But she’s forbidden to discuss her work with friends or even with a therapist who doesn’t have the proper “security clearance.” \nWe let Daniel down even more than Heather. He says he actually opposed militarism but was homeless and desperate, so he joined the military. We could have given him a house for much less than we paid him to help murder people at Fort Meade. \nLisa Ling worked on a database filled by drone surveillance that compiled information on 121,000 “targets” in two years. Multiply that by a dozen years. With 90% of victims not among the targets, add up how many people would die in the targeting of the whole list. That’d be over 7 million. But it’s not numbers that have poisoned the souls of these three veterans; it’s children and mothers and brothers and uncles lying in pieces on the ground. \nLing travels to Afghanistan to see the place at ground level and to meet with drone victims. She meets a little boy who lost his leg and his 4-year-old brother and his sister and his father. On February 2, 2010, drone “pilots” at Creech Air Base murdered 23 innocent members of one family. \nThe filmmakers have voices read the written transcript of what the drone operators said to each other before, during, and after sending in the missiles that did the damage. This is worse than Collateral Murder . The people whose job it is to identify children and others who should not be murdered have identified children among the group of people being targeted. The “pilots” at Creech are eager to reject this information and to get onto killing as many people as they can. Their lust for blood drives the decision process. Only after they’ve killed 23 people do they recognize children among the survivors, and the lack of guns. \nWe see the bodies brought home to bury. Those injured describe their suffering, physical as well as mental. We see people being fitted with artificial legs. We hear Afghans describe their perception of drones. They imagine, just as many Americans may imagine, and just as viewers of Eye in the Sky would imagine, that drone operators have a clear, high resolution view of everything. In fact, they have a view of fuzzy little blobs on a computer screen that looks like it was created in the 1980s. \nLinebaugh says there is no way to distinguish the little “civilian” blobs from little “militant” blobs. When Daniel hears President Obama claim that there is always near certainty that no civilians will be killed, Daniel explains that such knowledge is simply not possible. Linebaugh says she was often on the side of the conversation telling the “pilots” at Creech not to murder innocents, but that they always pushed for permission to kill. \nJesselyn Radack, attorney for whistleblowers, says in the film that the FBI told two whistleblowers that a terrorist group had put them on a kill list. She said that the FBI has also contacted Linebaugh’s family and warned her that “terrorists” have been searching for her name online, suggesting that she fix this problem by shutting up. (She had written an op-ed in the Guardian ). \nThe FBI also raids Daniel’s house, arriving with 30 to 50 agents, badges, guns, cameras, and search warrants. They take away his papers, electronics, and phone. They tell him he is under investigation for a possible indictment under the Espionage Act. This is the World War I-era law for targeting foreign enemies that President Obama has made a routine of using to target domestic whistleblowers. While Obama has prosecuted more people under this law than did all previous presidents combined, we probably have no way of knowing how many people have been explicitly threatened with the possibility. \nWhile we should be apologizing to, comforting, and aiding these young people rather than denying them the right to speak to anybody and threatening them with decades in prison, Lisa Ling did manage to find some kindness. Victims of drone strikes in Afghanistan told her that they forgave her. As the film ends, she’s planning another trip to Afghanistan. This entry was posted in General . Bookmark the permalink .

Warren Campbell inside his army surplus store Redoubt Surplus and Tactical near Coeur d’Alene, Idaho (Erin Collins/CBC) \nA redoubt is a little-used military term that refers to a temporary fortification. The American Redoubt is both a movement and an unofficial geographic zone that includes Idaho, Wyoming, Montana and the eastern parts of Washington and Oregon. \nThe term was coined in 2011 by survivalist James Wesley Rawles, who identified the region as the best place to wait out a disaster in the U.S., be it natural, economic or political. \nRawles sees the Redoubt as a place where mostly conservative, Christian Americans who are worried about the future should move and prepare for the worst. The goal is to create a safe haven where like-minded Americans, many of whom refer to themselves as “preppers,” can live off the land, be more self-sufficient and wait out the calamities to come. ‘The holy cause of liberty’ \nPast the tactical gear and through a hallway at the back of Redoubt Surplus and Tactical , you’ll find Pastor Warren Campbell’s other venture, The Lordship Church . \nAdorned in military garb and sporting an Abe Lincoln-style beard, Campbell sets out folding metal chairs to get ready for his weekend service, where about three dozen people usually come to hear him preach. \n“We love to preach on liberty, the holy cause of liberty — George Washington called liberty a sacred fire and our liberties are very, very dear to us, especially the liberties we have in Jesus Christ.” Pastor Warren Campbell inside his makeshift church connected to his army surplus store in northern Idaho. (Erin Collins/CBC) \nCampbell says he’s met dozens of people who have recently moved to the area, mostly from California and Colorado, because they’re frustrated with what they feel is government overreach, including rising taxes, stiffer gun regulations and the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. \nHe says he’ll likely vote for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Nov. 8, primarily because he believes a Hillary Clinton administration would erode religious freedoms and the right to bear arms. \nAnd despite the polls, Campbell believes Trump will win. If he doesn’t, he expects the Redoubt will get a lot more crowded. \n“I think we will see a great influx of people, more than we are seeing right now, multiplying by thousands, coming here for safety and refuge.” \nWith all the mudslinging and scandal that has defined this U.S. presidential campaign, perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising there’s talk of political migration. \nOnce again this election cycle, some Democrats, including several celebrities , have threatened to move to Canada should their candidate lose. \nFolks in the Redoubt suspect plenty of Trump supporters will consider a move of their own if their candidate loses, although not quite as far north. ‘People want to feel safe’ \nA short drive away, customers peruse the display cases at Ed Santos’s busy Post Falls gun shop and shooting range. They’re served by staff wearing side arms who show off everything from handguns to automatic weapons. \n‘The American Redoubt is a stronghold, it’s the last bastion for God, country, liberty, constitution, Second Amendment and home schooling.’ – Warren Campbell, owner of Redoubt Surplus and Tactical \nSantos says many of the people coming through his shop these days are new arrivals looking for a fresh start and a quieter, more peaceful life. \n“Many of the things that attracted my wife and I to this area are the same things that are attracting people today — people want to live in a place that feels like a community, people want to feel safe when they go out at night.” \nSantos, a former army officer, cop and minor pro hockey referee, says the facility is signing up new members every day, and “many of them, the vast majority of them in fact, are from out of this area.” Ed Santos fires a pistol inside the gun range attached to his Port Falls Idaho gun shop. \nMore than 300 kilometres east, that search for safety and community drew Chuck Leveque and his wife to a wooded property in the isolated foothills of Flathead County, Mont. \nThe former Las Vegas vice cop says his biggest worry is that terrorists could knock out America’s electrical grid. \nLeveque opens the creaky doors of a large shipping container in his yard to show how he’s prepared for the threat. \n“This is our fuel storage container and we have a tank with 275 gallons of diesel and a tank with 275 gallons of non-ethanol regular gasoline.” \nThe fuel will run Leveque’s generator in the event of a prolonged power outage. He says he’s stored enough food and water for him and his wife to survive for up to four years. \nBut Leveque believes he will also need to protect what he’s stored from those who are less prepared, so, like many people here in the Redoubt, he has stockpiled weapons and ammunition, too. Chuck Leveque opens up the sea lift container that holds two tanks of fuel to run his generator in case the power grid goes down. (Erin Collins/CBC) \n“The U.S., and Montana in particular, is a gun culture, and in the event of a large catastrophe, we would need the guns to defend ourselves against people who would want to take our property and our preparedness stores.” \nIn the meantime, he worries the country’s political and economic power is waning, saddled with too much debt and a political system that has ground to a halt. \nIt’s a problem he expects will get worse after the presidential campaign. \n“No matter which way the election turns out, there is going to be a lot of angst by either side.” Canning bullion and bullets \nInside a nondescript industrial mall near Kalispell, Mont., DJ Lebaron puts the finishing touches on a can of dehydrated eggs inside his store, Big Sky Preppers . \nLebaron, who is originally from southern Alberta, provides survival products and training, including how to can everything from gold bullion to bullets. \n“You want to pack them tight so that they don’t sound like bullets if somebody shakes it,” he said. \nFor Lebaron, life in the Redoubt is about hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. It’s a mantra he adopted while working with FEMA, America’s disaster management agency, during the earthquake that rocked the San Francisco Bay Area in 1989. \n“When bad things happen, people that you have called your friends for years are no longer your friends,” he said. “When people are cold, tired and hungry, they forget all about friendships.” \nHis biggest worry is that a natural disaster like an earthquake or flood will disrupt normal life in America. But he says the growing uncertainty about America’s political and economic future is a close second. \nHe says Trump presents conservatives in the Redoubt with a difficult choice this election. \n“People, if they are voting, are going to be voting for Trump, but people don’t want Trump because nobody can control him and they are worried about what he will do, so I guess I will call that a man-made disaster.” \nHe expects the divisions this presidential campaign has reinforced across the country will remain long after the election and will feed some Americans’ desire to retreat to the Redoubt. \n“There is very much a division or a schism in the United States today, where people are literally, ‘Which side of the fence are you on?'”", "output": "0.

It was Obama s green energy scam with companies like Solyndra that was like flushing millions and billions down the toilet Taxpayers are on the hook for more than $2.2 billion in expected costs from the federal government s energy loan guarantee programs, according to a new audit Monday that suggests the controversial projects may not pay for themselves, as officials had promised.Nearly $1 billion in loans have already defaulted under the Energy Department program, which included the infamous Solyndra stimulus project and dozens of other green technology programs the Obama administration has approved, totaling nearly about $30 billion in taxpayer backing, the Government Accountability Office reported in its audit.The hefty $2.2 billion price tag is actually an improvement over initial estimates, which found the government was poised to face $4 billion in losses from the loan guarantees.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Is De-industrialization a “Natural Phenomenon” of Developed Economies? Increasing real revenues affect people’s lifestyle choices Jörg Guido Hülsmann | Mises.org   \nLet me first state my position and then add a few arguments to back it up. \nEconomic growth typically entails a re-allocation of labor away from industrial production, but it does not all by itself lead to falling industrial output. The decline of industrial production in the US and France in the past thirty years is to some extent due to capital exports, but especially to government interventionism in the form of mushrooming labor, business and financial regulations, education policies, social security funding, and taxation. This decline cannot be stopped through more interventions, even if they are designed with the good intention to reindustrialize the country. \nNow let me offer a few considerations in support of these contentions. \nThe reallocation of labor in a growing economy results most notably from capital accumulation and from changing preferences of the working-age population. Further investments and extensions of the existing structure of production make it necessary to spend more time devising new methods, preparing industrial activity, coordinating and monitoring supply chains. Low-quality blue-collar labor diminishes, whereas there is some increase in high-quality blue-collars, but especially an increase in white-collars working in and around the supply chains. \nIncreasing real revenues affect people’s lifestyle choices. Rather than laboring long hours that provide essentially a monetary reward, they increasingly prefer enjoyable activities that provide immediate psychological and emotional rewards. Thus the blossoming of artistic, intellectual, and scientific activities in developed countries, at the expense of traditional industrial pursuits. \nAs a natural consequence of economic growth, therefore, industrial production declines relative to what it could be if it attracted even more people. But this does neither imply a shrinking physical industrial output, nor does it imply shrinking industrial revenues. Capital accumulation and technological progress make it possible that industry thrives even when less people have industrial employment. Germany provides an example. \nIn the past thirty years, western capitalists have invested large amounts of capital in formerly communist countries of the East and Far East. This reallocation of capital, though beneficial from the overall point of view of the world economy, has been detrimental in the short-run to the industrial development of those western countries where the capital would otherwise have been used. \nBut capital investments in countries such as France and the US have declined even more as a result of mushrooming government interventions. Welfare checks diminish the incentive to accept low-paying and non-gratifying industrial jobs. Massive subsidies for secondary and higher education artificially prolong schooling; reduce the supply of qualified manual labor; and create an artificial bias among the working-age population for scientific, intellectual, and artistic activities. Panoply of regulations have, on the one hand, increased the costs of doing business and, on the other hand, stimulated rent-seeking and manifold forms of evasion and regulatory arbitrage. Today they are feeding entire armies of lawyers, accountants, auditors, and financial advisors, all at the expense of ordinary business. \nThese tendencies cannot be stopped through so-called reindustrialization policies, which boil down to even more government spending, premised on the spurious notion that irresponsible (and often also inexperienced) politicians know best how to use the available scarce resources. Such policies have utterly failed in the past (Airbus included), and will fail in the future. Genuine reindustrialization requires more oxygen for industry.

The answers will be so irresponsible and totally false that they would soon be WhatsApped to you by your well-meaning friends and relatives as confirmed news. \n1. Why were Rs.500 and Rs.1000 demonetised ? \nThe Central government and the Finance Ministry had credible intelligence inputs that black money hoarders and terrorist networks had somehow managed to figure out that the existing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes didn’t have special computer chips to track them, and hence the government has had to come up with new rupee notes that are so technologically advanced that, quite frankly, you can use them as a debit card in all places, even in places that doesn’t have a card-swiping facility. \nNo, just kidding. The new currency doesn’t have any special feature. But you can rest assured that all Indian legal Indian tender come with the ultimate guarantee of the Indian Constitution: “I hereby promise the bearer of this currency the unfettered right to scribble stuff like ‘I love Priyanka‘ in the blank space provided for the explicit purpose” \n2. Can you give us some historical background to currencies? \nBefore the advent of metal coins and paper rupees, as you would doubtless know barter system was in vogue where people exchanged goods and services for goods and services. For example, people with cattle exchanged them with those who had, say, knife or axe. And having got a knife or axe, they used the same to threaten and get the same cattle back. Life was mostly simple and straight forward then. \nBut the problem was there were many who had nothing to offer. They all became economists and eventually came up with the concept of money. \nOkay, this is not entirely true. Some of them also became journalists. \nIndia, of course, was one of the earliest users of coins in the world, its history dating back to around 6th century BC, a period which — all Historians are unanimous on this — was very, very long back. \nCloser back in time, the Reserve Bank of India — keeping in mind its essential character — was set up on the April Fool’s Day of 1935. In those non-technological days, every rupee, except Rupee one, used to be painstakingly signed by the RBI Governor, which to this day remains his only major work. The issuance of one rupee is outside the purview of RBI, and the minting of coins has been outsourced to a metal company in Guindy Industrial Estate. \n3. In the aftermath of demonetisation , gold prices have shot up, Your views on investing one’s savings in gold \nGold has always been a traditional hedge investment against other instruments that are prone to various vagaries. The government itself has invested hugely in gold, which it uses during times of economic contingency like when having to pay bonuses for government employees during Deepavali or to meet out expenses of the President or the Vice President who have to fly to other countries on emergency goodwill mission. \nThe government is said to have reserves above 550 tonnes of gold and during Indira Gandhi’s time there was a smart move to store them as ornaments, especially in the form of kangan sets and ottianam . But the matter didn’t move forward because to this day no one knows how jewellers actually price their stuff. \n4. Enough of history. What should I do in case I am unable to withdraw cash from my bank? \nThe important thing is not to panic, at no point should you…no wait, drop that knife. Also, slapping bank employees is banned under the Income Tax Act. \n5. A friend has given me a few 1000 and 500 rupee notes to pay them in my account. Can I? \nRemember you are not supposed to remit in your account somebody else’s money, also you should not give your place in the ATM line to anybody else. If you do, 250% fine will be levied on you and your spouse. In which case, it is your sole responsibility to prove to the IT authorities that you don’t have a spouse at all. \n6. If I still have some queries on demonetisation , whom should I approach? \nYou may approach the control room of RBI by telephone (your secret pin number is written on your new notes) and the RBI will be only too happy to put your call on hold. Urjit Patel personally would like to answer your call, but at the moment he is busy signing some rupee notes.", "output": "0. Fake"}

Whether it s political power, economic power, or even military power. Ms. Risler goes on to say that the solution to the Climate crisis is to create more  just and equitable economies .Roughly translated that means an economy based along the lines of Socialism and Communism.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Election 2016 and the Growing Global Nuclear Threat Playing a Game of Chicken with Nuclear Strategy Email This Page to Someone Your Name Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => \nOnce upon a time, when choosing a new president, a factor for many voters was the perennial question: “Whose finger do you want on the nuclear button?” Of all the responsibilities of America’s top executive, none may be more momentous than deciding whether, and under what circumstances, to activate the “nuclear codes” — the secret alphanumeric messages that would inform missile officers in silos and submarines that the fearful moment had finally arrived to launch their intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) toward a foreign adversary, igniting a thermonuclear war. \nUntil recently in the post-Cold War world, however, nuclear weapons seemed to drop from sight, and that question along with it. Not any longer. In 2016, the nuclear issue is back big time, thanks both to the rise of Donald Trump ( including various unsettling comments he’s made about nuclear weapons) and actual changes in the global nuclear landscape. \nWith passions running high on both sides in this year’s election and rising fears about Donald Trump’s impulsive nature and Hillary Clinton’s hawkish one, it’s hardly surprising that the “nuclear button” question has surfaced repeatedly throughout the campaign. In one of the more pointed exchanges of the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton declared that Donald Trump lacked the mental composure for the job. “A man who can be provoked by a tweet,” she commented , “should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes.” Donald Trump has reciprocated by charging that Clinton is too prone to intervene abroad. “You’re going to end up in World War III over Syria,” he told reporters in Florida last month. \nFor most election observers, however, the matter of personal character and temperament has dominated discussions of the nuclear issue, with partisans on each side insisting that the other candidate is temperamentally unfit to exercise control over the nuclear codes. There is, however, a more important reason to worry about whose finger will be on that button this time around: at this very moment, for a variety of reasons, the “nuclear threshold” — the point at which some party to a “conventional” (non-nuclear) conflict chooses to employ atomic weapons — seems to be moving dangerously lower. \nNot so long ago, it was implausible that a major nuclear power — the United States, Russia, or China — would consider using atomic weapons in any imaginable conflict scenario. No longer. Worse yet, this is likely to be our reality for years to come, which means that the next president will face a world in which a nuclear decision-making point might arrive far sooner than anyone would have thought possible just a year or two ago — with potentially catastrophic consequences for us all. \nNo less worrisome, the major nuclear powers (and some smaller ones) are all in the process of acquiring new nuclear arms, which could, in theory, push that threshold lower still. These include a variety of cruise missiles and other delivery systems capable of being used in “limited” nuclear wars — atomic conflicts that, in theory at least, could be confined to just a single country or one area of the world (say, Eastern Europe) and so might be even easier for decision-makers to initiate. The next president will have to decide whether the U.S. should actually produce weapons of this type and also what measures should be taken in response to similar decisions by Washington’s likely adversaries. \nLowering the Nuclear Threshold \nDuring the dark days of the Cold War, nuclear strategists in the United States and the Soviet Union conjured up elaborate conflict scenarios in which military actions by the two superpowers and their allies might lead from, say, minor skirmishing along the Iron Curtain to full-scale tank combat to, in the end, the use of “battlefield” nuclear weapons, and then city-busting versions of the same to avert defeat. In some of these scenarios, strategists hypothesized about wielding “tactical” or battlefield weaponry — nukes powerful enough to wipe out a major tank formation, but not Paris or Moscow — and claimed that it would be possible to contain atomic warfare at such a devastating but still sub-apocalyptic level. (Henry Kissinger, for instance, made his reputation by preaching this lunatic doctrine in his first book, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy .) Eventually, leaders on both sides concluded that the only feasible role for their atomic arsenals was to act as deterrents to the use of such weaponry by the other side. This was, of course, the concept of “ mutually assured destruction ,” or — in one of the most classically apt acronyms of all times: MAD. It would, in the end, form the basis for all subsequent arms control agreements between the two superpowers. \nAnxiety over the escalatory potential of tactical nuclear weapons peaked in the 1970s when the Soviet Union began deploying the SS-20 intermediate-range ballistic missile (capable of striking cities in Europe, but not the U.S.) and Washington responded with plans to deploy nuclear-armed, ground-launched cruise missiles and the Pershing-II ballistic missile in Europe. The announcement of such plans provoked massive antinuclear demonstrations across Europe and the United States. On December 8, 1987, at a time when worries had been growing about how a nuclear conflagration in Europe might trigger an all-out nuclear exchange between the superpowers, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. \nThat historic agreement — the first to eliminate an entire class of nuclear delivery systems — banned the deployment of ground-based cruise or ballistic missiles with a range of 500 and 5,500 kilometers and required the destruction of all those then in existence. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation inherited the USSR’s treaty obligations and pledged to uphold the INF along with other U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements. In the view of most observers, the prospect of a nuclear war between the two countries practically vanished as both sides made deep cuts in their atomic stockpiles in accordance with already existing accords and then signed others, including the New START , the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 2010. \nToday, however, this picture has changed dramatically. The Obama administration has concluded that Russia has violated the INF treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile of prohibited range, and there is reason to believe that, in the not-too-distant future, Moscow might abandon that treaty altogether. Even more troubling, Russia has adopted a military doctrine that favors the early use of nuclear weapons if it faces defeat in a conventional war, and NATO is considering comparable measures in response. The nuclear threshold, in other words, is dropping rapidly. \nMuch of this is due, it seems, to Russian fears about its military inferiority vis-à-vis the West. In the chaotic years following the collapse of the USSR, Russian military spending plummeted and the size and quality of its forces diminished accordingly. In an effort to restore Russia’s combat capabilities, President Vladimir Putin launched a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar expansion and modernization program. The fruits of this effort were apparent in the Crimea and Ukraine in 2014, when Russian forces, however disguised, demonstrated better fighting skills and wielded better weaponry than in the Chechnya wars a decade earlier. Even Russian analysts acknowledge, however, that their military in its current state would be no match for American and NATO forces in a head-on encounter, given the West’s superior array of conventional weaponry. To fill the breach, Russian strategic doctrine now calls for the early use of nuclear weapons to offset an enemy’s superior conventional forces. \nTo put this in perspective, Russian leaders ardently believe that they are the victims of a U.S.-led drive by NATO to encircle their country and diminish its international influence. They point, in particular, to the build-up of NATO forces in the Baltic countries, involving the semi-permanent deployment of combat battalions in what was once the territory of the Soviet Union, and in apparent violation of promises made to Gorbachev in 1990 that NATO would not do so. As a result, Russia has been bolstering its defenses in areas bordering Ukraine and the Baltic states, and training its troops for a possible clash with the NATO forces stationed there. \nThis is where the nuclear threshold enters the picture. Fearing that it might be defeated in a future clash, its military strategists have called for the early use of tactical nuclear weapons, some of which no doubt would violate the INF Treaty, in order to decimate NATO forces and compel them to quit fighting. Paradoxically, in Russia, this is labeled a “ de-escalation ” strategy, as resorting to strategic nuclear attacks on the U.S. under such circumstances would inevitably result in Russia’s annihilation. On the other hand, a limited nuclear strike (so the reasoning goes) could potentially achieve success on the battlefield without igniting all-out atomic war. As Eugene Rumer of the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace explains, this strategy assumes that such supposedly “limited” nuclear strikes “will have a sobering effect on the enemy, which will then cease and desist.” \nTo what degree tactical nuclear weapons have been incorporated into Moscow’s official military doctrine remains unknown, given the degree of secrecy surrounding such matters. It is apparent, however, that the Russians have been developing the means with which to conduct such “limited” strikes. Of greatest concern to Western analysts in this regard is their deployment of the Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile, a modern version of the infamous Soviet-era “Scud” missile (used by Saddam Hussein’s forces during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988 and the Persian Gulf War of 1990-1991). Said to have a range of 500 kilometers (just within the INF limit), the Iskander can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead. As a result, a targeted country or a targeted military could never be sure which type it might be facing (and might simply assume the worst). Adding to such worries, the Russians have deployed the Iskander in Kaliningrad, a tiny chunk of Russian territory wedged between Poland and Lithuania that just happens to put it within range of many western European cities. \nIn response, NATO strategists have discussed lowering the nuclear threshold themselves, arguing — ominously enough — that the Russians will only be fully dissuaded from employing their limited-nuclear-war strategy if they know that NATO has a robust capacity to do the same. At the very least, what’s needed, some of them claim , is a more frequent inclusion of nuclear-capable or dual-use aircraft in exercises on Russia’s frontiers to “signal” NATO’s willingness to resort to limited nuclear strikes, too. Again, such moves are not yet official NATO strategy, but it’s clear that senior officials are weighing them seriously. \nJust how all of this might play out in a European crisis is, of course, unknown, but both sides in an increasingly edgy standoff are coming to accept that nuclear weapons might have a future military role, which is, of course, a recipe for almost unimaginable escalation and disaster of an apocalyptic sort. This danger is likely to become more pronounced in the years ahead because both Washington and Moscow seem remarkably intent on developing and deploying new nuclear weapons designed with just such needs in mind. \nThe New Nuclear Armaments \nBoth countries are already in the midst of ambitious and extremely costly efforts to “ modernize ” their nuclear arsenals. Of all the weapons now being developed, the two generating the most anxiety in terms of that nuclear threshold are a new Russian ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) and an advanced U.S. air-launched cruise missile (ALCM). Unlike ballistic missiles, which exit the Earth’s atmosphere before returning to strike their targets, such cruise missiles remain within the atmosphere throughout their flight. \nAmerican officials claim that the Russian GLCM, reportedly now being deployed, is of a type outlawed by the INF Treaty. Without providing specifics, the State Department indicated in a 2014 memo that it had “a range capability of 500 km [kilometers] to 5,500 km,” which would indeed put it in violation of that treaty by allowing Russian combat forces to launch nuclear warheads against cities throughout Europe and the Middle East in a “limited” nuclear war. \nThe GLCM is likely to prove one of the most vexing foreign policy issues the next president will face. So far, the White House has been reluctant to press Moscow too hard, fearing that the Russians might respond by exiting the INF Treaty altogether and so eliminate remaining constraints on its missile program. But many in Congress and among Washington’s foreign policy elite are eager to see the next occupant of the Oval Office take a tougher stance if the Russians don’t halt deployment of the missile, threatening Moscow with more severe economic sanctions or moving toward countermeasures like the deployment of enhanced anti-missile systems in Europe. The Russians would, in turn, undoubtedly perceive such moves as threats to their strategic deterrent forces and so an invitation for further weapons acquisitions, setting off a fresh round in the long-dormant Cold War nuclear arms race. \nOn the American side, the weapon of immediate concern is a new version of the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile, usually carried by B-52 bombers. Also known as the Long-Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO), it is, like the Iskander-M, expected to be deployed in both nuclear and conventional versions, leaving those on the potential receiving end unsure what might be heading their way. In other words, as with the Iskander-M, the intended target might assume the worst in a crisis, leading to the early use of nuclear weapons. Put another way, such missiles make for twitchy trigger fingers and are likely to lead to a heightened risk of nuclear war, which, once started, might in turn take Washington and Moscow right up the escalatory ladder to a planetary holocaust. \nNo wonder former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry called on President Obama to cancel the ALCM program in a recent Washington Post op-ed piece. “Because they… come in both nuclear and conventional variants,” he wrote, “cruise missiles are a uniquely destabilizing type of weapon.” And this issue is going to fall directly into the lap of the next president. \nThe New Nuclear Era \nWhoever is elected on November 8th, we are evidently all headed into a world in which Trumpian-style itchy trigger fingers could be the norm. It already looks like both Moscow and Washington will contribute significantly to this development — and they may not be alone. In response to Russian and American moves in the nuclear arena, China is reported to be developing a “ hypersonic glide vehicle ,” a new type of nuclear warhead better able to evade anti-missile defenses — something that, at a moment of heightened crisis, might make a nuclear first strike seem more attractive to Washington. And don’t forget Pakistan, which is developing its own short-range “tactical” nuclear missiles, increasing the risk of the quick escalation of any future Indo-Pakistani confrontation to a nuclear exchange. (To put such “regional” dangers in perspective, a local nuclear war in South Asia could cause a global nuclear winter and, according to one study , possibly kill a billion people worldwide, thanks to crop failures and the like.) \nAnd don’t forget North Korea, which is now testing a nuclear-armed ICBM, the Musudan, intended to strike the Western United States. That prompted a controversial decision in Washington to deploy THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile batteries in South Korea (something China bitterly opposes), as well as the consideration of other countermeasures, including undoubtedly scenarios involving first strikes against the North Koreans. \nIt’s clear that we’re on the threshold of a new nuclear era: a time when the actual use of atomic weapons is being accorded greater plausibility by military and political leaders globally, while war plans are being revised to allow the use of such weapons at an earlier stage in future armed clashes. \nAs a result, the next president will have to grapple with nuclear weapons issues — and possible nuclear crises — in a way unknown since the Cold War era. Above all else, this will require both a cool head and a sufficient command of nuclear matters to navigate competing pressures from allies, the military, politicians, pundits, and the foreign policy establishment without precipitating a nuclear conflagration. On the face of it, that should disqualify Donald Trump. When questioned on nuclear issues in the first debate, he exhibited a striking ignorance of the most basic aspects of nuclear policy. But even Hillary Clinton, for all her experience as secretary of state, is likely to have a hard time grappling with the pressures and dangers that are likely to arise in the years ahead, especially given that her inclination is to toughen U.S. policy toward Russia. \nIn other words, whoever enters the Oval Office, it may be time for the rest of us to take up those antinuclear signs long left to molder in closets and memories, and put some political pressure on leaders globally to avoid strategies and weapons that would make human life on this planet so much more precarious than it already is. \nMichael T.

It s almost hard to forget when the last time filling up at the tank was a burdensome thing   that s because nearly two years has gone by since gas was over $3.00 a gallon (on average across the United States). Over the last year or so, gas prices have dropped even further, due to Saudia Arabia continuing to keep up output, and the Iran deal that is expected to glut the global market even more so. All of this is great news   but it looks like the good news will keep on flowing (pun intended) according to experts in the industry.The AAA and GasBuddy, two top organizations that follow gasoline prices, say that if refinery capacity stays strong the price of a gallon of gasoline could reach historic lows of $1.00 a gallon in some areas   a level that hasn t been reached since 1999. That would be quite a remarkable event.Prices are already low by historical standards and depending on which part of the country you live in, already under $2.00 a gallon. If you look at the map below, you will easily be able to see which parts of the United States already receive the cheapest gas. There are very few areas colored in dark green (lower than $1.38 a  gallon). Most of the middle part of the country is either light green ($1.68-$1.83), or yellow ($1.83-$1.98). If gas is pushed downward to $1.00 a gallon, that s still a huge percentage drop no matter where you live.Pic via Gas BuddyGas prices are mostly driven by four things: oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity and state taxes and levies.We already know that crude oil prices are going to continue to fall. Although, there are a few detractors, there always are. Nevermind that   here s what the money managers that run the economy are doing: while 6,346 of them bet on higher prices (okay   fair enough) 17,517 of them bet on lower prices. It s not even close. This is the least bullish investors have been on oil in more than five years, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.All in all, gasoline futures fell 1.83 cents or 1.6%, to $1.12 a gallon   the lowest it s been since February 2009. And   gasoline also fell 14.33 cents a gallon (11% for the week) which also happens to be the largest weekly loss since September 2009.If the experts are right, $1.00 a gallon gasoline may not be that far off.

Therefore, parliament has already had a say in the EU referendum, and by going to the High Court, these traitors have sought to annul a democratic vote which was held on June 23 2016. \nThis ruling is a shameful reminder that Britain has lost all sovereign status to the EU entity, it is a sad day for democracy, for the will of the people and ultimately for the country. \n17.5 Million People Will Vote on Election Day \nIn these circumstances, we must as a people show our displeasure at being circumvented by not voting during the next election for any MP or party who is EU centric. \nThis is not over.", "output": "0.

The Crown reported that Pickton told the officer that he wanted to kill another woman to make it an even 50, and that he was caught because he was \"sloppy\".[9] Background[edit] \n\nBy 1992, Robert William Pickton and his brother David owned a Port Coquitlam farm. Worker Bill Hiscox called it a \"creepy-looking place\", noting that it was patrolled by a 600-lb. (270 kg) boar , one of the few actual pigs on the farm. \"I never saw a pig like that, who would chase you and bite at you,\" he said. \"It was running out with the dogs around the property.\" He later described Pickton as a \"pretty quiet guy, hard to strike up a conversation with,\" whose occasionally bizarre behavior, despite no evidence of substance abuse , would draw attention. \n\nPickton's only vehicle was a converted bus, with deeply tinted windows, to which he was emotionally attached. The Pickton brothers gradually neglected the site's farming operations. They registered a non-profit charity, the Piggy Palace Good Times Society, with the Canadian government in 1996 as aiming to \"organize, co-ordinate, manage and operate special events, functions, dances, shows and exhibitions on behalf of service organizations, sports organizations and other worthy groups.\" Its events included raves and wild parties featuring Vancouver prostitutes and gatherings in a converted slaughterhouse. These events attracted as many as 2,000 people. Hell's Angel members were known to often frequent the farm.\" \n\n\"650,000 Emails Found On Anthony Weiner's Laptop; DOJ Blocked Foundation Probe   \nby Tyler Durden   \nOct 30, 2016 10:34 PM  \nYesterday, we reported that the FBI has found \" tens of thousands of emails \" belonging to Huma Adein on Anthony Weiner's computer, raising questions how practical it is that any conclusive finding will be available or made by the FBI in the few days left before the elections Now, according to the WSJ , it appears that Federal agents are preparing to scour roughly 650,000 emails that, as we reported moments ago were discovered weeks ago on the laptop of Anthony Weiner , to see how many relate to a prior probe of Hillary Clinton's email use, as metadata on the device suggests there may be thousands sent to or from the private server that the Democratic nominee used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter. \n\nAs the WSJ adds, the review will take weeks at a minimum to determine whether those messages are work-related emails between Huma Abedin, a close Clinton aide and the estranged wife of Mr. Weiner, and State Department officials; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the Clinton email probe, which FBI officials call \"Midyear.\" \n\nAnd, as we further reported earlier today , the FBI has had to await a court order to begin reviewing the emails, because they were uncovered in an unrelated probe of Mr. Weiner, and that order was delayed for reasons that remain unclear. \n\nMore stunning is just how many emails were found on Weiner's computer. And while one can only imagine the content of some of the more persona ones, the WSJ writes that the latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau's second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a minor, they had recovered a laptop with 650,000 emails. Many, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter. \n\nThose emails stretched back years , these people said, and were on a laptop that both Mr. Weiner and Ms. Abedin used and that hadn't previously come up in the Clinton email probe. Ms. Abedin said in late August that the couple were separating. \n\nThe FBI had searched the computer while looking for child pornography, people familiar with the matter said, but the warrant they used didn't give them authority to search for matters related to Mrs. Clinton's email arrangement at the State Department. Mr. Weiner has denied sending explicit or indecent messages to the teenager. \n\nAs reported yesterday, it appears that there are potentially tens of thousands of Abedin linked emails on Weiner's computer: \n\nIn their initial review of the laptop, the metadata showed many messages, apparently in the thousands, that were either sent to or from the private email server at Mrs. Clinton's home that had been the focus of so much investigative effort for the FBI. Senior FBI officials decided to let the Weiner investigators proceed with a closer examination of the metadata on the computer, and report back to them. \n\nThe WSJ then connects the dots between how the Weiner emails were linked to the Clinton reopening of the Clinton probe, despite Loretta Lynch's and the DOJ's vocal urges not to do so : \n\nAt a meeting early last week of senior Justice Department and FBI officials, a member of the department’s senior national-security staff asked for an update on the Weiner laptop, the people familiar with the matter said. At that point, officials realized that no one had acted to obtain a warrant, these people said. \n\nMr. McCabe then instructed the email investigators to talk to the Weiner investigators and see whether the laptop’s contents could be relevant to the Clinton email probe, these people said. After the investigators spoke, the agents agreed it was potentially relevant. \n\nMr. Comey was given an update, decided to go forward with the case and notified Congress on Friday, with explosive results. Senior Justice Department officials had warned Mr. Comey that telling Congress would violate well-established policies against overt actions that could affect an election, and some within the FBI have been unhappy at Mr. Comey's repeated public statements on the probe, going back to his first press conference on the subject in July. \n\nBut wait it gets better. \n\nRecall that this is the same Andrew Mcabe whose wife the Wall Street Journal reported last week received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 from the political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons and, until he was elected governor in November 2013, a Clinton Foundation board member. \n\nMr. McAuliffe had supported Dr. McCabe in the hopes she and a handful of other Democrats might help win a majority in the state Senate, giving Mr. McAuliffe more sway in the state capitol. Dr. McCabe lost her race last November, and Democrats failed to win their majority. \n\nFBI officials have said Mr. McCabe had no role in the Clinton email probe until he became deputy director, and there was no conflict of interest because by then his wife's campaign was over. Which brings us to the second big topic: the Clinton Foundation, and how the DOJ made sure that particular probe never made the light of day. At the same time as the Clinton server was being investigated, other Clinton-related investigations were under way within the FBI, and they have been the subject of internal debate for months. \n\nEarly this year, four FBI field offices—New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Little Rock, Ark.—were collecting information about the Clinton Foundation to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling, according to people familiar with the matter. \n\nThe WSJ touches on something fascinating: Los Angeles agents had picked up information about the Clinton Foundation from an unrelated public corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation, these people said. So where did that trail go? Apparently nowhere. \n\nThe Washington field office was probing financial relationships involving Mr. McAuliffe before he became a Clinton Foundation board member, these people said. Mr. McAuliffe has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity. The FBI field office in New York had done the most work on the Clinton Foundation case and received help from the FBI field office in Little Rock, the people familiar with the matter said. \n\nIn February, FBI officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didn't go well. \n\nSome said that is because the FBI didn’t present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the Clinton Foundation, and that the career public integrity prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn't a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case. \n\n\"That was one of the weirdest meetings I've ever been to,\" one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter. \n\nNeedless to say, the probe into the Foundation faded. \n\nBut back to the Clinton probe, according to a person familiar with the probes, on Aug. 12, a senior Justice Department official called Mr. McCabe to voice his displeasure at finding that New York FBI agents were still openly pursuing the Clinton Foundation probe, despite the department's refusal to allow more aggressive investigative methods in the case. Mr. McCabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didn’t use those methods. \n\nAt this point a question emerges: did McCabe seek to defend or press on with a Clinton probe: Mr. McCabe’s defenders in the agency said that following the call, he repeated the instruction that he had given earlier in the Clinton Foundation investigation: Agents were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had. \n\nOthers further down the FBI chain of command, however, said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case: “Stand down.” When agents questioned why they weren’t allowed to take more aggressive steps, they said they were told the order had come from the deputy director—Mr. McCabe. Others familiar with the matter deny Mr. McCabe or any other senior FBI official gave such a stand-down instruction. \n\nAt this point the two probes, into Hillary's email and the Clinton Foundation converged: \n\nFor agents who already felt uneasy about FBI leadership’s handling of the Clinton Foundation case, the moment only deepened their concerns, these people said. For those who felt the probe hadn’t yet found significant evidence of criminal conduct, the leadership’s approach was the right response to the facts on the ground. \n\nThings accelerated over the past two months, when in September, agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on nongovernment laptops that had been searched as part of the Clinton email case, but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn. Those emails were given to the FBI based on grants of partial immunity and limited-use agreements, meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of classified information. \n\nSome FBI agents were dissatisfied with that answer, and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe, these people said, told them no and added that they could not “go prosecutor-shopping.\" \n\nNot long after that discussion, FBI agents informed the bureau’s leaders about the Weiner laptop, prompting Mr. Comey's disclosure to Congress and setting of the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign \n\nWhile much of the latest developments are known, or could have been inferred assuming more corruption within government agencies, the punchline is that the weeks if not months of upcoming work means that if Clinton wins the White House, she will likely do so amid at least one ongoing investigation into her inner circle being handled by law-enforcement officials who are deeply divided over how to manage such cases. It also means that Trump will be hounding Hilllary for the remainder of the campaign as being the only presidential candidate to seek election with a recently reopened criminal probe hanging over her head.\" \n\n\" Serco Processes 2 Millionth Patent Application for U.S. Patent and Trademark  \nOffice Date: 18 Mar 2013 Serco Inc., a leading provider of professional, technology, and management services to the federal government, announced today that their Pre-Grant Publication (PGPubs) Classification Services team recently processed their 2 millionth patent application for the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO).

The participants would be expected to be familiar with the plans and procedures that are being used although the exercise tempo and complexity can be adjusted to suit the current state of training and readiness. Simulation and media play can be used to support the exercise. Table-top exercises help develop teamwork and allow participants to gain a better understanding of their roles and that of other agencies and organisations.

While his actions eventually helped to highlight the terrible crime against the young woman and helped to bring the perpetrators to justice, he has received no thanks from law enforcement who have instead elected to put him on trial for felony hacking. If he is found guilty, he will face up to sixteen years in prison. Incidentally, the rapists who were also found guilty at trial have already completed their exceptionally short detention sentences. Steubenville hacker indicted for bringing rapists to justice \nThe sobering details of the Steubenville rape case were detailed heavily in 2013 when the perpetrators came to trial. Members of a local football team gang raped a high school girl and posted pictures, and social media posts are bragging about they had done to her. Only two of the perpetrators were ever arrested on charges of rape and kidnap, Trent May and Ma’Lik Richmond, both of whom received far more local support then their victim. \nInitially, local authorities showed a reluctance to prosecute any of the perpetrators of this senseless and violent act owing to their privileged place in local society. This led to international outrage and eventually a group called KnightSec, which is affiliated to Anonymous decided to step in. They hacked into the Steubenville High School sports fan website and exposed the cover-up by school administrators and the identities of the girl’s attackers. They also posted a video of several students making light of the rape victim. They threatened to expose more individuals associated with the cover-up if the rapists did not come forward and confess. Eventually, two young men did come forward and were convicted of the rape of a minor. Ma’Lik Richmond served a paltry ten-month spell at the juvenile detention facility, and Trent May served two years . \nAccording to Tor Ekeland, a lawyer speaking for Lostutter, he and his client were both incredibly surprised that he had been targeted by the FBI about this hacking. He said; “I don’t understand why they are prosecuting somebody who helped expose the rape of a minor… This is not a situation where somebody, you know, hacked a hospital or took down a nuclear power plant. This was an act of political protest against the rape of a 16-year-old girl.” \nNow Lostutter must wait and see whether he will face the full sixteen years in prison that his ‘crime’ can carry. Naturally, his supporters are appalled. “You get 16 years for forcibly entering your way into a computer, but you get one year for forcibly entering your way into a woman. I think that’s the precedent the government is setting here, ” said Ekeland. \nThis article (Anonymous hacker Deric Lostutter faces 16 years in prison, while Steubenville rapists walk free) is free and open source.

Migration Watch said the costs will continue to rocket if a “sustainable” level of migration is not achieved. UK Daily Mail More than 11,000 households are raking in benefits that are at least the equivalent of a higher rate taxpayers’ £47,000 salary, it was revealed last month. According to official figures, thousands of Muslim migrant families on benefits are living in luxury homes, with many receiving housing handouts of about £5,000 per month – enough to fund a £1million mortgage. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they’ve ever actually earned themselves. UK Express (h/t Rob E) A spokesperson said: “There is a long standing controversy over the granting of social housing to immigrants. This has not been helped by local authorities’ reluctance to publish the relevant information. “Some immigrant groups have very low use of social housing whereas others are more likely to be in social housing than the UK born. There is absolutely nothing in the rules that state that immigrants should get preferential treatment. “However, priority for social housing is largely determined by need and so some ‘high need’ immigrant families (with multiple wives and large litters of kids) will gain access to housing over longer standing local residents deemed to be of lower need. This can be contentious. The 100,000 pre-fab homes(below) proposed by the Government are a far cry from those properties “fit for heroes” and service personnel who were awarded social housing on their return from the horrors of the First World War. “In the future, any housing strategy must address both supply and demand. The Muslim invasion is a major part of housing demand. “Unless net migration is reduced to a manageable and sustainable level a large house building programme will have to continue indefinitely, with all the costs and loss of amenities involved.” A white paper due out next month includes measures to encourage banks to lend to firms which construct off-site before delivering them to their final destination. A Government source said: “The first and most obvious advantage is speeding up the building of housing. “There is pretty good evidence that if you did it at scale it is cheaper.” This has pushed ministers to plan a new wave of pre-made homes to solve the housing crisis. The prefabricated homes can be built off site in as little as a day and take just 48 hours to install on a site. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than they’ve ever actually earned themselves. But today when approximately 9,000 of our servicemen and women are sleeping rough after leaving the military, Government figures show how an influx of Muslims has seen 30,000 social housing lettings given to immigrants in 2015. Outrage as Afghan War hero who guarded the Queen is thrown out of council home From 2015, Jamie Streets, 34, spent 15 years in the Household Cavalry and suffered brain damage while on duty. But he, his wife Charmaine and their four children are to be kicked out of temporary accommodation after Cornwall County Council denied them a permanent home. Mr Streets served in both Kosovo and Afghanistan and escorted the Queen on ceremonial duty, holding the rank of corporal of horse. But he was discharged on medical grounds last year after suffering serious head injuries and a brain tumor. Although he recovered enough to return to work, he then suffered a seizure and had to leave the Army. Sorry, we decided that unemployed Muslim colonizers deserve a nicer home than war heroes In an open letter to the Prime Minister and Cornwall Council’s chief executive Andrew Kerr, the Household Cavalry Veterans Association says it is “incensed”. Signed by Secretary Rob Mather, the letter claims taxpayers’ money is spent on “lavish lifestyles and foreign aid”, while “serious issues on our own doorstep are not resolved”. “This is not acceptable treatment of one who served his Queen and country.” The seven-bedroom home in Acton, West London, where an Afghan Muslim family were placed at a cost of £2,875 a week to taxpayers UK: Muslim Welfare ‘Refugees’ Trash The £1.25 Million Home They Are Living In For Free And Laugh About It A family of PALESTINIAN MUSLIM freeloaders provoked outrage yesterday by saying they “deserve” to live in a £1.25 million taxpayer-funded luxury home (above) despite trashing it. The mother, Mrs Mahmoud, gets £20,000 a year in housing benefits to pay her rent. Yet she said: “I don’t care if people think I am not grateful. I am entitled to live in a house like this even if I don’t pay for it. “I deserve to live in a nice house and get benefits because I am human.” The family is one of at least 100 unemployed Muslim invaders living in homes on state handouts that could fund £1million mortgages. Muslim mother of eight was placed in a £2.6m house in Notting Hill, west London at the taxpayers’ expense She has since split with her husband and was given British citizenship five years ago but has never worked in this country. She moved with her two sons and five daughters to the three-bedroom house in Fulham, west London, three years ago. It had just undergone a £76,000 refurbishment, half paid for by the taxpayer. She claims her family is being persecuted because neighbours “don’t want a foreigner to come and live in this street.” Thanks for the nice council house, suckers. Migration Watch said the costs will continue to rocket if a “sustainable” level of migration is not achieved.

He also fears that he wouldn t be welcome here anymore.

He should replace Scott Pruitt at the Environment Protection Agency,  he said.  Climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it s one we can prevent. It affects America badly, so tackling it should win votes for his second term. God forbid. As a citizen of the U.K., which recently voted to leave the European Union for reasons very similar to the impetus behind Trump s election, he understands the feeling of being left behind and the fear of globalism, but he doesn t respect it. Trump was elected by people who felt disenfranchised by the governing elite in a revolt against globalisation,  he told ITV1 s breakfast programme.  His priority will be to satisfy his electorate, who are neither liberal nor that well informed. Here s the video: Hawking has reasons to be afraid. Trump s cabinet picks and budget are about as hostile to the scientific community as they can be, but we desperately need people like Hawking to stand up to Trump and to the ignorant masses who elected him.

After a mostly incoherent interview published in the New York Times, and after a revelation that Trump is going around asking if he could pardon his family and even himself, rats have begun abandoning the sinking ship.It started early on Friday morning, when Trump s beleaguered Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, announced his resignation because he objected to his new boss, Anthony Scaramucci. The shakeup had only begun. By the afternoon, Trump s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz, also resigned after being demoted from heading the Russia defense and after, in the New York Times interview, Trump threatened special counsel Robert Mueller against going after Trump family finances.In an interview with MSNBC, Times reporter Peter Baker said this about Trump s legal team: People around him definitely are. This is, in fact, connected to the other thing you were talking about, the sort of blowup of the legal team. some of the lawyers told him don t go after Robert Mueller. First of all, this guy is a good guy, he is a smart guy, a person of integrity. In fact, some of the lawyers have said to the president, in effect, if you didn t do anything wrong and we think you don t have anything to worry about in terms of the Russia investigation, then you should want Robert Mueller at your special counsel, because if he finds that, if that s his conclusion, it will have credibility on both sides of the aisle, so don t do that. Baker was proven right on Friday when Kasowitz left the team after it was announced that Ty Cobb would be heading the defense.This also points to a change in legal strategy, and that means that Mueller, if not outright fired, will be in the crosshairs. The goal will be to dig up any bit of dirt and any perceived conflict of interest to discredit him. All of that points to just one thing   guilt. If Trump, his family and his associates were innocent, they would, as his legal team said, welcome the investigation and discrediting Mueller would only put a cloud over any sort of exoneration. Now there s no question. We can be sure now that there won t be an exoneration.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images", "output": "0. Fake"}

They have the remarkable capacity to shift our understanding of the vast and complex world in which we live, most of the time presenting us with powerfully relevant information, a previously unknown perspective, and hopefully, a new choice to make a difference. The following list of documentaries showcases films that may inspire a new outlook on the world we live in. There were so many to choose from that compiling this list proved challenging, however, each one of these films stands as prudent commentaries offering valuable insight into the wonders and workings of the world at large. Enjoy! 1) Hungry For Change “Hungry For Change exposes shocking secrets the diet, weight loss and food industry don’t want you to know about; deceptive strategies designed to keep you coming back for more. Find ut what’s keeping you from having the body and health you deserve and how to escape the diet trap forever.” 2) Fed Up “Everything we’ve been told about food and exercise for the past 30 years is dead wrong. FED UP is the film the food industry doesn’t want you to see. From Katie Couric, Laurie David (Oscar winning producer of AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH) and director Stephanie Soechtig, FED UP will change the way you eat forever.”   3) Tiny “TINY is a documentary about home, and how we find it. The film follows one couple’s attempt to build a “tiny house” from scratch, and profiles other families who have downsized their lives into homes smaller than the average parking space. Through homes stripped down to their essentials, the film raises questions about good design, the nature of home, and the changing American Dream.” 4) Cosmos ”‘Family Guy’ creator Seth MacFarlane, in a departure from the type of material he is best known for, pays homage to Carl Sagan’s award-winning and iconic ‘Cosmos’ with this docu-series. Through stories of humankind’s quest for knowledge, viewers travel across the universe. Scientific concepts are presented clearly, with both skepticism and wonder, to impart their full impact. Renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson hosts, and Sagan’s original creative collaborator, Ann Druyan, serves as an executive producer.” 5) Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead “100 pounds overweight, loaded up on steroids and suffering from a debilitating autoimmune disease, Joe Cross is at the end of his rope and the end of his hope. In the mirror he saw a 310lb man whose gut was bigger than a beach ball and a path laid out before him that wouldn’t end well— with one foot already in the grave, the other wasn’t far behind. FAT, SICK & NEARLY DEAD is an inspiring film that chronicles Joe’s personal mission to regain his health.” 6. Forks Over Knives “Forks Over Knives examines the profound claim that most, if not all, of the degenerative diseases that afflict us can be controlled, or even reversed, by rejecting our present menu of animal-based and processed foods. The major storyline in the film traces the personal journeys of a pair of pioneering yet under-appreciated researchers, Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn.” 7) Cowspiracy “Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret is a groundbreaking feature-length environmental documentary following intrepid filmmaker Kip Andersen as he uncovers the most destructive industry facing the planet today – and investigates why the world’s leading environmental organizations are too afraid to talk about it.” 8) In Plane Sight “911: In Plane Site: Director’s Cut is a 2004 documentary which promotes 9/11 conspiracy theories. Photographs and video footage from the September 11 attacks are presented and the documentary claims that the public was not given all of the facts surrounding the terrorist attack.” 9) Pump “This is the movie that will change your attitude about fuel forever. PUMP is an inspiring, eye-opening documentary that tells the story of America’s addiction to oil, from Standard Oil’s illegal tactics to the monopoly oil companies enjoy today. The film explains clearly and simply how we can end this monopoly — and finally win choice at the pump.” 10) The Human Experiment “The Human Experiment lifts the veil on the shocking reality that thousands of untested chemicals are in our everyday products, our homes and inside of us. Simultaneously, the prevalence of many diseases continues to rise. From Oscar® winner Sean Penn and Emmy® winning journalists Dana Nachman and Don Hardy, The Human Experiment tells the personal stories of people who believe their lives have been affected by chemicals and takes viewers to the front lines as activists go head-to-head with the powerful and well-funded chemical industry. These activists bring to light a corrupt system that’s been hidden from consumers… until now.” Have you seen any movies on Netflix lately that you feel deserve to be on this list?

The following list of documentaries showcases films that may inspire a new outlook on the world we live in. There were so many to choose from that compiling this list proved challenging, however, each one of these films stands as prudent commentaries offering valuable insight into the wonders and workings of the world at large. Enjoy! 11) Life: The BBC Mini-Series A vast majority of people live their lives exiled from the wonders of nature and the myriad of living creatures that inhabit our incredibly diverse biosphere. Not to worry, however, as this wonder is magnificently captured in the 2009 BBC mini-series, Life. Shot in crystal clear high-definition and narrated by the world’s most beloved narrator himself, David Attenborough, the series chronicles some of the most unusual, if not downright bizarre, behaviors that living organisms h ave devised to keep their species alive. The massive project took 4 years to shoot and put together, taking brave camera crews across every continent and habitat imaginable. Get your popcorn ready and prepare for your mind to be blown. 12) The Zeitgeist Trilogy Commonly pegged as the films that ignited a global awakening, the Zeitgeist Trilogy quickly opened a public discourse into the largest “conspiracies” to brace the modern day world. Narrated by the enigmatic filmmaker and social activist, Peter Joseph, the film audaciously exposes the high-ordered corruption in all aspects of finance, religion, and politics today, inspiring the masses to open their eyes to the the inner workings of the global tyranny ruling our world. The series leaves the viewer with a whetted appetite for more, making this documentary film series a can of worms only for the brave and ready. 13) The Square By now, we have undoubtedly heard about the horrendous ongoing conflict in Egypt through the mainstream lens, but rarely have we gotten the chance to see an inside perspective from the men, women and children who are actually experiencing the carnage and chaos. The 2013 documentary, The Square, does just this. Audiences get a compelling inside look at the cascading series of revolutions and counter-revolutions that have shaken Egypt since the beginning of 2011, shattering routine bias commonly imposed by the mainstream media. We see the humanness of the Egyptian conflict like never before, a frightening reality that reminds us of the possibilities any country could experience in the face of governmental defiance. 14) I Am Known for his clever knack for ridiculous humour, filmmaker Tom Shadyac’s resume of films include blockbuster hits like The Nutty Professor, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, and Bruce Almighty . But after a 2007 biking accident left him with a series of insistent headaches and a painful sensitivity to light, Tom was forced to spend a 6-month period bed-ridden, in complete darkness. Once Tom recovered, he found himself with a new perspective and a slew of burning questions about life. This prompted his journey into the realm of documentary film-making, spawning the film I Am. The film asks two central questions: “ What’s Wrong With the World?” and “ What Can We Do About it?”, picking the brains of a cast of intriguing and insightful public figures. The themes explored in I Am make important food for thought for everyone. 15) Samsara Samsara also made a previous list of life changing films we wrote about, seen here , due to its success in capturing the unfathomable reaches of humanity’s spirituality and the human experience. Neither a traditional documentary nor a travelogue, Samsara takes the form of a nonverbal, visionary inspired guided meditation. From the mundane to the extraordinary, prepare for a journey around the world like nothing you’ve seen before. 16) Earthlings Coming in at number 5 is a film that changed my life only 20 minutes in. Earthlings is one of those films you cannot walk away from unaffected, exposing a reality so often swept under the rug by most. Some of the largest industries in our world today operate from the exploitation and slaughter of billions of animals annually, and this film exposes these gruesome and oft-ignored facets of society. The film does well at showing how all living beings on this planet are ‘earthlings,’ and that somewhere along the way we’ve severed our connection to animals to a sadistic degree. If you are ready, watch this film and prepare for a massive wake-up call. 17) Life In A Day Life In A Day takes the number 3 spot for a few reasons. The first reason is due to it’s incredibly original concept – an arranged series of video clips selected from 80,000 clips submitted to YouTube, the clips showing respective occurrences from around the world on a single day, July 24, 2010. The second reason is due to the sheer magnitude and global perspective it provides the audience with. The film leaves you with a feeling of connectedness, having seen the diversity and rawness of humanity and the windows into different lives, capturing moments humourous and sad, ordinary and momentous. 18) Revolution Revolution is an urgent call to action over the looming ecological collapse. It presents the idea that all of our actions are interconnected and that environmental degradation, species loss, ocean acidification, pollution, and scarcity of food and water are limiting, even reducing, the Earth’s ability to support humans. What is particularly important about this film is the director’s passion to get this message across to our youth, the ones who will be left to deal with the mess of previous generation’s decisions. Revolution is a film that should no doubt be mandatory for high school and university students to watch, whence the future policy makers emerge, to hopefully one day make a difference. 19) Planet Earth What other documentary would you expect to take the top spot on our list other than BBC`s Planet Earth ? The series is probably the most breath-taking visualization of our planet ever conceptualized. Comprised of eleven episodes, each features a global overview of a different biome or habitat on Earth captured in stunning high-definition. Planet Earth comes in at number one for the sole reason that it gives us a truly epic perspective on the world we live in, and reminds us of how freaking awesome and sacred our planet truly is. \n\nThe Sacred Science follows eight people from around the world, with varying physical and psychological illnesses, as they embark on a one-month healing journey into the heart of the Amazon jungle. \nYou can watch this documentary film FREE for 10 days by clicking here. \n\"If “Survivor” was actually real and had stakes worth caring about, it would be what happens here, and “The Sacred Science” hopefully is merely one in a long line of exciting endeavors from this group.\" - Billy Okeefe, McClatchy Tribune", "output": "0.

When the Democrats complain about Donald Trump, they only need to find a mirror, to help them understand why he is so wildly popular with Americans who are sick and tired of the Washington cesspool Donna Brazile says in her new book the Democratic National Committee (DNC) went against professional advice and sat idly for a month while Russians stole data because primaries were still underway in a number of states.In May, when CrowdStrike recommended that we take down our system and rebuild it, the DNC told them to wait a month, because the state primaries for the presidential election were still underway, and the party and the staff needed to be at their computers to manage these efforts,  Brazile wrote in her new book,  Hacks. For a whole month, CrowdStrike watched Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear operating. Cozy Bear was the hacking force that had been in the DNC system for nearly a year. Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear are cybersecurity firms that have reported ties with Russian hackers. Both groups are blamed for the hacks on the DNC in 2016. CrowdStrike is a private U.S. cybersecurity firm that oversaw the protection of the DNC s servers.The DNC was under the leadership of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida in May 2016 the time Brazile is describing in the passage. Shultz resigned in July, notably, over a series of leaked emails that showed DNC officials colluding to undermine Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont s campaign.Brazile s comments, if true, show that the DNC s privately contracted cybersecurity firm advised the Wasserman Schultz -led committee to break down and rebuild its cyber operation to protect against alleged threats. The DNC chose to go against the advice in order to see the Democratic primaries play out, which ended with Clinton becoming the Democrats  nominee.For entire story: Daily Caller", "output": "0.

Sure, it makes absolutely zero sense that they would try to silence someone who allegedly already said all he wanted to say, but that didn t get past the far-right and the far-left. The murder was covered up, according to conspiracy theorists, to make it look like a botched robbery where nothing was taken. Now, it looks like Rich was murdered by a serial killer. According to Newsweek:The researchers believe there was just one shooter. That shooter could have been a serial killer or serial murderer, according to the report, which uses the FBI s definition for an offender who kills two or more people in separate events.  With such a sanitized crime scene and no emotional indications,  the report says,  this is not Offender[ s] first kill. Investigators brush off the idea that it was a murder for hire because professionals typically do a better job.As for the conspiracy theories, the Profiling Project says those are unfounded, given that Rich did not die immediately at the scene:  A professional killer, whose sole job would have been to terminate Seth, did not accomplish their mission prior to escaping. If this were a professional hit person, they failed,  says Doherty, the team member.  Nothing we ve seen supports [the theory of] an assassin. Of course, conspiracy theorists won t be satisfied. Hillary Clinton s White House win just had to come from nefarious means. Oh wait, Clinton isn t in the White House. Instead, every intelligence agency in this country thinks Trump is in the White House because of at least partially nefarious means and even he isn t being accused of murder.Featured image via Twitter.", "output": "0.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: We are the Anunnaki’s sons, and have been given a push in our development by those minor gods. We are not alone in the Universe, and there exists Entities that are more advanced than us. Those Entities have been watching us and visiting periodically our Planet. All our Religions, that in a certain way teach basically the same, need to be reformulated, as in some cases we have been calling god some of those higher Entities\n\nAll that, and much more, is engraved in thousands of tablets that have survived for more than 5.000 years, preserved in the best possible way, as burnt clay! Those clay tablets were cooked by the fire of the library of Nineveh, and by that abnormal fact, were then given an extra resistance to endure time!\n\n\nThe big question is then, who is the Anunnaki’s God? The real Universal God? \n\nThe Real Universal God is a much more abstract one and is the togetherness of all Universal Consciousness. The Holly Spirit, the togetherness of all consciousness, is the Universal God, but by being such an abstract idea people have tended to forget, and revert to more humanized types of gods.\n\nQuantum Theory tells us than man go on creating his own world, and in it resides the source of man free will.\n\nWe can by our conscience influence the way the wave will collapse. Everything being waves means we are all part of a Universal net, where anyone influences everyone! Evil is a man’s creation. The USA Military and economic cartels have kept some very important discoveries, particularly in the field of Energy generation, hidden from us, for more than 40 years.\n\nTo have no doubts about this so delicate and important subject, read the book that Steven M. Greer just published, called “Disclosure”. Steven is a M.D. Doctor, working in the emergency room of an American Hospital, who since 1993 has dedicated most of his time trying to force the American and other Governments to disclose all the facts they have hidden about Human contacts with Alien entities. \n\nAfter reading his last book, you will be terrible scared, but deeply convinced that something very big and important has been kept hidden for too long, and so well hidden that even some American Presidents knew very little about it!\n\nThe late President Eisenhower in his last speech to the Country, in January 1961, alerted about the dangers of the “huge industrial and military machinery of defense”. This machinery does not respect anyone, not even the USA President, who they feel is a transitory person, while they are permanent ones. They have created a real perfect secret environment, where no one has the vision of the global, and neither the capacity to unblock the system.\n\nThis covert program is so well protected that today, there is not in the USA anyone capable to give an order to disclose it!\n\nUnbelievable as it may be, one of the reasons why the secret has been so well kept, is that today it is hard to find who can reveal it, or who has the key to open the vaults of the secret! Its control has run out of the governments and no democratic institution has the power, or knowledge, to control it. The biggest reaction to the disclosure of such a secret comes in the first place from the political power, which is dead scared of the consequences such world socio-economical changes will generate\n\nMaybe we can keep this secret till this generation dies, but no doubt we will transmit a moribund planet to our sons and all futures generations. The consequences of avoiding the problem are too high to risk.\n\nThe Earth is becoming polluted beyond repair, with 6 billion people wishing to have access to all modern amenities; our fossil energies will be depleted in no more than 20 years. So, by now we know who we are, who re-made us, or gave us a push in the evolution scale, and who those so funny and fierce gods, we were for so long mistook with the real God. \n\nWe also have now an idea how the Churches should be reformulated in order as to be able to keep having a place in this new society. We know that certain knowledge, given to us by Entities from another planet, should be soon disclosed, as with it we still can avoid the Earth destruction by pollution and fossil energy exhaustion. We have in our hands the ways to leave to our sons and grandsons a better and cleaner world, and just because of such an egoistic scare, we have no right to cowardly, like Nero enjoying the sight of Rome in flames, keep just for ourselves the last days of our Planet Earth.\n\nWe know that to arrive safely to the end, we have to be very cautious and follow a very narrow way The Universe has plenty of time for itself, and if we fail, others will win and pass the bridge safely. The end result is in our hands.\n\nAs Neil Freer says in “God Games”:\n\n“We are entering now the end game phase!”\n\nLocklip \nSOURCE", "output": "0. Fake"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: 21st Century Wire says Amid the tossing and turning of media hit pieces and partisan mud slinging in advance of the US presidential vote in November, very little focus is given on the actual record and policies of Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State.With this week s damning revelations regarding Gulf Arab monarchs buying access into the US State Dept via the Clinton Foundation, a clearer picture is now emerging about how the sponsorship of religious extremism, as well as geopolitical instability in the Middle East and beyond   links directly back to the Clinton global network of international oligarchs. Watch this week s ABC News segment: Based on this line of inquiry, what will four years of a Clinton presidency bring in terms of US foreign policy? A few answers to this question from Global Research  Andre Vltchek Global ResearchIf the West in general and the United States in particular, left the Arab and Muslim world alone and in peace, we would most likely never see all those terrorist attacks, which are rocking the world from Indonesia to France. There would be no Mujahedeen and its mutation into al-Qaeda; in Afghanistan or elsewhere. There would be no traces of the ISIS (or ISIL or I.S. or Daesh or however you choose to call it), in Syria, Iraq, Libya or anywhere else.And the super-conservative Wahhabi Islam, that outdated, freak Saudi mutant, would remain in the religious schools of the ultra-regressive Kingdom, instead of gaining ground all over Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.Secular IslamBut the West embarked on a brutal, Machiavellian path: it decided to destroy socialist Islam   that (historically) moderate, compassionate and progressive religion. It smashed once secular Egypt; it overthrew the government in socialist Iran and then in near-Communist Indonesia, implanting in all these places horrifically degenerate and fully outdated religious concepts. It used extremists to destroy healthy patriotism and socialism. Like the Brits in the 19th Century ( You can control people s brains, while we will control your natural resources ), the West embraced Wahhabi teaching, because it was able to guarantee full obedience, dictatorial (pro-Western) governance and oppressive feudalism.Islam has been used and abused, manipulated and virtually stripped of its essence. The process has gone so far that two leading Iranian scholars, during my visit last-year to Tehran, declared to me:  In so many parts of the world, the West created an absolutely new religion. We don t recognize it, anymore. It has nothing to do with Islam. If the West in general and the United States in particular, left the Arab and Muslim world alone and in peace, we would most likely never see all those terrorist attacks, which are rocking the world from Indonesia to France Correct. Like a naughty, spoiled and heartless child, the West, after destroying the Soviet Union, painstakingly constructed its new enemy    militant Islam    so it could continue indulging in its favorite activity, which is perpetual conflict, endless wars and plunder.It is as simple as that.The greatest oppressors of the Muslim people, those in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Indonesia have all been closely allied to the West. The most terrible terrorist  Muslim  organizations, from Al-Qaida to ISIS, have been created, armed and supported by the West and its cronies.In Europe and in the United States, the  fear of terrorists  is fully exploited by the Western regime   a global class alliance of plutocrats, in actuality, with headquarters in Washington, where the main military and media muscle reside. It still clings to power mainly thanks to such fear implanted in the brains of  ordinary people .And what about the  War on Terror ? Yes, there really is such war, but the West is not the one who fights it. As this goes to print, the war against terrorism is being fought by Russia, Iran, China, Syria, Hezbollah and their allies!The West is still closely collaborating with the terrorists. It miraculously  avoids targeting them  when  fighting wars against them ; it financially supports some and trains others. It criticizes and antagonizes those who are actually fighting the extremist militant groups.Extremists have been unleashed, like Rottweiler fighting dogs, against almost all progressive governments in the Middle East, but also against China and Russia. Extremist Muslims, extremist Christians, even extremist Buddhists!In turn, the politicians in the United States are regularly supported, financially, by the regimes (including those of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, etc.) that are spreading, relentlessly, throughout the world, the most intolerant and grotesquely violent religious concepts.Despite their essential servility and cowardice, even some North American mainstream media outlets are now actively discussing various schemes involving the financing of the Clinton Foundation by Saudi Arabia (alongside several leading transnational corporations and Wall Street s largest banks).On its  Breaking News , as far back as in 2008, CNN reported:The donations to the William J. Clinton Foundation include amounts of $10 million to $25 million from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and real estate mogul Stephen Bing, a personal friend of the Clintons.The Clintons came under intense pressure during Hillary Clinton s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to release the names of donors to both the Foundation and to the Clinton presidential library in Arkansas.Bill Clinton agreed to the release of the list after President-elect Barack Obama nominated Hillary Clinton to become Secretary of State.The governments of Kuwait and Qatar are also on the list, as is Saudi businessman Nasser Al-Rashid, who has close ties to the Saudi royal family. Saudi Sheikh Mohammed H. Al-Amoudi, reputed to be one of the richest men in the world, is among the donors as well. Both Saudis contributed in the $1 million to $5 million range. A group called Friends of Saudi Arabia and the Dubai Foundation appear in the same category.  As recently as on August 20th, 2016, The New York Times wrote something similar, essentially reconfirming the validity of the earlier reports, while adding many more details and adjusting the figures: The kingdom of Saudi Arabia donated more than $10 million. Through a foundation, so did the son-in-law of a former Ukrainian president whose government was widely criticized for corruption and the murder of journalists. A Lebanese-Nigerian developer with vast business interests contributed as much as $5 million.For years the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation thrived largely on the generosity of foreign donors and individuals who gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the global charity. But now, as Mrs. Clinton seeks the White House, the funding of the sprawling philanthropy has become an Achilles  heel for her campaign and, if she is victorious, potentially her administration as well. Long time Clinton s top aide, Huma Abedin (who spent part of her childhood in Saudi Arabia) has been an intermediary between the former Secretary of State and pro-Saudi interests. She also negotiated financial support for Ms. Clinton from Mr. Chagouri and other individuals, organizations and businesses originating from the Middle East.The accusations and evidence keep coming in, from different media outlets, both left wing and right wing. On August 1st, 2016, the conservative Breitbart News stated: Khizr Khan, the Muslim Gold Star father that the mainstream media and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been using to criticize Donald J. Trump, has deep ties to the government of Saudi Arabia and to international Islamist investors through his own law firm. In addition to those ties to the wealthy Islamist nation, Khan also has ties to controversial immigration programs that wealthy foreigners can use to essentially buy their way into the United States and has deep ties to the  Clinton Cash  narrative through the Clinton Foundation.   Hillary s Saudi SponsorsHillary Clinton s dependence on Saudi sponsors has been strongly influencing her decision to maintain a foreign policy in the service of Riyadh and support for various terrorist groups controlled by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, in and beyond the Middle East region [including those currently active in Syria and Iraq].In reality, she is simply representing  continuity  of an already existing, deadly trend. The regime has been  evolving  for decades, but especially since the Ronald Reagan years. Republicans or Democrats: it truly matters very little. Both parties spread terror all over the world. True, George W. Bush invaded Iraq, but people like Bill Clinton are close friends and supporters of Paul Kagame, the Rwandese  butcher of Congo , with the blood of some 10 million people on his hands. Democrat and  moderate , Bill Clinton, was also responsible for the criminal bombing and destruction of socialist Yugoslavia. And so it goes But under Barack Obama s rule, the last hope for an independent Middle East and the Arab world has virtually evaporated. Libya has been destroyed; the Syrian civil war was launched from Washington, London and Paris. Saudis bathed rebellious Yemen in blood using UK and US produced weapons. Virtually all  Arab Spring revolutions  were infiltrated and diverted. And in Bahrain, the Shi a majority was literally raped by Saudi Arabia and its own ruthless rulers, with British advisors standing-by.The US and Europe have kept selling arms to the Gulf, building new military bases while supporting the most appalling and bloodthirsty regimes.The  Obama/ (Hilary) Clinton Era  has greatly  improved  the symbioses of Western imperialism, big business, and pro-Western fascist regimes worldwide, but particularly in the Middle East and Africa.This toxic embrace has proved fatal to millions of people in these two parts of the world. Hopes for self-governance have been ruined. Corpses keep piling up in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and elsewhere.The West does not care, as long as it stays in charge of the  show , and for as long as hundreds of billions of dollars are made by weapons  producers. Even if millions are dying, there is still an uninterrupted flow of raw materials to the West and Japan. Therefore, it is  business as usual .  Un-people  and their lives are worth nothing.At one point, Russia, Iran, China and others have said  enough is enough; let s fight against the true terrorists! Let s fight ISIS and other bigots! Let s give a hand to the independence-minded, socially-oriented patriots .Predictably,. this led to total outrage in Washington, London, and Paris (and Tokyo). Disobedience and rebellion against the global (Western) order could not be tolerated! It had to be crushed, even at the cost of new and deadly world war.NATO, Washington, Europe, Japan, and South Korea  all started a direct confrontation policy against Russia, China, Iran, North Korea (DPRK) and other members of the  Coalition of Daring . Brazil, an important member of BRICS, was recently destroyed by the extreme-right coup supported by the West.Even the Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump, in his rare moments of sanity, is clearly aware of the danger. He does not wish to confront Russia. He is obviously not willing to sacrifice tens of millions of human lives for some grotesque dreams of total world domination by a market fundamentalism backed by the white (or Western) supremacist dogmas.But Trump s moments of sanity are defined as  madness  by the mainstream propaganda. Not surprisingly! As was correctly stated by the great Indian thinker, Arundhati Roy, some several years ago:  now war is called peace and black is called white . Orwellian indeed, with a vengeance.The Clinton CampaignThe Clinton campaign has gone into overdrive. It attempts to distract attention from its own funding scandals, by accusing Donald Trump s aides of receiving financing from abroad. Trump is now described as  Russia s agent .This game   it is all self-serving: nothing to do with the interests of the world, or even the interests of the common  American people .For as long as the general political trend of the West does not radically change, or for as long as the West is not stopped by outside forces, perpetual wars will continue. Monstrous genocides in Africa, the destruction of entire states and regions in the Middle East, all this could easily spread to other parts of the Planet.It is clear now that if provoked and confronted, countries like China, Russia and Iran would not hesitate to fight back. They also may fight for others   for their tortured allies.The Western implants and their buddies, Mujahedeen/Al-Qaida, have already destroyed Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. ISIS, another mutant unleashed by the West and its allies, have been devastating Iraq, Syria, Libya and now what is left of Afghanistan.These  movements  have really nothing to do with Islam. They were manufactured in Washington, Riyadh, London, and Doha (and most likely even in Tel Aviv), for several concrete purposes, all of them thoroughly foul.They are making sure to ruin the socialist nature of Islam, insisting exclusively on the implementation of outdated, medieval fundamentalist interpretations.Huma Abedin s mother, Dr. Saleha Mahmood Abedin, is one of the founding members of the Muslim Sisterhood, and chairperson of the  International Islamic Committee for Woman and Child  (IICWC). She is also a well known writer and editor based in Saudi Arabia. Her organization (IICWC) had repeatedly argued that laws banning female circumcision should be revoked, as well as laws prohibiting child marriage and marital rape. During her visit to KSA, Hillary Clinton spoke at the Islamic college of Dar El-Hekma (where Dr. Saleha Abedin was a vice-dean) shoulder-to-shoulder with her favorite aide   Huma.Was this just an insignificant episode? Like those millions of dollars in Saudi Arabian funding for Clinton s foundation? Like the US  foreign policy  in the Gulf and in the Middle East, like spreading Muslim extremist groups to all corners of the world, from Africa, the Middle East, to Southeast Asia and even China? Like unleashing conservative Islam against socialist Muslim countries?Too many  episodes ! Too much blood  It is time to say what is by now obvious:  The US establishment is not fighting  Muslim terrorism  or even  extremism ; it is manufacturing it, and injecting it everywhere. The only real enemy that Washington, London and Paris have, for decades, even for centuries, is the anti-colonialist struggle, and the burning desire of people, worldwide, to terminate the West s global dictatorship.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Written by Philip Giraldi Tuesday November 1, 2016 In between nearly daily campaign stops shilling for Hillary, President Barack Obama has been promoting his record as Head of State. To Obama’s credit, he talks nice and appears to be both thoughtful and rational, qualities that were not always evident in his predecessor in office. But the hype about what was achieved in his eight years appears to be more than a bit overblown, particularly if one considers the flagship domestic project, Obamacare. It is a program in which the government forces individuals to buy a product that has been crafted together by private, for profit companies. If the people do not buy, they will be penalized by the government. The companies in turn have learned that it is tough to make money insuring people who are actually sick so they are leaving the program while those individuals who have to buy their own coverage without government subsidies are discovering that the significant annual price increases mean that they cannot afford insurance at all. Donald Trump is right that the program is in crisis, is “over,” and should be repealed. Against that, what has Obama accomplished domestically? I will not consider the constant pandering on gender and race because that is, after all, what Democrats do. But if one considers immigration a part of domestic policy, he is responsible for refusing to enforce immigration law, letting Haitians stay illegally in the US as compensation for a hurricane that occurred in 2010, while also failing to deport whole categories of Hispanics who are in the country without visas or residency permits. Domestic would also include the continuation of several types of surveillance of citizens by the NSA and FBI, the hounding and prosecution of whistleblowers, and the increased reliance on the State Secrets privilege to derail the use of the judicial system to pushback against government overreach. And in a just concluded parole hearing involving a Guantanamo detainee who had been repeatedly tortured, the Obama Administration has now determined that some individuals can be held in prison forever without ever being charged with a crime or convicted. But it is in the foreign and national security policy areas that Obama has been most visibly active as he has a relatively free hand based on what he considers to be his own “unitary executive” authority. In his famous Cairo speech delivered to the Muslim world in 2009 he promised change but basically did not deliver, though there have actually been several successes in foreign policy that date to the past year. He should get full credit for confronting the Israel Lobby and Congress (essentially the same thing) to obtain a nuclear program agreement with Iran. Likewise, he went against the Cuban Lobby and GOP in Congress (also essentially the same thing) to ease relations with Havana. He still might do the right thing by the Palestinians and allow the US to recognize their statehood at the United Nations later this month or even support the French plan for a multinational conference to create a Palestinian state but I wouldn’t want to bet on it, particularly as the incoming Administration headed by Hillary Clinton will be firmly in the Israeli pocket and Obama would presumably defer to her before doing anything dramatic. And Obama should also get credit for some things that he didn’t do. He did not exacerbate tensions with Russia by arming Ukraine with game changing offensive weapons in spite of intense pressure from Congress and the media and he did not get involved in a new land war involving tens of thousands of American soldiers in Asia even though some of his advisers were urging him to do so in Syria. But by the same measure starting yet another war by proxy, in Libya, was a complete failure, though it did not involve American boots on the ground. It was a war that might in part be attributed to the aggressive advocacy of Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State at the time. And while it should also be recalled to Obama’s credit that he made no effort to maintain a troop presence in Iraq, he was unable to extricate US forces from America’s longest war in Afghanistan, which continues and is likely to be on the presidential agenda for the next decade or even longer. Nor could he dissuade the Saudis from initiating their brutal and senseless war on Yemen, which has had devastating consequences with more to come for the entire region. And President Obama has also failed to closed Guantanamo prison in spite of promises made eight years ago to do so. President Obama has also changed the actual mechanics of America’s intervention in the world, using drones and aerial bombardment instead of soldiers on the ground to enforce Washington’s diktat. A Pentagon press release in September boasted how over Labor Day weekend US warplanes attacked targets in six countries. The United States was not at war with any of them. And then there is Anwar al-Awlaki and his son, American citizens who were executed in Yemen by drone without any legal process, by executive order, after they were placed on a “kill list” compiled by the White House. But Obama’s poorest grades relate to his handling of Russia, Syria and Israel, all three of which might plausibly be seen as linked issues as Secretary Clinton once commented that Syria’s government would have to be brought down to benefit Israel while Russia is Syria’s most important ally. The problem with Syria is the policy itself. The only serious direct threat emanating from the country is ISIS, which has the capability to send suicide bombers and other dedicated terrorists to strike targets in the United States and Europe. To be sure, Washington is operating against ISIS, providing intelligence, equipment and training to its proxies and the “moderate” rebels that it supports in the country, but the effort is a mish mash, involving as it does feckless allies and clashing loyalties. The Pentagon and CIA have meanwhile been training batches of dubious recruits, some of whom turn their weapons over to the crazies at first opportunity. The Defense Department deflected completely accurate charges that it was supporting terrorists by changing the names of the groups involved. Amid the chaos, President Obama has even conceded that there are no moderate rebels. Defeating ISIS would be relatively simple if everyone were on the same page, but the White House persists in seeing the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad as the top priority, as if creating a power vacuum in Damascus would be a solution to what ISIS has been doing. And pressuring al-Assad also creates and feeds the ongoing problems with Russia. As the beltway groupthink goes, Syria minus al-Assad and Vladimir Putin would magically become a place where all the moderate, nation-building and democratically inclined forces would be able to come together and form a new government that would immeasurably benefit the Syrian people. That formulation is, of course, complete nonsense and it is Moscow that has a clear understanding of what is at stake, not Washington. The reality is that creating a power vacuum is precisely what provides the opportunity for militant groups to settle in and expand their authority. It is how al-Qaeda and ISIS both came into prominence. It happens because, as in Iraq and Libya, the Washington interventionists have no idea what might succeed as a post-civil war political system in Syria. Nor do they have any real plan for achieving a functioning polity. US administrations have already tried decapitation of existing leadership in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya with catastrophic results but one of the delights of the American political system is that all the key policy players change every four to eight years meaning that lessons learned are lost and have to be discovered a second time around, repeating as necessary. That regime change would work any better in Syria defies belief but it is nevertheless what Washington chooses to believe and by seeing al-Assad as an enemy it is hampering the effort against ISIS’s most effective asset: the Syrian Army backed up by Russian air support. And then there is Israel. Israel is, according to many Congressmen and the media, America’s best friend and greatest ally. It is a judgment that also defies belief as Tel Aviv and more particularly its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been persistently pursuing policies that are nominally opposed by the United States government, most particularly the expansion of its settlements. It has also interfered in US internal politics during elections and did not hesitate to exploit political divisions in Congress when Netanyahu was invited by GOP leaders to speak to a joint session to provide his perception of President Obama’s “misguided” negotiations with Iran. Israel is no friend of the United States even if it does receive an annual handout currently running at in excess of $3 billion and unlimited political cover in international bodies. Obama reportedly hates Netanyahu but did not have the courage to do anything about him. So the Obama record is a mixed bag, but mostly a disappointment. His presidency will be somewhat untouchable by those who do retrospectives, as least for a while, protected by Obama’s status as America’s first black president. It would have been nice to see real health care reform, a backing off from police state norms in the war on terror, and less lethal engagement in other people’s quarrels overseas, but I suppose Obama would argue that GOP obstruction and the Establishment consensus caused him to support policies and engage in compromises that he really wanted to avoid. There may be some truth to that but ultimately Obama comes across as yet another morally deficient head of state who presumably saw the folly in the status quo but ultimately decided that loyalty to his party and dedication to its continuation in power was more important than doing what was right. Ultimately, the acquisition of money and power are everything in our system of government and the brief trajectory of Barack Hussein Obama is no exception to that rule.

Calling Hillary Clinton a  bigot  has reporters asking every Republican in sight if Donald Trump has gone too far. But the Clinton campaign releases a video saying Mr. Trump is the candidate of the Ku Klux Klan, and it s all okey-dokey?Then again, Mr. Trump has already been likened to Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Small wonder there s a collective ho-hum when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says Mr. Trump is peddling  KKK values. This is what Democrats do. It didn t start with Mr. Trump, either. For years Democrats have portrayed the GOP as one giant hate group.Each presidential election, the drill goes like this: After Republicans nominate someone, he immediately finds himself having to prove he s not a hater   of African-Americans, of women, of gays, etc.This year Democrats added a twist. Mr. Trump, they claim, represents a break with all those decent and lovable Republicans such as Mitt Romney, John McCain and George W. Bush. Of course, this isn t what they were saying back when these men were running for president.  In 2000, for example, an NAACP ad recreated the gruesome murder of James Byrd to imply that then-Gov. Bush was sympathetic to lynching black men. Over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck, Mr. Byrd s daughter says,  So when Gov. George W. Bush refused to support hate-crimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.  When John McCain ran in 2008, Barack Obama warned that Republicans would scare people by saying,  You know, he doesn t look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.  The McCain campaign fired back, accusing Mr. Obama of playing the race card from the  bottom of the deck.  Funny thing: All those reporters always hearing  dog whistles  from Republicans somehow didn t hear this one.  In 2012, when Mitt Romney went to the NAACP and told them face-to-face about his opposition to ObamaCare, the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote.

When a lawsuit brought against these manufacturers was found to be frivolous, Clinton made a big fuss about it on Twitter: It's incomprehensible that our laws would protect gun makers over Sandy Hook families. We need to fix this. https://t.co/96uBe92wPi \n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 15, 2016 \nIn September 1993 during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Hillary Clinton was asked by Senator Bill Bradley if she supported a 25% sales tax on handguns and automatic weapons. She was very clear in her support of taxing guns: \n“I’m all for that. I just don’t know what else we’re going to do to try to figure out how to get some handle on this violence,” said Clinton. “I’m speaking personally, but I feel very strongly about that.” \nIn another email exchange dated January 14, 2016, Clinton wrote about using racial division to further her gun control agenda by selectively ignoring occurrences of gun violence that were not racially motivated. For this reason, according to the email, the Clinton campaign did not include the story of Jordan Davis in an essay on gun violence: \nThis is great. My edits are attached. The only flag here is that Jordan Davis was killed by a white man, so arguably – this crime was racially motivated, which takes this outside the discussion of gun violence. Was there another mother in the Chicago meeting where the shooting was NOT racially motivated? If yes, we should use that story instead of Jordan Davis. \nIn another email from March 17, we see an exchange about how to attack Donald Trump and a press call with Arizona locals about gun control.

Greenwood apologized for using  abhorrent language  during the dispute, but his attorney has maintained that Greenwood was  in no way involved in any physical altercation of any kind,  according to The Cornell Daily Sun.Black Students United want more to be done, and they re using the unfortunate incident to pressure school officials into a list of 12 demands   at least some of which target other black students.The demands are prefaced with a diatribe on Cornell s inherently white supremacist system that allegedly perpetuates a daily assault of racism against black students on campus. We attend a university that s obsessed with the optics of our black and brown faces but is indifferent to the justice we week. This is not an indictment of white people; this is an indictment of a system that perpetuates white supremacy and shelters our peers under the warm blanket of white privilege   all the while, we are left to freeze in our frigid reality of racist epithets, essentialist curriculum, and apathetic governance,  the letter read. In post-racial America, our classmates call us niggers from their pickup trucks in broad daylight. In post-racial America, we are berated by airborne bottles on our own campus. In post-racial America, we are told we have a chip on our shoulder. We are called everything but our name. Above all else, in post-racial America we are bombarded by the deafening silence that allows the centuries-old hum of white supremacy to grow louder,  it continued.  Silence is violence. Because Cornell is racist, and its Interfraternity Council is an alleged arm of the white supremacist system, Black Students United drew up a list of 12 demands that will help set things right.They include a system of mandatory coursework for all students that s focused on race, gender, discrimination, white privilege and other social justice causes from the perspective of  oppressed people,  as well as mandatory training for staff on the same issues.Black Students United want Psi Upsilon shut down and to use the building as  an adequate and appropriate space for the people of the Africa diaspora to utilize for programs of any kind, in perpetuity. The group also demands mandatory diversity and inclusion training for all greek members on campus, a special  minority liaison  position on the University Assembly, Cornell Health to hire at least two black psychologists and one black doctor in coming years, a new student-led dispute resolution process, and a limit on different types of black students admitted to the Ivy League school. We demand that Cornell Admissions to come up with a plan to actively increase the presence of underrepresented Black students on this campus. We define underrepresented Black students as Black Americans who have several generations (more than two) in this country,  the letter read.The problem is there are too many black students from other places outside of the U.S., Black Students United argued. The Black student population at Cornell disproportionately represents international or first-generation African or Caribbean students,  BSU wrote.  While these students have a right to flourish at Cornell, there is a lack of investment in Black students whose families were affected directly by the African Holocaust in America. Cornell must work to actively support students whose families have been impacted for generations by white supremacy and American fascism.

Illegal alien prisoners are being released at an unprecedented rate. Our borders are being left wide open by a President who s demanded our US Border Agents stand down. Visas are being given to people coming here with the sole intention of harming innocent Americans. Law enforcement has been ridiculed and weakened by a spiteful racist and his willing accomplices in the media. What do we need to do to alert the Kim Kardashian followers our United States of America  is intentionally being destroyed by a radical in the White House?National Security: The Pentagon has cleared the release of 17 more terrorist detainees from Guantanamo Bay prison. President Obama puts jihadist boots on the ground before mobilizing U.S. troops in the Middle East.A congressional aide told Fox News on Thursday that the White House s strategy in the decision this week to set free more terrorist prisoners from the Gitmo facility in U.S.-controlled territory in Cuba is to get the number of detainees there to  as low as they can get,  even if it means  a good deal of risk.  The underlying reason is that closing Gitmo was a major Obama campaign promise in 2008, and he doesn t want to leave office with it still open.But the promise was to close it in 2009. Upon taking office, however, Obama found himself faced with the fact that Gitmo was a rather brilliant idea that the Bush administration came up with to prevent captured terrorists from exploiting the U.S. legal system.The spectacle of U.S. courts setting terrorists free, after trials in which the jihadists  American legal teams might actually get access to and make public sensitive classified information, was not anything for which Obama wanted to be blamed. He seems amenable, however, to his successor having nowhere to hold captured terrorists.Release of the 17 supposedly  low-level  combatants, many of them from Yemen, where war rages, brings the number of Gitmo prisoners down to 90. We were told that  Osama bin Laden s cook,  Ibrahim al-Qosi, released by Obama from Gitmo in 2012, was low-level, but now he cooks up terrorist operations as a celebrity leader of al-Qaida in Yemen.The Pentagon is going along with this politicized emptying of the Guantanamo Bay holding facility. And the decision coming right after an Islamic State-inspired Christmas party attack within the homeland, which slaughtered 14 innocent Americans, suggests the U.S. military leadership has become a group of puppets.A major reason for former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel s forced departure as Obama s defense secretary last year after a brief tenure, let s not forget, was his hesitation in approving Gitmo releases.In last week s GOP presidential debate, it was a woman who promised that she would  immediately  reverse Obama s emasculation of the Pentagon. Carly Fiorina pledged to  bring back the warrior class   Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn   every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn t want to hear. Obama calls Gitmo  a sad chapter in American history,  but it was almost comic when the worst complaint Shaker Aamer, released from Gitmo in October after nearly 14 years, could tell of in a British TV interview was  they just suck all your feelings out of you,  adding that  torture is not about beating. Torture is not about hanging from the ceiling with handcuffs and all that     all that  presumably being three square halal meals a day, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer.Curiously,  The Most Transparent Administration in History  is now imposing new, severe restrictions on journalist access to Guantanamo Bay, with no more visits to the two detention centers where most detainees are housed, and no more interviews of guards and staff. Outgoing U.S. Southern Command chief Marine Gen. John Kelly told AP that the reason was:  We really did have to get some organization to what was going on down there.  After all these years?Under Obama, information on the frequency of prisoners assaulting guards and conducting hunger strikes has stopped being made public.It isn t torture or mistreatment that the Obama administration is hiding from the world s eyes within the walls of Guantanamo Bay; it s that what we have down there is a luxury resort to house terrorists, and that the president is incrementally releasing those soldiers of jihad back onto the battlefield   after America has spent years fattening them up.

I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? The plot thickens in this case. Will we finally find the murderer of this young man and who is behind it?IN CASE YOU HAVEN T SEEN UPDATES ON THIS CASE:CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL: SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist, Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founder DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To  Stand Down  On Case [VIDEO]Wow! The private investigator hired by the Rich family to look into the death of 27-year old murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich just revealed some stunning evidence. It s been confirmed that over 44,000 emails and over 17,000 attachments were sent to the now deceased investigative journalist and best friend of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Now that this new information has been made available to the public, will the media be asking Hillary or the DNC any questions about their involvement in Rich s death? Will the DOJ be opening an investigation into his death in light of this new stunning evidence? What about the alleged Russian hack of the DNC emails that the media tried to tie to President Trump?Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election:Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange (and his closest friend in London), to WikiLeaks' Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell and many others.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed. My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  Wheeler said.  I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.   FOX NewsWe reported on this story extensively. Here are some of our stunning findings over the past 10 months. It s pretty stunning that it took so long to find out about the e-mails on Rich s laptop: Conspiracy theories have been surrounding the murder of Seth Rich. They reached a new frenzy after the hacking of DNC e-mails led to the resignation of its chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Rich was beaten, shot and killed early on the morning of July 8 while he was walking home and talking on the phone to his girlfriend. Police have said they haven t determined if his murder was a botched robbery or something else. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone.Wikileaks just confirmed murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leak.Wikileaks released a series direct messages from US alleged  Russian spy  Guccifer 2.0 to actress model Robbin Young (according to Young).In the stream of texts the discussion leads to the DNC leaker.His name is  Seth ** In November Julian Assange said Russia did not hack into the DNC servers. -h/t GP Here s the proof:Direct Messages from U.S. alleged Russian spy @GUCCIFER_2 to actress-model @robbin_young (according to the latter) https://t.co/uMsB9WgxRQ  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 8, 2017Actress Robbin Young claims she had given this information she received from Guccifer 2.0 to the authorities but,  no one cared :https://twitter.com/Robbin_Young/status/850743524953702404Actress Robbin Young states that Guccifer 2.0 told her,  i m eager to find facts about seth, i m sure it wasn t just a robbery. seth was assassinated. :Guccifer 2.0 said, \"i'm eager to find fact about seth, i'm sure it wasn't just a robbery. seth was assassinated.\" #SethRich  Robbin Young (@Robbin_Young) March 29, 2017In June 2016,the hacker Guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for breaking into the Democratic National Committee s servers, lifting opposition research the DNC had gathered, including a 200-page document focused on presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The hacker s moniker is an homage to  Guccifer,  the nom de guerre of Romanian hacker Marcel Lazar who claimed a previous hack into Hillary Clinton s private email server and is now awaiting prosecution for cybercrimes.  RTWhile Wikileaks  Julian Assange was being interviewed by John Pilger, he brought up the death of Seth Rich. Watch Assange s strange and somewhat cagey reply.Here is part of the conversation:Julian Assange: Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks. As a 27 year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.Reporter: That was just a robbery, I believe. Wasn t it?Julian Assange: No. There s no finding. So  I m suggesting that our sources take risks.Watch it again in slow motion below:Seth Rich s parents explain what happened only moments before his death. He was the Voter Expansion Data Director for the DNC. His parents say he was,  Making sure everyone who wanted to vote, had the opportunity :Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a  lead  saying that Rich was en route to the FBI that fateful morning, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an  ongoing court case  possibly involving the Clinton family.More recently, Wikileaks s thousands of DNC emails and voice mails have piqued Reddit s interest, with Redditors combing through years of communications looking for any clue to Rich s murder.The theory is apparently based on Julian Assange s recent ITV appearance, where he scoffed at the idea that Russian hackers could be responsible for the data dump, and said that  anyone  within the Democrats  organization could easily have sent Wikileaks the offending messages.Given that Rich as a DNC staffer presumably would have had some access to its servers, Reddit is absolutely positive Rich paid the ultimate price for exposing Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC s crusade against Bernie Sanders.

Where are the Catholics who re against this scam? The Catholic church has been hijacked by leftists who re following the one world global agenda in the name of social justice: Fossil fuel is the cheapest form of energy man has these days, and these people have the audacity to talk about  the cry of the poor  while advocating for things that will make it far more difficult for them to exist and survive?????  The only thing that makes life unfair is the delusion that it should be fair.    Steve Maraboli Does this political agenda mean the church is now giving up its tax exempt status? You can t have it both ways. Please speak up against this! The ten-point plan advanced by the bishops calls for the adoption of  a fair, transformational and legally binding global agreement based on our vision of the world.  In the lead-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris next month, a group of cardinals, patriarchs and bishops have called for a radical, legally binding international climate agreement that mandates, among other things, complete global decarbonization by 2050 and  an end to the fossil fuel era.  The nine prelates claim to represent  the Catholic Church from the five continents  and will address participants in the COP 21 in Paris taking place from November 30 to December 11, 2015. Signers include Archbishop Joseph Kurtz, the president of the U.S. Bishops Conference, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, president of the union of European Bishops Conferences (COMECE) and Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Bombay. Drawing inspiration from Pope Francis  encyclical letter on the environment Laudato S , the bishops express the  widely-held hope that a just and legally binding climate agreement will emerge from the negotiations of the COP 21 in Paris,  and to this end, advance  a ten-point policy proposal.  In their appeal, the bishops reference the  dramatic acceleration of climatic change,  which, they say,  is the result of unrestrained human activity.  They also claim that this ecological phenomenon is primarily due to  excessive reliance on fossil fuels.   The Pope and Catholic Bishops from five continents,  the declaration states,  appeal for a drastic reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases.  Human-induced climate change, the bishops continue, is having a  dramatic impact  on  sea levels, extreme weather events, deteriorating ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity.

That means that all personal liberties could fly right out the window, except for one: the liberty to discriminate based on who people love. Trump and the new Congress haven t even taken office yet and the legislative hatred has already begun.Ted Cruz, who s never met a gay person or a woman who didn t make him feel self-righteous, is expected to reintroduce the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA), which, despite its completely inoffensive name, is all about allowing bigots to freely discriminate. Trump is expected to sign it.In the text, the bill says that businesses can refuse service based on one of two beliefs, and both are ridiculous: that marriage  is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman  or  sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage. As for the second one, well, unless a couple is entering an establishment demanding space to specifically have sex, it doesn t seem there s ever a reason to declare that one. As for the first, marriage is what the law says it is, and the law says that marriage is between two consenting adults who get married. Okay, that s not the legal definition, but the Supreme Court, when Antonin Scalia was still alive, said that defining marriage is unconstitutional.The CEO of Equality Texas agrees that the proposed law shouldn t be a law at all. The legislation that Senator Cruz is proposing specifically elevates two narrow interpretations above any other religious practice,  Chuck Smith, CEO of Equality Texas said.  The bill is titled the First Amendment Defense Act, but in reality it is an unconstitutional attempt to totally redefine what the first amendment protects. Source: KXANIt would also put the Federal Government in the weird position of suing itself. The FADA would allow businesses to sue if the government wouldn t let them discriminate. The U.S. Attorney General would be required to defend the businesses against the government.Trump will likely sign the bill, at least according to his campaign s website: If I am elected president and Congress passes the First Amendment Defense Act, I will sign it to protect the deeply held religious beliefs of Catholics and the beliefs of Americans of all faiths.

I was neither shocked nor dismayed by Mrs. Clinton s speech (but I did graduate from Wellesley   with honors!) It was exactly the kind of self-pitying, leaden and all-about-me performance that I would have expected from the entitled former Democrat candidate and now sore loser.Watch a few of Hillary s greatest hits during her commencement speech at Wellesley College:Also, it revealed this: Hillary hasn t learned a thing. As her friend Mike Bloomberg recently told an audience of Harvard Business School grads   Hillary lost the election because she had absolutely no message. She still doesn t.In addition, she is utterly lacking in self-awareness. She spoke at length about what she sees as a  full-fledged assault on truth and reason,  telling the graduating seniors that  the future of America, indeed the future of the world, depends on brave, thoughtful people like you insisting on truth and integrity right now every day.  This, from a woman who ran for our nation s highest office while distrusted by nearly two-thirds of the country, with good reason.As long as Mrs. Clinton and her loyalists blame James Comey, Vladimir Putin, sexism and the alt-right for her loss, Democrats will never rebuild their bridges to the working class Americans who elected Donald Trump.In her remarks, Hillary criticized  people    aka Trump followers, presumably   on social media for  sowing division at a time when we desperately need unity,  and then proceeded to give a highly partisan and divisive speech.Did she ever consider that there might be families in the audience who voted for her opponent? That they might not enjoy her taking veiled potshots at President Trump, and that this was their daughters  day too?Echoing the liberal media, Hillary went after President Trump through innuendo and clich s, talking about the dangers of fomenting fear and of  alternative facts.  Good thing there was no Q&A; someone might have wanted further clarification of how she came under sniper fire in Bosnia, or how a video caused the Benghazi attack or how the Monica Lewinsky scandal stemmed from a  vast right-wing conspiracy  and not Bill Clinton s unruly libido.Hillary trod dangerous pathways as she remarked,  when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society.  She is correct, of course, but a cursory review of her multiple dodges and lies about her mishandling of classified information and efforts to destroy evidence reveals a woman who fully earned her low trustworthiness ratings from Americans.The election is over, but Hillary cannot let it go. This is good news for Republicans. As long as Mrs. Clinton and her loyalists blame James Comey, Vladimir Putin, sexism and the alt-right for her loss, Democrats will never rebuild their bridges to the working class Americans who elected Donald Trump.Hillary Clinton missed an opportunity at Wellesley. She could have delivered a message of unity, and helped our anxious country begin to heal. Her followers need to see her putting country above politics; they need to see her as she briefly appeared at the inauguration, supporting the peaceful and legitimate transfer of power. Apparently, that is just too heavy a lift for Mrs. Clinton. She is happier nursing her wounds, and continuing to inflict them on the country.The former First Lady could also have talked about the dramatic changes taking place in our economy, and how women are thriving as entrepreneurs. She could have talked about the founders of Rent the Runway, or Sarah Blakely, who created Spanx, or Essie Weingarten, who bet her life s savings on a new idea and created a nail polish empire sold to L Oreal in 2010. These women are inspirational; they didn t shatter glass ceilings, they ignored them. It is true we need women in politics, and running NGOs, but we also need women making money and boosting the economy. That s where the funding for free college tuition and refugee services comes from   a lesson Hillary may never have learned.The New York Times tells us that the students cheered Mrs. Clinton  thunderously.  Of course they did. They have been weaned on courses like  Love and Intimacy  in the Women s and Gender Studies department or  Changing Gender Constructions in the Modern Middle East  in the History Department. There s nothing wrong with those studies, unless they crowd out learning how the progressive policies of Bernie Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have failed in France, for instance, leading to a stagnant economy with few opportunities for progress. Or how capitalism has delivered billions from poverty, including in Communist China, where the growth miracle of recent decades was facilitated by policies that encouraged entrepreneurship and private enterprise.Hillary Clinton missed some history lessons too, apparently. She alluded to Nixon s presidency which  would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice.  That isn t true, of course; Nixon resigned from office. It was her husband Bill who was impeached. Amazing she would get that wrong, in delivering what was sure to be a much-reviewed address. Maybe a little too much of that Chardonnay, Mrs. Clinton?

Things are apparently so good for the former first lady that ABC has her with a 12-point lead, a margin not seen in a presidential election since 1984. CNN is less confident but still has her sporting a comfortable 5-point lead. Fox News has wavered between “too close to call” and the current 3-point edge that is contingent on her achieving President Obama’s D+7 support level from 2008, which borders on complete insanity. \nThe purpose of this article is to prove that the media is either lying to massively impact motivation or turnout for Trump or has absolutely no idea what the actual score is. The media don’t care if I know what they are doing with their nonstop analysis of new “chaos” within the Trump campaign. They are playing this sad song for the record number of independent voters who appear to be requesting ballots or voting early in battlegrounds across America. \nThe first clue is that in the same week, ABC and CNN have polls showing a massive lead and a comfortable lead, respectively. These two polls are seven points apart. Obama’s landslide win from 2008 was by a margin of 7.6%, and he still lost 22 states. Still, the enthusiasm and novelty of his campaign, combined with the natural pendulum swing that takes place after eight years of either party in the White House, left little doubt that he would win easily. Currently, ABC and CNN have the distance of Obama’s landslide margin between their polls. \nFor those keeping score at home, here is how these polls play out on a map: \n5 points \nObama won re-election in 2012 by 3.9%. The tightest red state was North Carolina, which Mitt Romney carried by 2.0%. In the event of a five-point Clinton win, I suspect that North Carolina would be the only possible state to flip, but it wouldn’t surprise me for the map to stay identical to 2012. In this scenario, as in 2012, Hillary is not competitive in Arizona, Georgia, or Texas, as the media indicates today. \n12 points \nThis map should show you that the media aren’t even trying to be objective anymore. The blue nightmare above sees the GOP holding a likely minimum of six states, and no more than 11. At a twelve-point margin, there are no swing states. None. Not even second-tier swing states like Missouri, Arizona, or Georgia. For the first time since 1996, the Democrats would have made inroads into the Deep South and would threaten some of the reddest states. \nWhy is this important? The media are deliberately misleading the electorate and can’t even keep their own lies between the networks laced with a scent of historical accuracy. Recent state polls from battlegrounds like Ohio, Florida , North Carolina, Nevada, and others, combined with what we already know about levels of minority support, absentee balloting, early voting turnout, and enthusiasm, indicate that Trump is ahead or neck and neck in the Electoral College. Regardless of the final outcome, competition in these states cannot possibly correlate with a 12-point loss. Companies that release polling like this deserve all the ridicule they will receive for compromising their integrity.", "output": "0. Fake"}

Before Wikipedia administrators put a temporary lock on the entry early Monday morning, the top Google result for the term was a link to the Wiki article displaying Clinton’s photo, along with the following quote defining pathological lying:\n\n“It is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders. Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental disorders.” \nThe revision history of the entry shows the picture of Clinton was originally added to the ‘pathological lying’ Wikipedia article on the morning of October 29th, but it wasn’t until the next night that the ever-vigilant internet community took notice and excitedly spread the word on Facebook and Twitter . Check out the Google Trends report for ‘pathological lying’ below:\n\nUnsurprisingly, most reactions were supportive of the alteration to the Wikipedia article, once again showing the public’s general distrust of the presidential candidate. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University last year asked voters to say the first thing that came to mind when they thought of Hillary Clinton. The most popular response was “liar,” followed by “dishonest” and “untrustworthy.” Maybe if the biggest names in journalism weren’t outright colluding with Hillary’s campaign , that poll would have been more widely reported. Maybe.\nDue to the fact major media corporations are completely ignoring the corruption surrounding the Clinton campaign, it has been left to Wikileaks, independent media outlets, and the social media community to push this information into the public eye. Just a week away from the election, new evidence was discovered that prompted the FBI to announce they have reopened the criminal investigation into Hillary’s private email server.\nWith Republican nominee Donald Trump scheduled to appear in court to face rape allegations, there is a high possibility the next president of the United States will be facing criminal charges before they’re even inaugurated. If nothing else, this election cycle is proving that people want truth — and they’ll get creative to expose it.\nCourtesy post via Josie Wales and theAntiMedia.org.", "output": "0. Fake"}

Today’s demonstration of its awesomeness is an Op-Ed in The Nation by former Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) entitled Why Is the Foreign Policy Establishment Spoiling for More War? Look at Their Donors . He is “fed up with the DC policy elite who cash in on war while presenting themselves as experts, at the cost of other people’s lives, our national fortune, and the sacred honor of our country.” \nIt’s kind of adorable that Kucinich thinks our country has some sort of “sacred honor” going for it. Nevertheless, I have always liked this d00d. \nKucinich brought Articles of Impeachment against Dick Cheney and George W. Bush for high crimes and misdemeanors in connection with the Iraq war. His efforts went precisely nowhere (“impeachment is not on our agenda.” -Nancy Pelosi). When he ran for president in 2008, Kucinich’s platform included : single-payer universal health care; bans on offshore drilling, toxic pesticides and privatizing Social Security; legalizing pot and ending the War on Drugs; and—my personal favorite—creating a cabinet-level “ Department of Peace ” to foster international cooperation. That last one naturally made him the laughingstock of the beltway press, punditocracy and Congress. There’s no money in peace FFS! Well, not for the right people anyway. NO ONE WANTS THAT. When Kucinich ran for a newly redistricted House seat in 2012, he was defeated in the Democratic primary by Marcy Kaptur (D- Forced Birth Brigades ). \nIn the Op-ed Kucinich goes after DC’s so-called “think tanks,” and the Brookings Institute in particular. He notes that Brookings, “ in a report to Congress , admitted it received $250,000 from the US Central Command, Centcom…Pentagon money to think tanks that endorse war?” And the Generals’ preferred war policies isn’t the only thing Brookings is shilling for: as Kucinich notes, the Food and Drug Administration, the US Department of transportation and the US Department of Health and Human Services all give money—taxpayer money—to Brookings, which in turn promotes these agencies’ preferred policies to Congress and the press with the sheen of academic gravitas and objectivity. \nKuchinich says: \n“It is our patriotic duty to expose why the DC foreign-policy establishment and its sponsors have not learned from their failures and instead are repeating them, with the acquiescence of the political class and sleepwalkers with press passes.” \nWhy? Because from their perspective these are not failures—not at all. See, what informed, rational citizens who value the security and wellbeing of humanity here and around the globe might call “fucking epic foreign policy disasters,” are instead for the bipartisan DC establishment wicked smart, wildly successful, solid business decisions. \nDennis Kucinich knows this of course; the point of his article is to shed some light on the real winners of our wars, and some of the dynamics at work that virtually ensure their continued victory. He’s just connecting the dots into a picture that anyone can see if we cared to look. Generally speaking, we don’t. It’s an ugly picture. \nI think I’ll just close with the hallowed words of preeminent 20th century philosopher Boy George : \nWar is stupid, and people are stupid And love means nothing in some strange quarters. \nHave a nice day.

The suit cited wrongful termination, unpaid overtime wages, racial discrimination and sexual harassment for identifying as gay. The case was dismissed due to lack of evidence, although it s unclear whether a settlement was reached.According to an internal memo included in the court documents, after Flanagan was presented with a severance letter in February 2013, he said,  You better call police because I m going to make a big stink.  A newsroom employee called 911, and police officers arrived to physically escort Flanagan from the building.Memos indicate that Ward videotaped Flanagan as he was escorted out. Flanagan told Ward to  lose your big gut,  and flipped off the camera.WDBJ objected to Flanagan s request for employee documents, claiming the personnel records were proprietary information and irrelevant to his claims.The court filings also include Flanagan s application for employment at WDBJ and his resume, in which he reported graduating from San Francisco State University with a 3.7 grade point average and his affiliation with the National Association of Black Journalists.Flanagan was offered a position with WDBJ on March 6, 2012, as a multimedia journalist/general assignment reporter with an annual salary of $36,000. However, he quickly racked up a misconduct record during his year of employment.In a performance review in August 2012, Flanagan was given a  1,  the lowest rating, for being  respectful to coworkers at all times,  but a  4  for work diligence and attendance. He was written up in November 2012 for wearing a Barack Obama sticker.By the end of that year, his supervisor was expressing dissatisfaction with the quality of Flanagan s work, as well as his attitude towards his co-workers.

He s ruthless, he s extreme right, he s abusive, and he s just flat terrifying. Prisoners have died under his watch, too, for reasons such as labor and thirst. When the Milwaukee County medical examiner released standard reports on two of these deaths, Clarke absolutely lost it.Brian Peterson told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that Clarke called him at the end of October and  verbally pummeled him  because of those reports. He threatened to contact the state s medical licensing board to have Peterson s license revoked, or at least to get him sanctioned.

Someone who s going to threaten to destroy those who expose the truth about him? It s actually no wonder Trump would consider him   that s what Trump does.

This isn t an isolated incident.Clarke has excoriated Black Lives Matter as an anarchist group and a hate group, and predicted that they d join forces with ISIS at some point to destroy America. He s also a member of an extreme anti-government group known as the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Organization, which should make him unfit to serve as Secretary of anything at all.That organization promotes the idea that  the county sheriff is the supreme law enforcement  entity in the country, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.Clarke s office contacted the county executive s office to claim that they had a recording of the entire conversation and paint Peterson as a liar.

The only thing that was wrong with her statement is that she left out a key prejudice among Trump supporters   anti-Semitism.It s no secret anymore that with the rise of Donald Trump the United States has seen a rise in anti-Semitic rhetoric, particularly aimed at those in the media who write unflattering (yet unbiased) articles about Trump.According to CNN:The ADL [Anti-Defamation League] says it found 2.6 million tweets  containing language frequently found in anti-Semitic speech  between August 2015 and July 2016. 19,253 of those tweets were directed at American journalists, the ADL found; the top 10 most targeted journalists (all of whom are Jewish) received 83 percent of them.The ADL says, There is evidence that a considerable number of the anti-Semitic tweets targeting journalists originate with people identifying themselves as Trump supporters,  conservatives  or extreme right-wing elements. Thanks GOP, you ve built this! The party that is pro-Israel is now becoming the party that tells Jewish reporters to go  back to the ovens  when they report on Trump in a  negative  light.Journalists such as Politico s Hadas Gold, NYT s Jonathan Weisman, and Julia Ioffe have all faced disgusting and deplorable attacks, with Trump supporters painting ovens and Nazi-era  Juden  stars and bullet holes on their profiles.Gold, who was also profiled with a  Juden  star, told CNN:Anti-Semitism has a long history, but this election has brought about a rise in fear of the  other  and despite being a vital part of American history for hundreds of years, Jews are often still seen as the other.Weisman also spoke to CNN, and noted that it s not just Antisemitism that has up-ticked this election, but hatred all around:I am troubled by the uptick of hate in this country writ large. I would not be so bold as to say that Antisemitism on Twitter is the worst of it. I would say Muslims being beat up in the street, Hispanics being ostracized at school   those are far worse. This is just a single manifestation of growing hate and bullying in this country.And we all know whose fault that is. While Trump has been openly hostile to journalists   referring to them as  absolute scum  and saying that he hates them   he has also dog whistled antisemitism through his conspiracy riddled theories as to why he is losing. When Trump says  they  are part of a globalist, banking and media conspiracy against him, it doesn t take a genius to see who  they  pertains to. Just look back through history and browse white-supremacist websites. Whenever  they  are mentioned as holding all the power and influence, it s almost overwhelmingly referring to Jews.Hillary Clinton is right: a large chunk of Trump supporters are deplorables. They exhibit racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia and xenophobia. But now we have another notch to add to their belt: anti-Semitism.Featured image via Sean Rayford/Getty Images", "output": "0.

The Clinton family s mega-charity took in more than $140 million in grants and pledges in 2013 but spent just $9 million on direct aid. The group spent the bulk of its windfall on administration, travel, and salaries and bonuses, with the fattest payouts going to family friends. On its 2013 tax forms, the most recent available, the foundation claimed it spent $30 million on payroll and employee benefits; $8.7 million in rent and office expenses; $9.2 million on  conferences, conventions and meetings ; $8 million on fund-raising; and nearly $8.5 million on travel. None of the Clintons are on the payroll, but they do enjoy first-class flights paid for by the Foundation. In all, the group reported $84.6 million in  functional expenses  on its 2013 tax return and had more than $64 million left over   money the organization has said represents pledges rather than actual cash on hand. Some of the tens of millions in administrative costs finance more than 2,000 employees, including aid workers and health professionals around the world. But that s still far below the 75 percent rate of spending that nonprofit experts say a good charity should spend on its mission. Charity Navigator, which rates nonprofits, recently refused to rate the Clinton Foundation because its  atypical business model . . . doesn t meet our criteria.  Charity Navigator put the foundation on its  watch list,  which warns potential donors about investing in problematic charities. The 23 charities on the list include the Rev. Al Sharpton s troubled National Action Network, which is cited for failing to pay payroll taxes for several years. Other nonprofit experts are asking hard questions about the Clinton Foundation s tax filings in the wake of recent reports that the Clintons traded influence for donations.  It seems like the Clinton Foundation operates as a slush fund for the Clintons,  said Bill Allison, a senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group once run by leading progressive Democrat and Fordham Law professor Zephyr Teachout. In July 2013, Eric Braverman, a friend of Chelsea Clinton from when they both worked at McKinsey & Co., took over as CEO of the Clinton Foundation. He took home nearly $275,000 in salary, benefits and a housing allowance from the nonprofit for just five months  work in 2013, tax filings show. Less than a year later, his salary increased to $395,000, according to a report in Politico. Braverman abruptly left the foundation earlier this year, after a falling-out with the old Clinton guard over reforms he wanted to impose at the charity, Politico reported. Last month, Donna Shalala, a former secretary of health and human services under President Clinton, was hired to replace Braverman. Nine other executives received salaries over $100,000 in 2013, tax filings show. The group also failed to disclose millions of dollars it received in foreign donations from 2010 to 2012 and is hurriedly refiling five years  worth of tax returns after reporters raised questions about the discrepancies in its filings last week.Via: NY Post", "output": "0.

{"instruction": "Task: Please determine whether the text is 0. False, 1. TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: By James PerloffMy friend Rachael McIntosh was an alternate delegate at the 2012 Republican Convention in Tampa, Florida, representing Ron Paul for the state of Rhode Island.Rachael had worked for a private defense contractor for years. Awakened by the corruption and darkness she witnessed, she left the defense industry, and began working tirelessly toward getting Ron Paul elected. She has fictionalized her experiences in a superbly written trilogy of novels, Security through Absurdity.The Tampa convention was supposed to begin on Monday, August 27. Ron Paul was originally slated to speak, but the convention was cancelled for that evening due to the threat of a  hurricane.  The hurricane turned out to be no more than a brisk rainstorm. Rachael and many other Ron Paul delegates braved it that morning and went to the convention center (the Tampa Bay Times Forum, a sports complex) to watch Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus officially proclaim the delay. After the gravel had been struck and the chairman left the stage, the delegates found themselves watching a movie glorifying Mitt Romney. At the film s conclusion, Rachael heard ear-splitting applause. But when she looked around, almost no one was cheering. The applause was  canned the type sports stadiums pipe in when the home team is losing and their spectators show low enthusiasm.The next day at her hotel, Rachael s husband called and said:  Hey, I watched it yesterday and the crowd was really diggin  Romney.  Rachael had to break the news: what he (and the rest of America) heard on TV had been faked.The real blow to the Ron Paul people came when the Republican National Committee made last-minute rule changes. Under the existing rules, Paul had won enough primaries and caucuses (five) to have his name placed in nomination. Under the newrules, the required number of states would be increased to eight, thus rendering Paul s nomination impossible. Mitt Romney, who had already won sufficient delegates through dirty tricks during the primaries to become the  presumptive nominee,  would also be granted power to replace duly elected delegates with people of his own choosing.Naturally, Paul s delegates were anxious to vote on the rule changes. However, the convention busses showed up at their hotels late. The driver of Rachael s bus didn t seem to know the way to the convention center, got stuck in traffic, and took about two hours to complete the trip. By the time most of the Paul delegates reached the center, and passed through its heavy security, the vote was already over. Mitt Romney would be the Republican Convention s  unanimous  choice.Ron Paul was still offered a chance to make a speech, but only under two conditions: (1) that he endorse Romney; and (2) that the Republic National Committee first vet and approve the speech. Under these conditions, Paul acted on integrity and declined to speak.A word should be added about the media in Tampa. On the convention s last day, Rachael dressed up in funeral black and handed out cards offering condolences to America upon the loss of the democratic process. She gave one to a leading news journalist who said  I love it.  When Rachael asked if he would do a story on it, he literally replied:  It doesn t fit the pre-scripted narrative. Sorry. That the media was bound to a  pre-scripted narrative  was later proven when a brawl broke out between the Romney and Paul delegates, complete with screaming, pushing and shoving, right by the entrance to the press boxes (CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc.). Although the brawl should have been  news,  not a single journalist emerged with a camera to record it. After all, it didn t fit the  pre-scripted narrative namely, that Republicans unanimously supported Mitt Romney.What lesson can we draw from Rachael s experience? The same one that people have been learning the hard way for decades: that regardless of much you work for a Presidential candidate, the PTB (Powers That Be) will railroad their candidate to the top. The following quote from my 1988 book The Shadows of Power refers to the election year of 1952:At the Republican nominating convention,  dirty tricks  abounded. The rules for selecting delegates were changed: Taft delegations from Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas were thrown out and replaced by Eisenhower supporters. I.e., the same sort of tactics that Ron Paul s supporters faced in 2012 were used at the GOP Convention 60 years earlier. I ll add that Dwight Eisenhower had no previous affiliation with the Republican Party; the Democratic Party had tried to draft him in 1948, and President Harry Truman (Democrat) had approached him about running on the same ticket. Above: Nixon and Eisenhower at the 1952 conventionLet s kick it back to 1940. Seven weeks before the GOP Convention, a poll showed only three percent of Republicans favored candidate Wendell Willkie, who, prior to that year, had been a registered Democrat. But with powerful magic, Willkie got the nomination. Ten-term Congressman Usher Burdick of North Dakota said of this:We Republicans in the west want to know if Wall Street and the international bankers control our party and can select our candidate? I believe I am serving the best interests of the Republican Party by protesting and exposing the machinations and attempts of J.P. Morgan and the New York utility bankers in forcing Wendell Willkie on the Republican Party. . . .There is nothing to the Willkie boom for President except the artificial public opinion being created by newspapers, magazines, and the radio. The reason back of all this is money. Money is being spent by someone, and lots of it. PHOTO: Wendell Willkie PHOTO: Usher Burdick (right) in 1958 with Ezra PoundFor those who wonder if such phenomena only happen to Republicans, Bernie Sanders can already  feel the spurn.  He won New Hampshire by a landslide (60 to 38 percent) only to discover that Hillary Clinton had been awarded the majority of delegates. This is because the Democratic Party has 717  superdelegates  who support whomever they prefer, regardless of the wishes of voters or primary results.Go back to 1976. According to a Gallup poll, just seven months before the Democratic National Convention, less than four percent of Democratic voters favored Jimmy Carter for President. What happened? As Lawrence Shoup noted in The Carter Presidency and Beyond:What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.How did Carter acquire this media following? It began at a dinner with Republican David Rockefeller  kingmaker of the Establishment at the latter s Tarrytown, New York estate. Also present was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who helped Rockefeller found the internationalist Trilateral Commission, and whom Carter would later appoint National Security Adviser. The media blitz included adulatory pieces in the New York Times, and a Wall Street Journal editorial declaring that Carter was the best Democratic candidate. Before the nominating convention, his picture appeared on the cover of Time three times, and Newsweek twice. Time s cover artists were even instructed to make him look as much as possible like John F. Kennedy. The TV networks inundated the public with his image.As former Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater said:David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski found Jimmy Carter to be their ideal candidate. They helped him win the nomination and the presidency. To accomplish this purpose, they mobilized the money power of the Wall Street bankers, the intellectual influence of the academic community   which is subservient to the wealth of the great tax-free foundations   and the media controllers represented in the membership of the CFR and the Trilateral.If you want to glimpse how far back this sort of power-brokering goes, read Ferdinand Lundberg s 1937 classic America s Sixty Families. He related how, a century ago, the rich were scorning voters and maneuvering their own choices into nominations, whether a Democrat like Woodrow Wilson in 1912 or a Republican like Herbert Hoover in 1928.The 2016 RaceWhat about this year? Who have the  PTB  anointed to become President? While I am of course not privy to their conclaves, I believe their chosen one, as I stated in my blog post of February 15, is Hillary Clinton. There are several indicators:(1) Despite her  anti-Wall Street  rhetoric, Hillary receives by far the most donations from Wall Street of any candidate. Jeb Bush competed with her for that distinction, but since Jeb s personality proved too lackluster to muster enough votes to stay in the race, Hillary holds the honor alone. Above: Hillary partakes in groundbreaking ceremony for Goldman Sachs  new headquarters in 2005. (2) Of the viable candidates, only Hillary is committed to 100 percent of the Rothschild agenda:  pro  War on Terror    pro Israel   pro gun control   pro GMO (Monsanto)   pro population control (abortion, vaccines, etc.)   pro  climate change  control   pro mass immigration   pro Internet censorship   pro gay agenda   pro TPP (she is currently backing off on this because of voter concern about jobs, but before running she said  This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements, and was a strong proponent of the job-destroying NAFTA and GATT agreements)(3) I ll interject here that Rachael McIntosh told me she believes that in 2008, an understanding was reached concerning Obama and Clinton, both of whom were running that year. Obama would become the first black President; Hillary s turn would arrive in due time, and she would become the first woman President. Having a black or woman in the Oval Office, of course, gives the public the illusion that they are  empowered  and that the Establishment has somehow been stymied, whereas in fact both Obama and Hillary are flunkies for the Establishment. I agree with Rachael s assessment 100 percent.And so it was that Obama appointed Hillary his Secretary of State, a move clearly intended to give her a  foreign policy expertise  credential for the 2016 Presidential campaign. After Clinton left the position (2013), CBS began airing (2014) its still-running drama Madam Secretary, all about a blonde woman Secretary of State. Subliminal Advertising: Hollywood began campaigning for Hillary Clinton in 2014.  Beginning with the very first episode, in which  Madam Secretary  rescued American hostages held in Syria, viewers would receive a weekly dose of subliminal propaganda for Hillary s campaign, portraying her as beautiful, heroic, honest and competent.(4) Prior to being Secretary of State, Hillary served as U.S. Senator from New York. She had never lived in New York before, but the state is the center of America s banking industry, and has been a launching point for Presidential candidates such as the Roosevelts. Serving a Senate term, of course, would also give Hillary an important  can work with Congress  credential for her Presidential run. There is considerable Internet buzz that John F. Kennedy, Jr., who had long lived in New York, was planning to run for the Senate in 2000, the same year as Clinton. The handsome son of the popular President would likely have defeated Clinton, adding interest to Kennedy s death in a suspicious plane crash on July 16, 1999, especially in light of what has been termed the Clinton Body Count.(5) Perhaps most importantly, the Establishment has already marked Hillary with their stamp of approval by entrusting her with two terms in the White House. Yes, Bill Clinton was President then, but if Hillary is elected, Bill will of course be returning.Will the email or Benghazi scandals derail her Presidential bid? I doubt it. During Bill s tenure, the Clintons were plagued by innumerable scandals besides mysterious deaths: sex charges, perjury, Whitewater,  Chinagate,   Travelgate,  drug allegations connected with his Arkansas governorship, Hillary s incredible cattle futures profits, etc. Yet although many pundits back then claimed these scandals would lead to impeachment, the Clintons always remained untouched by justice. So far, nothing seems to have changed. However, Hillary s scandals do give the Establishment a blackmailer s leash on her; i.e., if she ever steps out of line, prosecutions could suddenly materialize.What about the other candidates currently running? All of them share some of Hillary s positions, but none do 100 percent. Bernie Sanders is too opposed to banker bailouts to be acceptable, even though the Establishment is OK with his socialism (since, in an illusional democracy, empowering government empowers them). Cruz s wife Heidi is a former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a vice president at Goldman Sachs, from whom Cruz s Senate campaign received a million-dollar loan; but his positions on matters like abortion, gun control and immigration don t pass muster Continue this story at James PerloffREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files", "output": "0.

Immediately after the verdict was issued, protesters gathered downtown near Tucker Boulevard and Market Street.

I think the verdict is disgusting,  said Smith, who is black.  I m proud of these people protesting. If you look like me, then you feel like there is no other way to express yourself in the face of this kind of verdict. Time and time again, African American men are killed by police and nobody is held accountable. The judge explained his rationale for the verdict in a 30-page document filed about 8:30 a.m. Friday. No one promised a rose garden, and this surely is not one,  he wrote of the case. This court, as the trier of fact, is simply not firmly convinced of defendant s guilt. Agonizingly, this court has pored over the evidence again and again   This court, in conscience, cannot say that the state has proven every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt or that the defendant did not act in self-defense. Because the state did not prove Stockley did not act in self-defense, Wilson wrote that he could not address lesser charges of homicide or manslaughter. St. Louis Police Department called for peace:We know emotions are running high, however we ask that those who choose to protest, do so peacefully. #STLVerdict  St. Louis, MO Police (@SLMPD) September 15, 2017The fiance of the victim Anthony Lamar Smith, Christina Wilson, bravely stood in front of a microphone just prior to the court s announcement and asked for protesters to not resort to violence.

I am sobered by this outcome. Frustration, anger, hurt, pain, hope and love all intermingled. I encourage St. Louisans to show each other compassion, to recognize that we all have different experiences and backgrounds and that we all come to this with real feelings and experiences,  she wrote.Krewson s comment drew a rebuke from Neil Bruntrager, Stockley s lawyer. How do you promote all those things by creating distrust in a system that clearly worked under these circumstances?  Bruntrager said.  It is irresponsible and a disservice to the community to make statements like that. It s an insult to Judge Wilson to make statements like that.

Fred Warmbier spoke to the media about his son Otto s comatose state and imprisonment by the North Korean regime.After thanking Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) for his support and assistance, Warmbier recounted how his son was freed. When Otto was first taken, we were advised by the past administration to take a low profile while they worked to obtain his release,  Warmbier said.  We did so without result. Earlier this year, Cindy and I decided the time for strategic patience was over, and we made a few media appearances and traveled to Washington to meet with Ambassador Joe Yun at the State Department. He said it was his understanding that Ambassador Yun, at the direction of President Donald Trump,  aggressively pursued resolution of the situation. They have our thanks for bringing Otto home,  he said.He described his son s return as bittersweet. Relief that Otto is now home in arms of those who love him and anger that he was so brutally treated for so long,  he said.Warmbier also said he received a phone call from President Trump late Wednesday that he described as  kind. The last thing liberals want to hear the father of Otto Warbmier is that he was grateful for President Trump s help in bringing his son home or that he would describe him as being  kind. WFB   Warmbier had this to say about the North Korean regime at a news conference at Wyoming High School where Otto graduated in 2013 as class salutatorian: They are a pariah regime They re brutal and terroristic. The University of Virginia student returned to Ohio late Tuesday and hospitalized after being detained for 18 months in the Hermit Kingdom after being convicted of stealing a propaganda poster from a hotel.His father said he is stable,  but has suffered a severe neurological injury. Warmbier took questions from the media, including from one reporter who asked more about the Obama administration s handling of Otto s imprisonment. You thanked President Trump and then you also said that the past administration didn t do enough, so do you feel like then-President Obama should have been doing more to help?  the reporter asked.After restating the question for other reporters who could not hear it, Warmbier gave a quick answer. The question was, do I think the past administration could have done more? I think the results speak for themselves,  Warmbier said.Watch:", "output": "0. Fake"}

In the video Cindy Almodovar who spoke with Huma Abedin about email issues that were going on admits that the FBI didn’t interview her. In December, 2010, U.S. Department of State IT Systems Administrator Cindy Almodovar reported that she met with Huma Abedin for thirty minutes regarding emails at the then unknown, but now notorious, @ clintonemail.com site. Here’s is the text from that email exchange: “From: Almodovar, Cindy T Sent: Friday, December 17, 2010 11:17 AM To: SES-IRM_Tech Cc: SES-IRM_FO-Mgt Subject: Meeting with Huma I met with Huma for about 30 minutes to go over mail issues. She gave me some examples listed below, but also, things are inconsistent. But issue #1 is of an e-mail which was sent to her twice this morning, did get received on <REDACTED> but was not delivered. See details below. I have a contact for the @clintonemail site, his name is Bryan Pagliano and he actually now works for State, but he apparently set all of this up. Huma sent several tests from her clintonemail account to Lona and myself – they were received. But there are many messages and responses not received. She sent a message this morning from her state.gov account to cheftwan@mail.house.gov.On 12/14, hdr22@clintonemail.com sent a message to huma@clintonemail.com and Valmoroli@state.gov at 10:03 pm . The subject line was blank. Huma received at Clinton address, but Lona did not receive on her state.gov account.” As a result of subsequent investigations regarding Secretary Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. State Department reported the following: From the unclassified May 2016 State Department report ESP-16-03: Two staff in S/ES-IRM reported to OIG that, in late 2010, they each discussed their concerns about Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email account in separate meetings with the then-Director of S/ES-IRM. In one meeting, one staff member raised concerns that information sent and received on Secretary Clinton’s account could contain Federal records that needed to be preserved in order to satisfy Federal recordkeeping requirements. According to the staff member, the Director stated that the Secretary’s personal system had been reviewed and approved by Department legal staff and that the matter was not to be discussed any further. As previously noted, OIG found no evidence that staff in the Office of the Legal Adviser reviewed or approved Secretary Clinton’s personal system. According to the other S/ES-IRM staff member who raised concerns about the server, the Director stated that the mission of S/ES-IRM is to support the Secretary and instructed the staff never to speak of the Secretary’s personal email system again. The director referred in the OIG report is John Bentel. In 2010, he was the State Department employee who managed IT security issues for the top echelon of the department. He told FBI investigators those conversations back in 2010 never occurred. In March of 2016, Bentel refused to answer questions from Senate investigators and asserted his Fifth Amendment right 87 times during a deposition for a civil lawsuit related to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.” Here’s a transcript of the exchange between Project Veritas’s journalist and Cindy Almodovar. PV Journalist: I’m working on a story. I’m interested. I want to know the truth and I want to know if you’re one of the people who came, who went to John Bentel and said they were concerned about Hillary’s private server. Almodovar: I don’t know anything about that. PV Journalist: You weren’t involved in that at all? Almodovar: You’ve got to stop this because this is like harassment.

Now, he has picked racist Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions to be his Attorney General. Sessions is a guy who couldn t even get confirmed as a federal judge by the United States Senate in 1986 because he was too racist. Well, progressive firebrand and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is having none of it, and is demanding that Trump dump Sessions.Senator Warren issues a blistering statement rebuking both Sessions and Trump, which read: Instead of embracing the bigotry that fueled his campaign rallies, I urge President-elect Trump to reverse his apparent decision to nominate Senator Sessions to be Attorney General of the United States. If he refuses, then it will fall to the Senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation and all of its people. Thirty years ago, a different Republican Senate rejected Senator Sessions  nomination to a federal judgeship. In doing so, that Senate affirmed that there can be no compromise with racism; no negotiation with hate. Today, a new Republican Senate must decide whether self-interest and political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing what is right. The heart of this statement is what is important; after all, we know that Trump has not the moral character to realize why picking Sessions, white nationalist Steve Bannon, or any of the other appalling people in his inner circle to fill out his administration is such a huge problem. Therefore, it will be up to the Senate to do their jobs and to deny Sessions his confirmation. Unfortunately, Bannon s appointment is all in Trump s hands, so he s in the White House for the long haul. However, Sessions is a different story. Therefore, the Senators who are elected to represent ALL of the people need to do their jobs and reject the bigots Trump is busily nominating.I know that Donald Trump values loyalty above all else   that goes back to the undeniable fact that he has serious authoritarian tendencies. Sessions has been loyal, and this job is his reward. However, one of the most important jobs of the Attorney General is to enforce civil rights laws and to protect minorities. Therefore, Sessions would be an absolute threat to minorities in that role. Senate   no matter your party affiliation   do your jobs and follow in the footsteps of your honorable predecessors, and refuse to confirm Jeff Sessions as the top law enforcement officer of the United States.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images", "output": "0.

While both candidates may be \"flawed\" from the perspective of moral values, a breakdown of their positions shows clearly that America will go down one of two very different roads today. \nBelow are some of the candidates' more notable stances and quotes on moral issues, as well as the positions each party platform takes. \nABORTION \nHillary Clinton: supports taxpayer-funded abortion through all nine months of pregnancy. has promised to repeal the Hyde Amendment, the law prohibiting the use of tax dollars for Medicaid abortions. said she will stand with and fund Planned Parenthood, America's largest abortion provider. defended partial-birth and late-term abortion in her final debate with Donald Trump. Here are some of her most notable abortion quotes: \"The unborn person doesn't have constitutional rights.\" \"Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources, and political will. Deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed.\" \"I believe that forcing a woman to carry a child who she knows will die is an assault...\" \"[Family] planning is an important part of women's health, and reproductive health includes access to abortion.\" \"We've gotta continue to stand up for a woman's right to make these decisions--and to defend Planned Parenthood.\" \"I support Roe v. Wade.\" \"Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account and when I voted as a senator [against banning partial-birth abortion], I did not think that that was [the] case.\" \"The kinds of [abortion] cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get: that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term, or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions for women. So, you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and health of the mother taken into account...this is one of the worst possible choices any woman and her family has to make.\" \"I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in China or force women to bear children like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice, and I will stand up for that right.\" \"Now, extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect that from people who don’t want to live in the modern world, but it’s a little hard to take from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States.\" \"I’ve been proud to stand with Planned Parenthood for a long time, and, as president, I will always have your back.\" \"I'm grateful to the entire Planned Parenthood family. You made this campaign your own...It belongs to the staff, the donors, and to the [abortion] providers...It is worth saying again: defending women’s health means defending access to abortion – not just in theory, but in reality...We need to stand up for access to affordable contraception without interference from politicians or employers. And let's invest in long-acting contraceptives, so every woman can choose the method that is best for her.” \nDonald Trump: promised to sign the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would end painful, gruesome late-term abortions. pledged to defund Planned Parenthood. says he will appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices. Here are some of Trump's more notable quotes on abortion: “If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that’s okay, and Hillary can say that that’s okay, but it’s not okay with me because based on what she’s saying and based on where she's going and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day, and that’s not acceptable...Honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth, nobody has that.\" \"I am, and will remain, pro-life.\" \"Let me be clear — I am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me...Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago, over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of this country. They are missing, and they are missed. The Supreme Court in 1973 based its decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found...Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best...A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.\" \nRELIGIOUS FREEEDOM \nHillary Clinton: has said \"religious beliefs\" against abortion \"have to be changed.\" supports the Obama administration's HHS contraception and abortion mandate, which forces religious institutions and churches to fund abortions. Here are some of her more notable quotes on religious freedom: \"Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources, and political will. Deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed.\" “[The Hobby Lobby case is] the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom, which means the corporation’s … [‘closely held’] employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees, and, of course, denying women the right to contraceptives as part of a health care plan is exactly that. I find it deeply disturbing that we are going in that direction. It’s very troubling that a sales clerk at Hobby Lobby who need[s] contraception, which is pretty expensive, is not going to get that service through her employer’s health care plan because her employer doesn’t think she should be using contraception.\" \"Every woman, no matter where she works, deserves birth control coverage. This shouldn't be a question.\" \nDonald Trump: has promised to repeal the Johnson Amendment, which threatens churches with the loss of their tax statuses if they endorse political candidates. says he will fight on behalf of Christians in the Middle East who are facing genocide. Here are some of his more notable quotes on religious freedom: \"I have a message for Catholics: I will be there for you. I will stand with you. I will fight for you. \"As First Lady, US Senator, Secretary of State, and two-time presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton has been hostile to the core issues and policies of greatest concern to Catholics: life, religious liberty, Supreme Court nominations, affordable and quality healthcare, educational choice and home schooling. \"For instance, Hillary Clinton supports forcing The Little Sisters of the Poor who have taken care of the elderly poor since 1839, to pay for contraceptives in their healthcare plan (even though they have never wanted them, never used them and never will), and having the government fine them heavily if they continue to refuse to abide by this onerous mandate. \"This is a hostility to religious liberty you will never see in a Trump administration.\" \"I will defend your religious liberties and the right to fully and freely practice your religion, as individuals, business owners and academic institutions. I will make absolutely certain religious orders like The Little Sisters of Poor are not bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs. I will protect and work to expand educational choice, the rights of homeschooling families, and end Common Core. I will repeal and replace Obamacare so you can have better and more affordable healthcare. I will keep our country and communities safe while respecting the dignity of each human being. I will help Catholic families and workers, and all families and workers, by bringing jobs back to our country where they belong. And I will appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not legislate from the bench, like Justice Clarence Thomas and the late and beloved great Catholic thinker and jurist, Justice Antonin Scalia.\" \n\nSAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND THE LGBT MOVEMENT \nHillary Clinton: touts herself as a champion of the \"LGBT community.\" wants to criminalize therapy helping minors resolve unwanted same-sex attraction. will \"protect transgender rights.\" says she will \"fight for full federal equality for LGBT Americans\" by making gender identity and sexual orientation federally protected classes. Here are a few of her many pro-LGBT statements: \"Gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\" \"Thanks to the bravery of LGBT Americans like Jim Obergefell and Edie Windsor, and the determination and tireless organizing of the LGBT community and their allies, marriage equality became the law of the land in all 50 states...we've also seen how much work is still unfinished....Discriminatory laws in states like North Carolina highlight the need for full federal equality under the law for LGBT Americans.\" \"Along with millions of Americans, I am celebrating today's landmark victory for marriage equality, and the generations of advocates and activists who fought to make it possible. From Stonewall to the Supreme Court, the courage and determination of the LGBT community has changed hearts and changed laws. \"This ruling is an affirmation of the commitment of couples across the country who love one another. It reflects the will of the vast and growing multitude of Americans who believe that LGBT couples deserve to be recognized under the law and treated equally in the eyes of society. And it represents our country at its best: inclusive, open, and striving towards true equality. \"But we know that the struggle for LGBT rights doesn't end with today's triumph. As love and joy flood our streets today, it is hard to imagine how anyone could deny the full protection of our laws to any of our fellow Americans—but there are those who would. So while we celebrate the progress won today, we must stand firm in our conviction to keep moving forward. For too many LGBT Americans who are subjected to discriminatory laws, true equality is still just out of reach. While we celebrate today, our work won't be finished until every American can not only marry, but live, work, pray, learn and raise a family free from discrimination and prejudice. We cannot settle for anything less.\" \"I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.\" \nDonald Trump: says marriage is ultimately an issue that should be decided by the states. says he supports natural marriage. says that he will \"fight\" for the LGBT community, especially as he fights ISIS and radical Islam. Here are some of Trump's more notable quotes on same-sex \"marriage\" and the \"LGBT community\": “Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.” \"As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.\" \"We’re going to look at judges. They’ve got to be great judges. They’ve got to be conservative judges. We’re going to see how they stand depending on what their views are. But that would be my preference [that they oppose same-sex 'marriage]. I would prefer that they stand against, but we’ll see what happens. It depends on the judge.\" “I would strongly consider that, yes,\" in response to a question about whether he would appoint justices to overrule the Supreme Court's same-sex \"marriage\" decision. “[Marriage] should be a states rights issue. I can see changes coming down the line, frankly.” \n\nTHE CANDIDATE'S CAMPAIGN WEBSITES \nFrom the official Hillary Clinton campaign site: \"Hillary will work with Congress to pass the Equality Act, continue President Obama’s LGBT equality executive actions, and support efforts underway in the courts to protect people from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in every aspect of public life...Hillary will end so-called 'conversion therapy' for minors, combat youth homelessness by ensuring adequate funding for safe and welcoming shelters, and take on bullying and harassment in schools. She’ll end discriminatory treatment of LGBT families in adoptions, and protect LGBT elders against discrimination....Hillary applauds the Pentagon’s decision to allow transgender personnel to serve openly, and as Commander-in-Chief, she will upgrade service records of LGBT veterans dismissed due to their sexual orientation...Hillary will work to protect transgender individuals from violence, make it easier for transgender Americans to change their gender marker on identification documents, and invest in law enforcement training focused on fair and impartial policing, including in interactions with LGBT people.\" \"Hillary will promote LGBT human rights and ensure America’s foreign policy is inclusive of LGBT people, including increasing our investment in the Global Equality Fund to advance human rights.\" \"In the U.S. Senate, Hillary championed legislation to address hate crimes, fought for federal non-discrimination legislation to protect LGBT Americans in the workplace, and advocated for an end to restrictions that blocked LGBT Americans from adopting children. \"As secretary of state, Hillary advanced LGBT rights abroad and enforced stronger anti-discrimination regulations within the State Department, declaring on the global stage that 'gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.' She led the effort to pass the first-ever U.N. Resolution on LGBT Human Rights, launched the Global Equality Fund, ended State Department regulations that denied same-sex couples and their families equal rights, helped implement LGBT-friendly workplace policies, and updated the State Department’s policy so that transgender individuals’ passports reflect their true gender.\" \nDonald Trump's official campaign website does not mention his stances on abortion or marriage. \n\nTHE PARTY PLATFORMS \nRepublican platform: Against abortion, against Planned Parenthood, pro-religious liberty, pro-marriage, pro-homeschooling, pro-sexual risk avoidance education “The Constitution’s guarantee that no one can 'be deprived of life, liberty or property' deliberately echoes the Declaration of Independence’s proclamation that 'all' are 'endowed by their Creator' with the inalienable right to life. Accordingly, we assert the sanctity of human life and afrm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections apply to children before birth.” “We oppose the use of public funds to perform or promote abortion or to fund organizations, like Planned Parenthood, so long as they provide or refer for elective abortions or sell fetal body parts rather than provide healthcare.” “We support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.\" “We value the right of America’s religious leaders to preach, and Americans to speak freely, according to their faith. Republicans believe the federal government, specically the IRS, is constitutionally prohibited from policing or censoring speech based on religious convictions or beliefs, and therefore we urge the repeal of the Johnson Amendment.” “We support options for learning, including home-schooling, career and technical education, private or parochial schools, magnet schools, charter schools, online learning, and early-college high schools. We especially support the innovative nancing mechanisms that make options available to all children: education savings accounts (ESAs), vouchers, and tuition tax credits.” “We renew our call for replacing 'family planning' programs for teens with sexual risk avoidance education that sets abstinence until marriage as the responsible and respected standard of behavior.” “We condemn the Supreme Court’s ruling in United States v. Windsor, which wrongly removed the ability of Congress to dene marriage policy in federal law. We also condemn the Supreme Court’s lawless ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges….In Obergefell, ve unelected lawyers robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to dene marriage as the union of one man and one woman.” \nDemocrat platform: Taxpayer funded abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, pro-Planned Parenthood, pro-LGBT, pro-contraception sex ed “Democrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice. We believe unequivocally that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion—regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured. We believe that reproductive health is core to women’s, men’s, and young people’s health and wellbeing…. We will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment.” “We will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions of people.” “We will appoint judges who defend the constitutional principles of liberty and equality for all, protect a woman’s right to safe and legal abortion, curb billionaires’ inuence over elections because they understand that Citizens United has fundamentally damaged our democracy, and see the Constitution as a blueprint for progress.” “Democrats know that our nation, our communities, and our lives are made vastly stronger and richer by faith in many forms and the countless acts of justice, mercy, and tolerance it inspires. We believe in lifting up and valuing the good work of people of faith and religious organizations and nding ways to support that work where possible.\" “Democrats are also committed to providing parents with high-quality public school options and expanding these options for low-income youth. We support great neighborhood public schools and high-quality public charter schools, and we will help them disseminate best practices to other school leaders and educators. Democrats oppose for-prot charter schools focused on making a prot off of public resources.” “We recognize that quality, affordable comprehensive health care, evidence-based sex education, and a full range of family planning services help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies.\" “Democrats applaud last year’s decision by the Supreme Court that recognized LGBT people—like every other American—have the right to marry the person they love. But there is still much work to be done.\" \nThis article originallly appeared on LifeSiteNews.com , with commentary provided by TRUNEWS Article by Doc Burkhart , Vice-President, General Manager and co-host of TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles Got a news tip?

Recipient Name Recipient Email => \n‘Make America Great Again’ was the slogan of Donald Trump’s election, but the immediate impact of his victory is to make the US less of a power in the world for two reasons: American prestige and influence will be damaged by a general belief internationally that the US has just elected a dangerous buffoon as its leader. The perception is pervasive, but is not very deeply rooted and likely be temporary, stemming as it does from Trump’s demagogic rants during the election campaign. Those about relations with foreign countries were particularly vague and least likely to provide a guide to future policy. \nMore damaging in the long term for America’s status as superpower is the likelihood that the US is now a more deeply divided society than ever. Trump won the election by demonising and threatening individuals and communities – Mexicans, Muslims, Latinos – and his confrontational style of politics is not going to disappear. Verbal violence produces a permanently over-heated political atmosphere in which physical violence becomes an option. At the same time, the election campaign was focused almost exclusively on American domestic politics with voters showing little interest in events abroad. This is unlikely to change. \nGovernments around the world can see this for themselves, though this will not stop them badgering their diplomats in Washington and New York for an inkling as to how far Trump’s off-the-cuff remarks were more than outrageous attempts to dominate the news agenda for a few hours. Fortunately, his pronouncements were so woolly that they can be easily jettisoned between now and his inauguration. Real foreign policy positions will only emerge with the formation of a Trump cabinet when it becomes clear who will be in charge. \nBut, if future policies remain unknowable, super-charged American nationalism combined with economic populism and isolationism are likely to set the general tone. Trump has invariably portrayed Americans as the victims of the foul machinations of foreign countries who previously faced no real resistance from an incompetent self-serving American elite. \nThis sort of aggressive nationalism is not unique to Trump. All over the world nationalism is having a spectacular rebirth in countries from Turkey to the Philippines. It has become a successful vehicle for protest in Britain, France, Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe. Though Trump is frequently portrayed as a peculiarly American phenomenon, his populist nationalism has a striking amount in common with that of the Brexit campaigners in Britain or even the chauvinism of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey. Much of this can be discounted as patriotic bombast, but in all cases there is a menacing undercurrent of racism and demonisation, whether it is directed against illegal immigrants in the US, asylum seekers in the Britain or Kurds in south east Turkey. \nIn reality, Trump made very few proposals for radical change in US foreign policy during the election campaign, aside from saying that he would throw out the agreement with Iran on its nuclear programme – though his staff is now being much less categorical about this, saying only that the deal must be properly enforced. Nobody really knows if Trump will deal any differently from Obama with the swathe of countries between Pakistan and Nigeria where there are at least seven wars raging – Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and South Sudan – as well as four serious insurgencies. \nThe most serious wars in which the US is already militarily involved are in Iraq and Syria and here Trump’s comments during the campaign suggest that he will focus on destroying Isis, recognise the danger of becoming militarily over-involved and look for some sort of cooperation with Russia as the next biggest player in the conflict. This is similar to what is already happening. \nHillary Clinton’s intentions in Syria, though never fully formulated, always sounded more interventionist than Trump’s. One of her senior advisers openly proposed giving less priority to the assault on Isis and more to getting rid of President Bashar al-Assad. To this end, a third force of pro-US militant moderates was to be raised that would fight and ultimately defeat both Isis and Assad. Probably this fantasy would never have come to pass, but the fact that it was ever given currency underlines the extent to which Clinton was at one with the most dead-in-the-water conventional wisdom of the foreign policy establishment in Washington. \nPresident Obama developed a much more acute sense of what the US could and could not do in the Middle East and beyond, without provoking crises exceeding its political and military strength. Its power may be less than before the failed US interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan following 9/11, but it is still far greater than any other country’s. Currently, it is the US which is successfully coordinating the offensive against Isis’s last strongholds in Mosul and Raqqa by a multitude of fractious parties in Iraq and Syria. It was never clear how seriously one should have taken Clinton’s proposals for “safe zones” and trying to fight Isis and Assad at the same time, but her judgements on events in the Middle East since the Iraq invasion of 2003 all suggested a flawed idea of what was feasible. \nTrump’s instincts generally seem less well-informed but often shrewd, and his priories have nothing to do with the Middle East. Past US leaders have felt the same way, but they usually end up by being dragged into its crises one way or other, and how they perform then becomes the test of their real quality as a leader. The region has been the political graveyard for three of the last five US presidents: Jimmy Carter was destroyed by the consequences of the Iranian revolution; Ronald Reagan was gravely weakened by the Iran-Contra scandal; and George W Bush’s years in office will be remembered chiefly for the calamities brought on by his invasion of Iraq. Barack Obama was luckier and more sensible, but he wholly underestimated the rise of Isis until it captured Mosul in 2014.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Republicans need to stop whining about President Obama offering condolences for Fidel Castro s death, because they ve offered condolences for even worse monsters.After news of the longtime Cuban dictator s death, President Obama issued the following statement:At this time of Fidel Castro s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans   in Cuba and in the United States   with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him. Today, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. In the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.President Obama s statement was much different from Donald Trump s, which seemed to celebrate Castro s death. Indeed, Trump s statement is the kind of dangerous reaction that could damage international relations between nations at a time when we should be seeking peace.Republicans, of course, have been attacking President Obama ever since. Marco Rubio called Obama s statement  pathetic.  Ted Cruz says the United States should not send anyone to represent America at the funeral.But once again, just like they did when President Obama did not attend former First Lady Nancy Reagan s funeral, Republicans are conveniently forgetting history and precedent.As it turns out, the Republicans themselves sent condolences after a brutal dictator died on two occasions. In 1953, President Eisenhower offered condolences upon learning that Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was near death.At this moment in history when multitudes of Russians are anxiously concerned because of the illness of the Soviet ruler2 the thoughts of America go out to all the people of the U.S.S.R. the men and women, the boys and girls in the villages, cities, farms and factories of their homeland.They are the children of the same God who is the Father of all peoples everywhere. And like all peoples, Russia s millions share our longing for a friendly and peaceful world.Regardless of the identity of government personalities, the prayer of us Americans continues to be that the Almighty will watch over the people of that vast country and bring them, in His wisdom, opportunity to live their lives in a world where all men and women and children dwell in peace and comradeship.That s right. Republicans sent condolences for a brutal dictator who murdered at least 10 million people and is known as one of the worst mass murderers of the 20th century.After Stalin died, Eisenhower even offered praise of Stalin and reached out to the Russian people in his  Chance for Peace  speech.The world knows that an era ended with the death of Joseph Stalin. The extraordinary 30-year span of his rule saw the Soviet Empire expand to reach from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of Japan, finally to dominate 800 million souls.The Soviet system shaped by Stalin and his predecessors was born of one World War. It survived with stubborn and often amazing courage a second World War. It has lived to threaten a third.Now a new leadership has assumed power in the Soviet Union. Its links to the past, however strong, cannot bind it completely. Its future is, in great part, its own to make.The United States was even represented at Stalin s funeral by U.S. Ambassador Jacob Beam.And when Mao Tse-tung died in September 1976, President Gerald Ford sent the following condolences: Mrs. Ford joins me in extending to you our deepest sympathy on the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Chairman Mao had a profound impact on his era. . . . Please accept my personal condolences. So by attacking President Obama, Republicans are being total hypocrites. Yes, Fidel Castro was a terrible person. But he was still a human being and many people are mourning him in Cuba. Sending condolences is the human thing to do and it s the American way even if the foreign leader who died was our enemy. By extending our hand in friendship, we are sending a message to the Cuban people letting them know that we are with them and that we still want to work with them to make a better world for both of our nations. It s how diplomacy works. Petty statements like Trump s only do more harm than good.Featured image via Cagle", "output": "0. Fake"}

They know POTUS and HRC emailed . Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet’s email addresses.\nPerhaps while the DOJ/FBI is taking a second look into Huma Abedin’s emails, it can also take a repeat look at some of these, especially the ones involving POTUS.

But sometimes, you have to wonder what would have happened had a gun been introduced to a situation   especially if the threat in question is the educator the GOP wants to arm.Mary Hastings, a 63-year-old teacher at Ozen High School in Texas, was arrested for assault Friday after horrifying video surfaced showing her beating an African-American student. Hastings, who is white, can be seen (apparently) accusing the student of interfering with another student s graduation. She then calls the boy  idiot ass  as she throws the unnamed (and most importantly, noncombative) African-American student s papers off of his desk and hits him in the head repeatedly. When he asks why she did that, she mocks him   because that s apparently what adults do these days.Hastings was removed from the classroom and placed on paid administrative leave. She was released on $2,500 bond and slapped with a  misdemeanor assault charge. In a statement, Beaumont Independent School District s Special Assistant to the Superintendent, Nakisha Burns, explained that the teacher would be terminated and vowed that such abuse would not be tolerated:The Beaumont Independent School District can confirm that an Ozen High School teacher was arrested today for physically assaulting a student. The conduct was substantiated by video footage viewed by BISD police and administration. The District is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our students. BISD does not condone employees abusing any child and will not tolerate such conduct. The teacher was immediately removed from the classroom and placed on administrative leave pending action on her contract.If this is the sort of person the GOP wants to arm, it is certainly a chilling thought.

D. Heyes Tags: Ammon Bundy , Oregon ranchers , court decision (NaturalNews) In what freedom fighters across the country are calling a stunning victory against a tyrannical government agency, a jury in Oregon has acquitted all seven defendants involved in the armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge in January.Cheers broke out in the Portland, Ore., federal courtroom when the jury announced the acquittals of Ammon Bundy, along with brother Ryan Bundy and five others, the Chicago Tribune reported .The seven were charged with conspiracy to impede federal workers from their jobs at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which is located about 300 miles southeast of Portland. Also, the jury could not reach a verdict on even one count of theft for Ryan Bundy. Shocked by the acquittals The announcement by the jury did not come without additional drama, however. Upon hearing the jury's decision, Marcus Mumford, one of Ammon Bundy's attorneys, demanded his client be released, even shouting at the judge. That prompted U.S. marshals to tackle Mumford to the ground and use a stun gun on him a number of times before arresting him, the Tribune reported.U.S. District Judge Anna Brown said she was not able to release Bundy because he faces federal charges in Nevada, his home state, related to an armed standoff with federal Bureau of Land Management agents at his father Cliven Bundy's ranch in 2014 .As reported by KATU , the armed standoff began Jan. 2 and lasted nearly six weeks. The incident brought new attention to the long-running issue of too much federal ownership of lands in the American West. The confrontations at the refuge earlier this year and on Cliven Bundy's ranch in 2014 essentially reignited arguments between private citizens – mostly ranchers – and the federal government that stem from the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion in the late 1970s, when Western states like Nevada attempted to wrestle more control of their own territory from the federal government .As noted by The New York Times the federal government owns nearly half of the land – 47 percent – in the West.The Tribune noted that even the defendants' attorneys were shocked by the acquittals.\"It's stunning,\" said Robert Salisbury, an attorney for defendant Jeff Banta. \"It's a stunning victory for the defense. I'm speechless.\"The U.S. Attorney in Oregon , Billy J. Williams, said in a statement that his office stood by its decision to prosecute the seven defendants.\"We strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a Court, publicly tried, and decided by a jury,\" the statement said. 'When the jury hears the story, I expect the same result' The Oregon case was, in a sense, an extension the tense standoff between federal officials with the BLM and other authorities, and the Bundy's two years ago in Nevada. Cliven, Ammon and Ryan Bundy are all scheduled to go on trial for that standoff early next year.It's not clear what the outcome of the Nevada trial will be. Federal attorneys have said they don't feel like the outcome in Oregon will have any effect whatsoever on the Nevada trial.But defense attorneys involved in the Nevada trial aren't so sure. Daniel Hill, an attorney for Ammon Bundy , says the Oregon acquittal bodes well for his client and the other defendants, all of whom are facing felony weapon, conspiracy and other charges, the Tribune reported.\"When the jury hears the whole story,\" he told The Associated Press , \"I expect the same result.\" Sources:", "output": "0.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: | July 10, 2016 at 4:05 pm | Reply \nMichael Flynn is more than a valued adviser to the presumptive GOP nominee. He’s also a potential VP candidate. \nThe growing chatter about his key role in the Trump campaign coincides with his new book, “The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies,” scheduled for release July 12. A vice presidential trial balloon certainly would drive interest in the text, and possibly juice sales. \nHe teamed up on the book with Michael Ledeen, a prominent member of a group of scholars and former government officials that helped shape the views of many top national security leaders in the George W. Bush administration. \nFollow us: @politico on Twitter | Politico on Facebook \nMichael Ledeen \nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \nWork in the United States[edit] \nIn the early 1980s, Ledeen appeared before the newly established Senate Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism, alongside former CIA director William Colby, author Claire Sterlingand former Newsweek editor Arnaud de Borchgrave. Both Ledeen and de Borchgrave worked for the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University at the time.[6]All four testified that they believed the Soviet Union had provided for material support, training and inspiration for various terrorist groupings.[7] Ledeen was involved in the Iran–Contra affair as a consultant of National Security Advisor Robert C. McFarlane. Ledeen vouched for Iranian intermediary Manucher Ghorbanifar. In addition, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, officials of the Israeli Foreign Ministry and the Central Intelligence Agency to arrange meetings with high-ranking Iranian officials, whereby U.S supported Iranians would be given weapons by Israel, and would proceed to negotiate with Hizbollah for the release of hostages in Lebanon.[8] Ledeen’s own version of the events is published in his book, Perilous Statecraft.[9] \nYellowcake forgery allegations[edit] \nMain article: Niger uranium forgeries \nAccording to a September 2004 article by Joshua Micah Marshall, Laura Rozen, and Paul Glastris in Washington Monthly:[10]“The first meeting occurred in Rome in December, 2001. It included Franklin, Rhode, and another American, the neoconservative writer and operative Michael Ledeen, who organized the meeting. (According to UPI, Ledeen was then working for Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith as a consultant.) Also in attendance was Ghorbanifar and a number of other Iranians.” \nColleagues Andrew McCarthy and Mark R. Levin have defended Ledeen, writing[11] \nUp until now, the fiction recklessly spewed by disgruntled intelligence-community retirees and their media enablers—some of whom have conceded that the claim is based on zero evidence—has been that Michael had something to do with the forged Italian documents that, according to the Left’s narrative, were the basis for President Bush’s “lie” in the 2003 State of the Union Address that Saddam Hussein had obtained yellowcake uranium (for nuclear-weapons construction) in Africa. \nIraq War advocacy[edit] \nRegarding the “pre-emptive” invasion of Iraq, in 2002 Ledeen criticized the views of former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, writing:[12] He fears that if we attack Iraq “I think we could have an explosion in the Middle East. It could turn the whole region into a cauldron and destroy the War on Terror.” \nOne can only hope that we turn the region into a cauldron, and faster, please. If ever there were a region that richly deserved being cauldronized, it is the Middle East today. If we wage the war effectively, we will bring down the terror regimes in Iraq, Iran, and Syria, and either bring down the Saudi monarchy or force it to abandon its global assembly line to indoctrinate young terrorists. \nThat’s our mission in the war against terror. Ledeen specifically called for the deposition of Saddam Hussein’s regime by force in 2002: So it’s good news when Scowcroft comes out against the desperately needed and long overdue war against Saddam Hussein and the rest of the terror masters.[12] and: Question #2: Okay, well if we are all so certain about the dire need to invade Iraq, then when do we do so? Ledeen: Yesterday[13] Ledeen’s statements prior to the start of the Iraq war such as “desperately needed and long overdue war against Saddam Hussein” and “dire need to invade Iraq” caused Glenn Greenwald to label his later statement that he “opposed the military invasion of Iraq before it took place” to be an “outright lie”.[14] However, Ledeen maintains these statements are consistent since: “I advocated—as I still do—support for political revolution in Iran as the logical and necessary first step in the war against the terror masters.”[15] \nViews on Iran[edit] \nAlthough Ledeen was in favor of invading Iraq, he also believes that Iran should have been the first priority in the “war on terror.”[16] The New York Times describes Ledeen’s views as “everything traces back to Tehran”.[16] Ledeen’s phrase, “faster, please” has become a signature meme in Ledeen’s writings (it is currently the title of his blog on the Pajamas Mediawebsite) and is often referenced by neoconservative writers advocating a more forceful and broader “war on terror.” In 1979, Ledeen was one of the first Western writers to argue thatAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was a “clerical fascist”, and that while it was legitimate to criticize the Shah’s regime, if Khomeini seized power in Iran the Iranian people would suffer an even greater loss of freedom and women would be deprived of political and social rights. He presently believes that “No one in the West has yet supported Iranian democratic organizations” and that “aggressive support for those Iranians who wish to be free” would most likely work in ending the clerical government.[17] \nAccording to Justin Raimondo, Ledeen “holds up Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright as patsies for Khomeini—who supposedly believed that the Ayatollah overthrew Shah Reza Pahlavibecause the Iranian government was ‘excessively repressive and intolerant.’ While it would not do to come right out and deny the savagery of the Shah’s legendary SAVAK secret police, Ledeen informs us that, under the monarch’s beneficent rule, ‘Iran had become too modern, too tolerant—especially of women and of other religious faiths—and too self-indulgent. The shah had Westernized Iran’—except, perhaps, in his prisons, where the ancient methods of torture were routinely employed on dissidents of all sorts.”[18] \nLedeen is currently against both an invasion of Iran or air-strikes within the country.[17][19] He has argued that the latter may eventually become necessary if negotiations with the Iranian government fail, but it would only be the least bad option of many options and it would lead to many negative unforeseen consequences.[19] The New York Times has called Ledeen’s skepticism towards military action against Iran surprising given his opposition to the regime.[16] In October 2007, Ledeen argued that:“Those who believe that I am part of some “hawkish gang” just haven’t noticed that I am opposed to invasion or bombing the nuclear facilities. My fear is that, by failing to promote a non-violent democratization of Iran, we make large-scale violence much more likely.” \n“In any event, time will tell, and I share the fear of most commenters [sic] that we will indeed arrive at a horrible choice between Iran with the bomb, or bomb Iran, as Sarkozy and Kouchner have put it. And if that happens, it will demonstrate a terrible failure on the part of the West, including the United States, to craft a serious Iran policy lo these many years.”[17]", "output": "0. Fake"}

It is true that if Congress sabotages this deal, there would be nothing stopping Iran from getting the bomb,  Pickering adds.  That would likely spark an arms race throughout the region.

It is a momentous day. Right-thinking  commenters and the European elite are aghast. But I couldn t be happier.In Austria, European governments see a mirror of their own future.Look long and hard my friends, because this is coming your way. A new populist politics is back in the ascendant, defending national identity and protecting the rights of true nationals from the drain of immigration. And this is just the start of things to come.Make no mistake: the author of this Europe-wide phenomenon is Merkel.She has penned a new era in history, in which Europe rejects an open-door policy to immigration which would lead to our women being the target of archaic cultures and religions, and rape being a helpless man s only response to the provocative sight of an unveiled woman.But this is more than a rejection of European immigration policy. This is individual nations asserting their right to self-govern. Peoples voting to protect their sense of self and reassert sovereignty.These nations do not want to be part of some amorphous whole, a blancmange of nonsense led by a German. And they are fighting back in city squares chanting  never again .Hofer says:  To those in Austria who go to war for Islamic State or rape women, I say to those people:  This is not your home.  I have a strong sense many of you would vote for a British leader with precisely these views.And Hofer is not alone.The Danish People s Party has 21 per cent of the vote and publicised its policy of removing valuables over the value of  1,045 from immigrants to pay for their welfare. It also placed adverts in Lebanese newspapers warning against migration to Denmark.The UK, on the other hand, advertises its benefits and accommodates migrants in hotels.In Finland the populist Right argues that true Finns take priority in social and healthcare spending.The UK prioritises immigrants for school places and council homes and gives away healthcare for free.Marine Le Pen s National Front (FN) is the biggest nationalist challenge to Europe s liberal democratic traditions. She has modernised the party and mobilised support in the face of terror attacks.It suits the Left to throw out insults and put lazy labels on these political parties, seeking to marginalise or discredit them In Germany, Greece, Italy, Hungary, Switzerland   parties which espouse the same views are also on the rise.Questioning immigration, the EU and the establishment, while promoting a strong sense of nationalist sentiment, is now entirely  salonfaehig , as German-speakers would say.Their ugly word for  passable in your living room    or, as we would say, socially acceptable.Merkel, for the record, is not salonfaehig in my home.The Swiss even use controversial black-sheep posters to make their point about immigration.But it suits the Left to throw out insults and put lazy labels on these political parties, seeking to marginalise or discredit them despite their obvious electoral success and democratic support. It calls these parties the Far Right, hoping you will close your eyes, picture a skinhead with a beer belly and an England flag tattooed on his forehead, and snigger.But remember, this breed of lazy socialists also mocked Donald Trump, and will continue to do so as he ascends the steps to the White House.They smirk, cocooned in their London bubble as will no doubt still be listening to the BBC still calling Donald Trump a buffoon even as he descend the stairs from Air Force One.Meanwhile Americans want him to speak up on their behalf. To be the voice of the people, to Make America Great Again, to halt immigration, protect their cultural identity and reassert their right to look after their own culture first.It s no coincidence Hofer and Trump both use the same slogan: America/Austria First!And these words are being echoed all around Europe. Restrict immigration, self-govern, reassert the right to put your own people first.And as I look west towards Trump in the White House, east to Hofer in Austria and Le Penn resurgent in France, north towards the Danish People s Party with the toughest immigration rules in Europe, and south to the stronghold of the Swiss People s Party   I see a political compass whose true direction is set on national identity and sovereignty.This movement is supported by people living in their cultural homeland, working hard, paying taxes, looking for someone, anyone, to speak up for their rights, their country, their future.And if Merkel continues the madness of trying to fast-track Turkey into the EU, millions more will join them.Just as if Britain has the guts to vote to leave the EU, I have no doubt citizens all over Europe will start demanding that they too get a vote.All over the Western world, multiculturalism is being rejected in favour of national identity. The surge of populist politics of the Right reflects a deeper will of the people to take back power from those who believe we are all equal. We all have rights.We are not. We do not.If you come to our country and fight for Islamic State, rape our women, and then ask Europe to defend your human rights, this is not your home.Our NHS, our schools, our local doctors  surgeries   they are not yours to monopolise either. Our children should come first.The balance of power is shifting. Raising the specter of fascism is just lazy labelling.Via: Katie Hopkins  Daily Mail", "output": "0. Fake"}

It soon bounced back but markets around the world and in the United States are nervous about what will happen as long as Trump continues to push an economic policy that significantly lowers taxes on the rich, slashes regulations, boosts spending like never before, and antagonizes American and foreign businesses.Trump s escalation of confrontations with Iran and China, along with European fear of an invasion by Russia have also left the future of the world economy in doubt.Trump has been erratic, paranoid, and quick to whine on Twitter and has shown a willingness to attack businesses that make decisions he disagrees with.And Donald Trump s unpredictability is forcing foreign investors to stop investing in United States Treasuries.According to Bloomberg,Across the world, foreigners are pulling back from U.S. debt like never before. From Tokyo to Beijing and London, the consensus is clear: few overseas investors want to step into the $13.9 trillion U.S. Treasury market right now. Whether it s the prospect of bigger deficits and more inflation under President Donald Trump or higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, the world s safest debt market seems less of a sure thing   particularly after the upswing in yields since November. And then there is Trump s penchant for saber rattling, which has made staying home that much easier.Bloomberg goes on to point out that  any consistent drop-off in foreign demand could have lasting consequences on America s ability to finance itself cheaply,  which means the cost of running the federal government could skyrocket and fall upon the shoulders of struggling working class Americans who will see their taxes rise as the wealthy escape their own responsibility for providing revenues to the government.And as Trump continues to initiate trade wars against China, Japan, and other nations, it could further justify foreign investors from investing in the United States.We could be looking at an impending economic catastrophe as long as Trump continues to make America a credit risk. He wants to double down on the failed trickle-down economic policies Republicans are obsessed with and if he repeals the Affordable Care Act, that will create further chaos as the wealthy pay less in taxes and the deficit increases. Our economy is primed to implode and foreign investors see it coming. Investing in America is too risky right now, and it is only going to get worse.

Specifically, Trump admitted that he is only interested in helping his rich friends instead of sticking to his promise to help the working class Americans who voted for him. We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank, because frankly I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses and they can t borrow money. They just can t get any money because the banks just won t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank. So we ll be talking about that in terms of the banking industry. Furthermore, Trump has stacked his administration with former Goldman Sachs employees despite criticizing Hillary Clinton throughout his campaign for her ties to the big Wall Street bank.On Sunday, Senator Bernie Sanders did not mince words as he called out Trump for being a fraud. It is hard not to laugh to see President Trump alongside these Wall Street guys,  Sanders said on CNN with Jake Tapper.  I have to say this, Jake, and I don t mean to be disrespectful. This guy is a fraud. Sander s reminded Tapper and viewers that Trump ran his campaign by promising to fight Wall Street. This guy ran for president of the United States and said,  I, Donald Trump, I m going to take on Wall Street, these guys are getting away with murder.  And then suddenly he appoints all these Wall Street billionaires, his major financial adviser comes from Goldman Sachs and now he s going to dismantle legislation that protects consumers. Indeed, Trump claimed during his campaign that he would be tough on Wall Street and would seek to restore laws that were passed after the Great Depression, like Glass-Steagall, that placed regulations on the financial sector designed to prevent the kind of banking practices that caused it in the first place and would also cause the Great Recession in 2008.Sanders also slammed Trump for appointing people who want to destroy Medicare and Social Security despite promising that he would protect both programs. This is a guy who ran for president, saying,  I m not going to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,  Sanders said.  And then he appoints all of these guys who are precisely going to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. In the end, while Sanders conceded that Trump put on a good show to dupe voters,  I think he s going to sell out the middle class and the working class of this country. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump does not care about the American people. He only cares about himself and his wealthy buddies.

We’ve seen this with Al-Qaeda, and various documents that have tied them to U.S. intelligence agencies like the CIA. We’ve also seen a lot of shady circumstances surrounding the “terrorist” attacks that occurred on 9/11; the evidence alone has approximately half of the American people believing it was an inside job – a simple Google search of the polls will show you that, and for the evidence we are referring to, you can access our articles on that topic here . “All three buildings were destroyed by carefully planned, orchestrated and executed controlled demolition.” – Professor Lynn Margulis, Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts at Amherst and National Academy of Science member, one of many academics who has been very outspoken regarding 9/11 ( source ) ( source ) All of this activity continues to be used as more justification for a heightened national security state, one in which citizens are being forced to give up their freedoms and privacy in order to be “protected” from such attacks. The entire national security state would crumble if people found out that it was their own government perpetrating these attacks, and this realization is finally beginning to leave the realm of conspiracy and enter into the realm of reality in the minds of the masses. It’s about time. “Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We’ve become a lunatic asylum.” – David Steele, a 20-year Marine Corps intelligence officer, and the second-highest-ranking civilian in the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence ( source )   The “terrorists” we are pointing our fingers at (or so I believe, along with many others, after having done careful research) are a creation of Western intelligence, used to justify the infiltration of other countries for ulterior motives. Those who usually do not believe that, almost one hundred percent of the time have not actually done any research, or examined the information for themselves. This is the power mainstream media has over us – if something is depicted on television, it’s instantly believed without question. Any other explanation which does not come from a major mainstream media outlet (like CNN, for example), or fit the framework of accepted knowledge, seems to be met with harsh resistance. This resistance comes despite the fact that a tremendous amount of evidence is available in the form of videos, documents, and whistle-blowers, yet a large majority of people still refuse to do any research for themselves, or again, believe something contrary to what Western media is telling them. “The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the ‘devil’ only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism.

STD treatments, and access to the contraception that would prevent abortions in the first place by preventing unwanted pregnancies.And that makes Republicans a bunch of evil anti-women villains who need a serious ass-kicking.During an interview with Cosmopolitan on Thursday, Johansson provided that ass-kicking by defending Planned Parenthood.She began by criticizing Republicans for focusing so much on defunding Planned Parenthood when there are so many problems in the world that need immediate attention.

{"instruction": "Task: Please determine whether the text is 0. False, 1. TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Region: Central Asia In November 2016, the Majilis of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan approved the creation of an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Low-Enriched Uranium Bank on its territory. Low-enriched uranium (LEU) is a material used for making fuel for nuclear power plants (NPP). The International Atomic Energy Agency decided to create a strategic LEU warehouse in 2006. The project’s aim is to secure an uninterrupted supply of fuel to the NPPs of the IAEA Member States. However, the Bank will not be used for regular LEU supply. This will be an emergency reserve, which will only be used in exceptional circumstances. The IAEA will own the official LEU reserves. It was decided to place the Bank in one of the Agency’s Member States. The location of choice might be a state with no nuclear weapons but with the technologies and infrastructure to work with LEU. In addition, the country should enjoy a good reputation in the IAEA. Kazakhstan complied with all these requirements. The Republic of Kazakhstan is a large-scale producer of uranium with the relevant technologies and experience, which includes processing high-enriched uranium into LEU (which is important for nuclear disarmament). Kazakhstan decided to participate in the development of peaceful atomic energy and filed an application to the IAEA in summer 2011. Kazakhstan proposed two locations for the Bank: a plot at the former Semipalatinsk test site and the Ulba Metallurgical Plant (Ust-Kamenogorsk). After inspection of both sites by the Agency’s experts, the second site was chosen. The Ulba Metallurgical Plant has almost a half a century of experience in working with radioactive materials and high-skilled experts – a legacy of the Soviet school. In addition, the enterprise has been greatly upgraded and it meets the highest safety requirements. In April 2015, a decree of the Kazakhstan Parliament approved a treaty with the IAEA on the creation of the LEU Bank in Kazakhstan. In August 2015, this Treaty was signed by the Foreign Affairs Minister of Kazakhstan Erlan Idrissov and the IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano. The preparation works involving IAEA experts are in full swing. Prior to the placement of the LEU Bank in Kazakhstan, its government will have to improve both the infrastructure and legislation in order to comply with international safety criteria. The foundation has already been laid: the law On the Use of Nuclear Power was adopted in January 2016. IAEA experts participated in the preparation of some amendments to the new law. There is a lot still to be done to make the new warehouse as safe as possible for the local citizens and the environment. All the material will be stored in containers that comply with European standards. According to IAEA data, the uranium reserves will be enough to provide electricity to a big city for 3 years. The IAEA will bear all the expenses related to uranium transportation, taxes, and guarantees in respect of the LEU Bank. Kazakhstan will have to run the warehouse at its own expense – provide it with electricity, pay salaries to the employees (citizens of Kazakhstan), etc. In acknowledgement of the placement and maintenance of the LEU Bank on its territory, Kazakhstan expects that the IAEA will assist it in the development of the nuclear industry. Right now, the IAEA Commission is working in Kazakhstan and conducting general research of the nuclear infrastructure. Upon completion of its work, the Commission will prepare a report with recommendations for the development of Kazakhstan’s nuclear industry. The Republic possesses huge reserves of uranium and ranks first in the world in terms of its production. Uranium from Kazakhstan forms a large part of the world uranium market. Moreover, Kazakhstan has long dreamed of supplying more than just raw materials or semi-finished products to other countries. It hopes to independently carry out all the stages of the nuclear fuel cycle right up to uranium conversion into nuclear fuel for the nuclear power plants. The export of nuclear fuel is greatly more profitable. The President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev mentioned this objective during a meeting with the Chairman of the Board of Kazatomprom Askar Zhumagaliyev that took place in early November 2016. He noted that to reach this goal, Kazakhstan should intensify cooperation with other states and international organizations in the nuclear industry. It should be noted that one of the major partners of Kazakhstan in the nuclear industry is Russia. Owing to its interaction with Russia, Kazakhstan has made progress in the independent production of nuclear fuel. This cooperation continues: in October 2016, Astana hosted the Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum with the participation of the Presidents of the two countries – Vladimir Putin and Nursultan Nazarbayev. As a result, Russia and Kazakhstan adopted a plan of collaboration until 2018 and signed a Memorandum on expanding strategic partnership in the field of the nuclear fuel cycle. The Memorandum confirms all the previous agreements between the two countries in respect of the collaboration in the nuclear industry, including uranium production and processing. In addition, the document mentions the opportunity of Russia and Kazakhstan’s mutual participation in IAEA projects. The placement of the LEU Bank in the territory of the Republic is a grand gesture towards the IAEA, which will raise the profile of Kazakhstan in the eyes of other states. The LEU bank will prevent existing nuclear reactors from experiencing fuel deficit and it will promote the non-proliferation of the nuclear weapons. In fact, countries wishing to develop peaceful atomic energy often have to enrich uranium on their own in order to make fuel from it. Meanwhile, the IAEA fears that some of them may exceed the enrichment level for peaceful purposes and obtain material for the creation of nuclear weapons. The LEU Bank, which any of the IAEA Member States may turn to, will mean they no longer have to enrich uranium independently thus reducing the threat of the nuclear weapon proliferation. Thus, Kazakhstan may become a strategically important member of the IAEA and participate in ensuring global security. Apart from a reputation boost and assistance in the nuclear projects, this may attract the attention of foreign investors. According to the government of Kazakhstan, the volume of foreign investment in the country’s economy increased 5 times in the first half of 2016 and amounted to almost 6 billion US dollars. This growth is undoubtedly linked to Kazakhstan’s improved international standing, which has partially resulted from its cooperation with the IAEA.

For the time being, Hillary Clinton has a slight advantage over her rival in the race, Republican candidate Donald Trump . In electoral votes, Clinton has 259 vs. Trump's 164 votes (270 votes are required for victory). It will be up to six doubting states to decide the outcome of the presidential election - Utah, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Florida and Ohio. Many experts believe that Trump will win the vote. Will he? First off, the United States is fed up with Obama and the Democrats, and it could be very well seen in the mid-term elections for Congress in 2014, when Democrats lost seven states and gave the vast majority of Congress seats to Republicans. The outgoing president had given many eloquent promises, but has not been able to keep them. Hillary Clinton is the successor of the dubious legacy of Barack Obama. She was part of Obama's government during his first four years as Secretary of State. The infamous Islamic State terrorist organization (banned in Russia) appeared during her stay in power. It was during Clinton's stay in power, when Putin started winning in the game against the USA, when the US Ambassador in Benghazi was killed and when the devastating Arab Spring started gathering pace.

She used her private email for officials messages, which is strictly forbidden in the USA. The FBI resumed investigation into the case a week before the election, having caused irreparable damage to Clinton's rating. Thirdly, a lot will depend on the turnout.

Whose crazed fans are going to be up at 5 AM on Election Day, kicking ass all day long, all the way until the last polling place has closed, making sure every Tom, Dick and Harry (and Bob and Joe and Billy Bob and Billy Joe and Billy Bob Joe) has cast his ballot? That's right..\" US film director Michael Moore wrote. Fourth, Trump personifies the American dream in real life. Donald Trump has made his name himself. Hillary Clinton amassed her fortune when in public service and lecturing Wall Street bankers. Trump's program says what the American people want to hear. The program raises such relevant issues as job losses, terrorist threat, immigration problems. Angry white Americans do not like the fact that various minorities in their country act as if they are a majority. Trump represents the conservative America. Therefore, immigration law, abortion ban, protection of military veterans, the revival of industry - these issues worry most Americans, especially those who go to church on Sundays and honor the commandments. Fifth, the Americans may vote contrary to propaganda. A man approached Michael Moore after a show, the director wrote in his article. \"Coming back to the hotel after appearing on Bill Maher's Republican Convention special this week on HBO, a man stopped me. \"Mike,\" he said, \"we have to vote for Trump. We HAVE to shake things up.\" That was it. That was enough for him. To \"shake things up,\" Michael Moore wrote.

Trump does not use anything but Twitter and meetings with electors in his election campaign, but he is still very close to Hillary Clinton. \"I think that Trump has very good chances to win. In fact, he has already left Clinton behind,\" Oleg Soskin, Ukrainian politician, economist and political scientist told Pravda.Ru. In this case, the expert believes, major geopolitical, geo-economic and strategic changes will take place as Trump's victory will bring in completely new people, forces, organizations, structures, systems, etc. For Ukraine, Trump's victory woud mark a political death for Poroshenko and his team. Germany and France will experience major changes as well, while the Baltic States will find themsleves in a difficult situation, because they completely depend on the United States. Tectonic changes will occur inside NATO as well,\" Oleg Soskin said. \"Clinton, if she wins, will protect the interests of global financial capital,\" Dmitry Mosyakov, the head of the Center for Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania at the Institute of Oriental Studies, Doctor of Historical Sciences, told Pravda.Ru. - Trump's coming to power will entail serious changes for East Asia and the Pacific region. Trump says that America should pursue its own interests in the first place in both political and economic fields. I think that Trump will win, if the election is held honestly. He says truly Republican things to revive America's own businesses,\" the expert told Pravda.Ru. Also read: Donald Trump and the genius of idiocy \"The things that we can see happening in the USA now confirm my long-standing assumption of significant divisions of elites in the country,\" Karine Gevorgyan, a political scientist, expert on Iran, orientalist told Pravda.Ru. \"The hegemonic role of the United States has led to chaos both in domestic and foreign policies. Therefore, a serious split inside the administration may aggravate further no matter who eventually takes office as president,\" the expert added. Lyuba Lulko", "output": "0. Fake"}

As they make their way across Europe, police forces find themselves ill-equipped to handle the extreme increase in sexual assault and violence, so citizens are now finding themselves in a position where they are being forced to take matters into their own hands.A group of young concerned Germans made a video warning that they would no longer sit back and watch their culture and history being destroyed. The video can be viewed by clicking HERE.On February 4, 2015, we reported about a fast growing group of vigilantes who call themselves the  Soldiers of Odin. The self-styled  Soldiers of Odin  march in a mob, wearing bomber jackets with their logo on the back. They have vowed to take direct action to  protect their wives, girlfriends and children  after a migrant influx to the liberal Scandinavian country. Persons linked to Islamist groups in Oslo say that they have formed a group called  Soldiers of Allah .Via a central source in the Islamist environment, the Norwegian newspaper VG has received a statement, and photographs of the planned uniform.The group has been named  Jundullaah    which translates to  Soldiers of Allah . In response to the group of unbelievers in Soldiers of Odin, who are patrolling the streets, we Muslims have chosen to create a group to patrol the streets, initially in the capital Oslo, to forbid evil and call for the good,  says the statement.The planned  uniform , is decorated with the black flag of the terrorist organization Islamic State (IS) on the back, with a small logo on the chest.On Tuesday, Labour s Muslim deputy chairman, Hadia Tajik, said that the Soldiers of Odin defy Norway s rules on private security businesses and she tried to illustrate the problem as follows:  It is as if the Islamists would be the uniformed ones, take to the streets and call themselves guards or vigilantes. It is very undesirable and unfortunate for our country, devastating, said Tajik.Now it s exactly what is about to happen.Great tip, Tajik.The information that Islamists in Oslo are in the process of establishing a group, is also confirmed by the temporary spokesman of the Prophet s ummah who calls himself  Abu Arijon.  He said that the plan is to start in Oslo, then Drammen and T nsberg.Many of the people in  Soldiers of Allah  come from the environment around the Islamist group the Prophet s Ummah, where spokesman Ubaydullah Hussain currently is in custody and charged with recruiting for IS. Soldiers of Allah  inform in the statement themselves, that almost everyone in the group is on the  Watch List  of the Police Security Service (PST).  Is PST aware of the group  Soldiers of Allah  planning to patrol in Oslo?  We can not comment on individuals or individual groups, says senior adviser in PST, Siv Als n, to VG.So there it is. Regular street battles could soon be a reality in Norway. Soldiers of Odin against Soldiers of Allah, with the police in between. However, it will most likely not be started by the Soldiers of Odin, but the rabid Islamists in the soldiers of Allah. And then, even though the Soldiers of Odin claim to be a peaceful group, the Viking has clearly awaken   illustrated by the logo on the back. And being attacked by Islamists, they will have no other choice than to go berserk again, after a thousand years in hibernation.All hell is breaking loose in countries all across Europe. Are Americans paying attention, or has Obama s manufactured race war distracted us from his plan to seed Muslims in our small towns and communities across America through the US State Dept.

Apparently Yglesias agrees with this sentiment: Matt Yglesias deleted something like 30,000 tweets yesterday. Clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations. \nFortunately, the Internet is forever and all of the stupid things that Yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly. \nHere are 11 things Yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb. \n1. Yglesias was convinced that people would love Obamacare. That is, until he didn't: . @mattyglesias Obamacare marker - which was solid as of 15 minutes ago - appears to no longer be markering pic.twitter.com/a0EyXImI8g — Omri Ceren (@cerenomri) October 26, 2016 \nHis 2013 piece is still available though, and in it he whines about how supposedly \"the media, for non-ideological reasons, is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing.\" Yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that \"when Obamacare becomes the status quo, people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten.\" \nIn other words, Yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking. That all fell by the wayside when the Obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of 25 percent. \n2. Yglesias made a racist comment toward former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R). In a 2013 tweet that is now deleted, Yglesias wrote, \"Is Bobby Jindal’s reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping?\" \nYglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash, tweeting: \"Oh, fun. Conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode.\" \nEventually, Yglesias backed down, tweeting: \"For the record, now that I know more about Jindal’s life it’s clear that he’s a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff.\" \nThe irony of Yglesias saying this was not lost on Twitter: Good thing you don't say dumb stuff. MT @mattyglesias It’s clear that Jindal’s a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff. — jon gabriel (@exjon) June 18, 2013 \n3. Yglesias once ranted against \"dumb Jewish politicians.\" The leftist pundit wrote a ThinkProgress piece in 2009 that was seriously titled \"Dumb Jewish Politicians,\" in which Yglesias highlighted a passage from Jonathan Chait, who wrote in the New Republic that then-Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) had to be stupid for not supporting the public option. \n\"I suspect that Lieberman is the beneficiary, or possibly the victim, of a cultural stereotype that Jews are smart and good with numbers,\" Chait wrote. \"Trust me, it’s not true. If Senator Smith from Idaho was angering Democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes, most liberals would deride him as an idiot. With Lieberman, we all suspect it’s part of a plan. I think he just has no idea what he’s talking about and doesn’t care to learn\" \nYglesias agreed: \nI’ve long held a related theory about Eric Cantor. \nAnyways, this reminds me that at a meeting this morning I pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret Christmas morning session that only Jewish Senators would attend. There’s a whole bunch — Boxer, Cardin, Feingold, Feinstein, Franken, Kohl, Lautenberg, Levin, Lieberman, Sanders, Schumer, Specter, and Wyden. It’s a very progressive bunch and Lieberman could easily be outvoted \n4. Yglesias advocated for ending time zones. Seriously. In what was a typical example of Vox being a waste of space, Yglesias wrote a 2014 piece titled \"The case against time zones: They're impractical & outdated.\" Yglesias pontificated: \nNorthern Idaho is connected via I-90 to Spokane and Seattle to its west, but not to Boise to its south so the Couer d'Alene area is on Pacific Time rather than Mountain Time. India has broken with the general scheme and adopted a half-hour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time. \nYet while these zig-zags and 30-minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time, they serve a very practical purpose. It is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings, calls, and other arrangements across time zones. The need to constantly specify which time zone you're talking about is a drag. Commuting across time zones would be more annoying still, which is why the suburbs of Chicago that are located in Indiana use Illinois' Central Time rather than Indianapolis' Eastern Time. \nBut the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations. It's to shift the world to one giant time zone. \nYgleasias then called for \"One time to rule them all\"–a phrase that prompted J.R.R. Tolkien to weep in his grave–and then wrote this doozy: \nIf the whole world used a single GMT-based time, schedules would still vary. In general most people would sleep when it's dark out and work when it's light out. So at 23:00, most of London would be at home or in bed and most of Los Angeles would be at the office. But of course London's bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in LA would be grabbing a nap. The difference from today is that if you were putting together a London-LA conference call at 21:00 there'd be only one possible interpretation of the proposal. A flight that leaves New York at 14:00 and lands in Paris at 20:00 is a six-hour flight, with no need to keep track of time zones. If your appointment is in El Paso at 11:30 you don't need to remember that it's in a different time zone than the rest of Texas. \nPejman Yousefzadeh explained just how stupid Yglesias's time zone piece was, writing at Ricochet : \"I grant you that there are times when confusion does take place, but seriously, who cares? Is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that Matthew Yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them? Don’t the people at Vox have anything better to write about?\" \nApparently they don't. \n5. Yglesias doesn't understand Florida's geography very well. Yglesias wrote a short blurb in The Atlantic in 2007, in which he began thinking aloud about the city of Miami. \n\"I'd been interested to know what, if anything, is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know,\" Yglesias said. \nPeople immediately pointed the obvious answer: Miami couldn't do so because there was this thing called a swamp–most of which is The Everglades National Park–causing such development to be difficult to accomplish. \n\"Yes, yes, commenters I know it's a freaking swamp but there's plenty of development on ex-swampland in Florida -- hence all the canals and weird-looking lakes,\" an exasperated Yglesias wrote in an update. \nExcept that the land is not \"ex-swampland,\" it's an actual swamp . Maybe Yglesias shouldn't write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud. \n6. Yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fine...if you're a politician. Yglesias found himself getting smacked around on Twitter after he advocated for high-speed rail advocates to provide an \"unrealistically optimistic\" projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government. \n\"For better or for worse, that’s politics,\" Yglesias wrote at ThinkProgress . \nOn Twitter, Yglesias attempted to justify it by writing: \"Fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do, yes.\" \nAnd yet, Yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist Eli Lake of being dishonest on Twitter. \nYglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a Catch-22 when he told the Daily Caller to \"go f*** yourself\" when they tried to interview him about the Twitter incident. \n7. Yglesias once hailed the Department of Veteran Affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate. The Federalist 's Sean Davis pointed to Yglesias writing in 2009 that the VA was \"producing the highest quality care in the country. Their turnaround points the way toward solving America’s health-care crisis.\" Yglesias also tweeted at GOP chairman Reince Priebus in 2013, \"Will @Reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans?\" This tweet was also deleted, and for good reason, since the VA has caused 307,000 veteran deaths due to \"systemic\" problems with the agency. \n8. Yglesias doesn't understand the purpose of the Senate. Yglesias wrote the following for ThinkProgress in 2009, per the Guardian : \nIf you add together the two Republican Senators from Wyoming with the one from Alaska, one from South Dakota, one from New Hampshire, two from Maine, two from Idaho, two from Nebraska, one from Nevada, two from Utah, two from Kansas, two from Mississippi, one from Iowa, two from Oklahoma, two from Kentucky, one from Louisiana, two from South Carolina, and two from Alabama, the 28 of them collectively represent (on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator) 11.98 percent of the American population. Meanwhile, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein together represent 11.95 percent of the American population. \nNow of course Texas is also a big state (though at 7.81 percent of the population it's a lot smaller than California) and there are small states (like Vermont and North Dakota) that have two Democratic Senators. So the point here isn't a narrowly partisan one, though the wacky apportionment of the Senate does have a partisan valence. The point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things. If you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population, we have just 34 Senators representing the above-average states even though they collectively contain 69.15 percent of the population. The other 66 Senators represent about 30 percent of the people. If the Iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution, nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them. \nIn three paragraphs of rambling, incoherent nonsense, Yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations. \n9. Yglesias doesn't understand America's financial system. Yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a 2013 Slate column that there were \"far far far too many banks\" in the country, as there were 6,891 at the time. Yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous: \n1. They are poorly managed: You know how the best and brightest of Wall Street royally screw up sometimes? This doesn't get better when you drill down to the less-bright and not-as-good guys. It gets worse. And since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from FDIC-ensured depositors, nobody is watching the store. In effect, the well-managed banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones. The dubious decision-making doesn't get as complicated as what you see on Wall Street—it's mostly just classic boom-and-bust pro-cyclical commercial real estate loans—but it creates all the same problems. 2. They can't be regulated: Since these banks are so small, they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs. So since American public policy is perversely committed to preserving them, small banks regularly get various kinds of carve-outs from regulations. And once the carve-outs exist, they create pressure for extension further up the food chain. Other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation. 3. They can't compete: If you want the JPMorgan Chases and Bank of Americas of the world to be held to account, you need both regulation and competition. But a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesn't offer any real competition. Having a large share of America's banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize big-time finance. \nDavis debunked Yglesias's argument, which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there haven't been any new banks formed in recent years (there were at least four in 2013.) \n\"Yglesias' arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anti-community bank talking points promoted by the big banks ('You guys, the Wall Street banks that nearly destroyed America aren’t the problem. Small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem. Don’t worry about the facts. Just go with it.'),\" Davis wrote in The Federalist . \"I'm actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation.\" \n10. Yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon. After reading a review of a Booker T. Washington biography, Yglesias started thinking about \"'black conservative' political tradition,\" prompting him to write in a 2009 ThinkProgress post, \"It's only extremely recently that the idea of an African-American aligning himself, à la Clarence Thomas, with the mainstream conservative movement in America could be remotely possible. But even so, that didn’t mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didn’t exist.\" \nThis is patently false, as Damon Root explained in Reason : \nActually, the great Harlem Renaissance author and journalist George Schuyler—who was known as the “black H.L. Mencken”—published “general rightist sentiments” long before Clarence Thomas came on the scene, including Schuyler’s unambiguously titled 1966 autobiography Black and Conservative. And the celebrated novelist and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston both endorsed conservative Sen. Robert A. Taft in the 1952 presidential election and repeatedly attacked FDR’s New Deal... \n11. Yglesias expressed joy when Andrew Breitbart died. Following Breitbart's death, Yglesias tweeted : \"Conventions around dead people are ridiculous. The world outlook is slightly improved with @AndrewBrietbart [sic] dead.\" \nThis tweet has also been deleted, and for good reason–celebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid, it's ghoulish, vile and reprehensible. And Slate defended Yglesias, stating that he \"is a very passionate journalist and Slate values that passion.\" \nApparently Slate believes that \"passion\" trumps basic human decency and a reasonable IQ level, and Yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities.", "output": "0.

One such moment occurred earlier this month when a Times science editor assigned science reporter Carl Zimmer to look into the mysterious illnesses affecting U.S. diplomats in the recently reopened U.S. embassy in Cuba.About two dozen U.S. diplomats supposedly were suffering hearing loss and cognitive difficulties due to what has been labeled a  sonic attack.  The Trump administration blamed the Cuban government even though the Cubans claimed to be mystified and would seem to have little motive for disrupting a long-sought d tente with Washington along with the expected boon to their tourist industry. President Trump  retaliated  by expelling 15 Cuban diplomats.Zimmer recounted the background to his story in a reporter s notebook piece on Oct. 6:  On Tuesday, Michael Mason, my editor on the science desk, shot me an email. Would I consider writing an article about  this sonic  attack  business ? I knew exactly what he was talking about. I had been vaguely puzzled about this business for months. Checking Out the StoryZimmer then did what professional journalists are supposed to do: he started contacting impartial experts to get their assessments of what was possible, what was likely, and what didn t make sense. I decided to try to find something out   not as a political reporter but as a science writer,  Zimmer wrote in the sidebar that accompanied his news article.  I usually base my ideas on scientific research that has matured far enough that it is beginning to get published in peer-reviewed journals.   I knew that an article on sonic weapons would be very different from the ones I usually write. I learned there was not even an official medical report. I decided to try to draw some boundary lines for all the speculation swirling around the story. Is the idea of a sonic attack plausible, based on what scientists know about sound and the human body?  So I hit the phone. I didn t want to talk with just anyone   I looked for people with lots of experience in research that had direct bearing on this question. I started with Timothy Leighton, whose job title at Southampton University is, literally, professor of ultrasonics and underwater acoustics. Better yet, Dr. Leighton has published the only thorough recent scientific review of the effects of environmental ultrasound that I m aware of. When I interviewed Dr. Leighton and others, I made clear I didn t expect them to solve this mystery; I just wanted them to reconcile the question with what we know through science.  The consensus was that it was extremely unlikely the diplomats were the victims of a sonic weapon. It would be necessary to rule out less exotic possibilities before taking that one seriously. Yet, despite this skeptical scientific consensus among experts, Zimmer noted,  The notion [of a sonic attack] has ricocheted like mad around the press, making it possible for readers to assume that [the sonic attack explanation] has been generally accepted by experts. But it most certainly has not. I ll be curious to see if articles like mine can put the brakes on the speculation. Suspecting PutinWell, Zimmer could have read the Times editorial in the same day s (Oct. 6) newspaper for a partial answer. While critical of the Trump administration for rushing to judgment in blaming the Cuban government and expelling 15 diplomats, the editorial concluded:  The sonic attacks on Americans are too serious to be used for cynical political ends. So much for the editorial writers reading their own newspaper, but clearly they were driven by a higher agenda. A New York Times editorial about some unpleasant topic anywhere in the world these days wouldn t be complete without taking the opportunity to blame Russia or, in this case, at least suggest Russia as a possible villain in the mystery.The Times wrote:  Other parties, most notably Russia, must also figure as suspects: President Vladimir Putin would probably welcome a setback to American-Cuban relations. Yes, every possible conspiracy theory must somehow circle back to Vladimir Putin, a real-life Dr. Evil. When he is not plotting how to flood Facebook with images of puppies or manipulate Americans in their pursuit of Pokemon Go characters, he is building secret sonic weapons to disorient U.S. diplomats in Havana and provoke President Trump to act rashly (when we all know how cool and collected Trump normally is) Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE ABOUT MSM REPORTING AT: 21st Century Wire Media Cog FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV", "output": "0.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: A close aide to Bill Clinton said he arranged for $50 million in payments for the former president, part of a complicated mingling of lucrative business deals and charity work of the Clinton Foundation mapped out in a memo released by WikiLeaks on Wednesday.The report was written by Doug Band, who has transitioned from his job as a Clinton aide to a partner in Teneo Consulting, a company whose client roster now includes some of the biggest companies in the world. Along the way, Band wrote, he also pushed his clients and contacts to donate millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation, and to help win business deals for Bill Clinton.Band wrote the memo in November 2011 to John Podesta, now chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, and sent copies to other key Clinton aides, apparently to explain and justify his work in the face of criticism from others in the Clinton orbit   notably Chelsea Clinton.WikiLeaks has been releasing thousands of hacked emails from Podesta s account in recent weeks, revealing the rivalries and controversies roiling inside the Clinton family network as Hillary Clinton prepared to run for president.In the memo, Band depicts himself as the indispensable linchpin of the Clinton family s finances even as he acknowledges that the arrangement is unusual:  We appreciate the unorthodox nature of our roles,  Band wrote.A spokesman for the Clinton campaign declined to comment; the campaign has refused to confirm whether the emails are authentic. Band did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In the November 2011 memo, Band lays out how he founded Teneo five months earlier with Declan Kelly, one of Hillary Clinton s top fundraisers during her 2008 presidential campaign. When Clinton became secretary of State, Kelly was named an envoy to Northern Ireland, holding the post even as he continued to represent several clients. Rightly or wrongly,  Band said, because other fundraisers couldn t deliver, he and Kelly pushed their clients to donate to the foundation; he also lined up speaking and consulting deals for Bill Clinton. In some cases, it worked the other way, with Teneo winning consulting contracts from foundation donors.One example, he said, was Laureate International University, the for-profit international school that donated more than $1.4 million to the Clinton Foundation and was paying Bill Clinton $3.5 million a year to serve as  honorary chancellor. The company paid Clinton more than $17 million before the relationship ended last year, as Hillary Clinton was launching her presidential bid.Read more: Detroit News", "output": "0. Fake"}

In order to save the mega-banks balance sheets from their irresponsible behavior, the Fed has denied retirees any interest income on their savings for eight years, forcing the elderly to draw down their savings, leaving their heirs, who have been displaced from employment by corporate jobs offshoring, penniless.\nThe military/security complex which has spent trillions of our taxpayer dollars on 15 years of gratuitous wars based entirely on lies in order to enrich themselves and their power.\nThe neoconservartives whose crazed ideology of US world hegemony thrusts the American people into military conflict with Russia and China.\nThe US global corporations that sent American jobs to China and India and elsewhere in order to enrich the One Percent with higher profits from lower labor costs.\nAgribusiness (Monsanto et.al.), corporations that poison the soil, the water, the oceans, and our food with their GMOs, hebicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, while killing the bees that pollinate the crops.\nThe extractive industriesenergy, mining, fracking, and timberthat maximize their profits by destroying the environment and the water supply.\nThe Israel Lobby that controls US Middle East policy and is committing genocide against the Palestinians just as the US committed genocide against native Americans. Israel is using the US to eliminate sovereign countries that stand in Israells way.\nWhat convinces me that the Oligarchy intends to steal the election is the vast difference between the presstitutes reporting and the facts on the ground.\nAccording to the presstitutes, Hillary is so far ahead that there is no point in Trump supporters bothering to vote. Hillary has won the election before the vote. Hillary has been declared a 93% sure winner.\nI am yet to see one Hillary yard sign, but Trump signs are everywhere. Reports I receive are that Hillarys public appearances are unattended but Trumps are so heavily attended that people have to be turned away. This is a report from a woman in Florida:\nTrump has pulled huge numbers all over FL while campaigning here this week. I only see Trump signs and stickers in my wide travels. I dined at a Mexican restaurant last night. Two women my age sitting behind me were talking about how they had tried to see Trump when he came to Tallahassee. They left work early, arriving at the venue at 4:00 for a 6:00 rally. The place was already over capacity so they were turned away. It turned out that there were so many people there by 2:00 that the doors had to be opened to them. The women said that the crowds present were a mix of races and ages.\nI know the person who gave me this report and have no doubt whatsoever as to its veracity.\nI also receive from readers similiar reports from around the country.\nThis is how the theft of the election is supposed to work: The media concentrated in a few corporate hands has gone all out to convince not only Americans but also the world, that Donald Trump is such an unacceptable candidate that he has lost the election before the vote.\nBy controllng the explanation, when the election is stolen those who challenge the stolen election are without a foundartion in the media. All media reports will say that it was a run away victory for Hillary over the misogynist immigrant-hating Trump.\nAnd liberal, progressive opinion will be relieved and off guard as Hillary takes us into nuclear war.\nThat the Oligarchy intends to steal the election from the American people is verified by the officially reported behavior of the voting machines in early voting in Texas. The NPR presstitutes have declared that Hillary is such a favorite that even Republican Texas is up for grabs in the election.\nIf this is the case, why was it necessary for the voting machines to be programmed to change Trump votes to Hillary votes? Those voters who noted that they voted Trump but were recorded Hillary complained. The election officials, claiming a glitch (which only went one way), changed to paper ballots. But who will count them? No glitches caused Hillary votes to go to Trump, only Trump votes to go to Hillary.\nThe most brilliant movie of our time was The Matrix. This movie captured the life of Americans manipulated by a false reality, only in the real America there is insufficient awareness and no Neo, except possibly Donald Trump, to challenge the system. Americans of all stripesacademics, scholars, journalists, Republicans, Democrats, right-wing, left-wing, US Representatives, US Senators, Presidents, corporate moguls and brainwashed Americans and foreignerslive in a false reality.\nIn the United States today a critical presidential election is in process in which not a single important issue is addressed by Hillary and the presstitutes. This is total failure. Democracy, once the hope of the world, has totally failed in the United States of America. Trump is correct. The American people must restore the accountability of government to the people.\n Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of the Wall Street Journal. He was columnist for Business Week, Scripps Howard News Service, and Creators Syndicate. He has had many university appointments. His internet columns have attracted a worldwide following.

After the young man, Elias Farah, shut the affair down, Wozniak began sexually harassing him. She also make his job a living hell, and kept him from attending and participating in events. After all of this came to light, a panel committee consisting of both Republicans and Democrats was formed to address this grossly and obviously improper conduct. Ultimately, it was decided that Wozniak was guilty of incredibly poor judgment  in conducting this affair and her behavior after it was over. There was, however, no way to prove on a legal level that Wozniak created a  hostile work environment  or sexually harassed Farah.Despite the lack of legal evidence, though, the investigating committee is now going to look into Wozniak s office every six months going forward. Also, her attempts to go after her accuser have luckily backfired, as she ironically ran for office after a Democratic opponent, Dennis Gabryszak, resigned over his own sexual scandal. A potential November Democratic opponent, sums up Wozniak s hypocritical behavior perfectly: She ran on a platform of family values based on the conduct of her predecessor.

If you haven t been following this crazy series of events, we ve got a previous report below to fill you in.

The Daily Caller just exclusively reported that Awan attempted to destroy hard drives then desperately tried to retrieve them when they were discovered.GETTING THOSE DESTROYED HARD RIVES BACK:Pakistani-born Imran Awan, long-time right-hand IT aide to the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairwoman, has since desperately tried to get the hard drives back, the individual told The Daily Caller News Foundation s Investigative Group.A high-level congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the probe, confirmed that the FBI has joined what Politico previously described as a Capitol Police criminal probe into  serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network  by Imran and three of his relatives, who had access to the emails and files of the more than two dozen House Democrats who employed them on a part-time basis.Capitol Police have also seized computer equipment tied to the Florida lawmaker.Awan s younger brothers, Abid and Jamal, his wife, Hina Alvi, and Rao Abbas, Imran s best friend, are also under investigation. There have been no arrests in the case.THIS CASE IS HUGE! MARIA BARTIROMO IS LIVID ABOUT IT:A Pakistani family under criminal investigation by the U.S. Capitol Police (see our previous report below) for abusing their access to the House of Representatives information technology (IT) system may have engaged in myriad other questionable schemes besides allegedly placing  ghost employees  on the congressional payroll.Imran Awan, his wife Hina, and brothers Abid and Jamal collectively netted more than $4 million in salary as IT administrators for House Democrats between 2009 and 2017. Yet the absence of signs of wealth displayed among them raise questions such as was the money sent overseas or did something other than paychecks motivate their actions?Capitol Police revoked the Awans  access to the congressional IT system in February 2017 after a major data breach was detected. Their access had allowed them to read emails and files of dozens of members, including many serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS   THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS IGNORING THE CRIMINALITY OF THESE BROTHERS:3 MUSLIM BROTHERS Working For Dems In Congress CAUGHT Accessing Unauthorized Top-Secret Government Intel One Has Criminal Background May Have Ties To Muslim Brotherhood [VIDEO]3 Congressional IT employees have been fired for accessing members computer networks without permission.

They were barred from computer networks at the House of Representatives on Thursday because they accessed Congressmen and Congress people s computer networks unauthorized. At a minimum they were fired. At a minimum we know that they accessed computers unauthorized and they did so in foreign intelligence, foreign affairs and intelligence committees.  Okay? So they were getting very important information, government information. They accessed these computers. That is the least of it. There s also some talk that people are looking into what ties they have into terrorism. Are they impacted by the Muslim Brotherhood? Are they a part of the Muslim Brotherhood? One of them has a criminal background!How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one?

They are thinking that they may be also one of the reasons Debbie Wasserman Schultz got hacked. There s so much more to come on this Stuart, it s an incredible story. I think it s amazing!Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Their salaries and time were shared among dozens of Democratic members, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.Chiefs of staff for dozens of Democratic lawmakers who employed the four were informed last week that a criminal probe was underway into their use of congressional information technology systems, including the existence of an external server to which House data was being funneled, and into the theft of and overbilling for computer equipment.Despite the generous salaries, the four were involved in multiple suspicious mortgage transfers and a debt-evading bankruptcy. Abid had more than $1 million in debts following a failed business called Cars International that he ran in Falls Church, Va., from November 2009 to September 2010. Business associates said in court documents that Abid had stolen money and vehicles from them.It s unclear how Abid found time to run an automotive business while working full-time for Congress. He had been on the congressional payroll since 2005. A congressional credit union repossessed two of his personal cars before the business folded.Abid filed for bankruptcy in 2012, but somehow managed to keep ownership of two houses while telling the bankruptcy court and creditors that he had no assets with which to pay them. He signed a sworn statement that he and his wife, Natalia Soba, were living apart and needed separate residences. My spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purpose of evading the requirements of   707(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code,  Abid claimed in bankruptcy documents. But both houses had been in the family for years.Abid s record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day.A spokesman for Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas told TheDCNF Friday that Jamal s  employment with our office has been terminated. Hilarie Chambers, a spokeswoman for Rep. Sandy Levin   who employed Abid   told TheDCNF that  after being notified by the House Administration Committee, this individual was removed from our payroll. We are confident that everything in our office is secure. Not every Democrat is willing to terminate their connection with these four:Some Democrats have not terminated their connection with the four, including Wasserman Schultz, who employs Imran and who resigned from her DNC post last year after a computer hack revealed embarassing emails.

{"instruction": "Task: Please determine whether the text is 0. False, 1. TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: By wmw_admin on November 2, 2016 Jared Taylor — The Unz Review Oct 28, 2016 From the start of Donald Trump’s campaign, the media have covered him dishonestly. They have consistently portrayed him as a closet “ white supremacist ” who deliberately appeals to “ racists .” They have tried to tie him to a wicked movement known as the “ Alt-Right .” They are now working on another dishonest angle: that Donald Trump is “mainstreaming hate” and bringing “racism” into public discourse. The media clearly want to stampede voters into Mrs. Clinton’s camp so as to spare us the agony of a “racist” in the White House. The demonization campaign has backfired. By trying to hang racial dissidents around Donald Trump’s neck , the media have given American Renaissance and other organizations far more publicity than ever before. At the same time, c onstant shouts of “racist” and “bigot” don’t seem to hurt Mr. Trump: instead they are wrecking what is left of media credibility. The biggest irony, though, is that Donald Trump is probably not one of us at all. But even small deviations from the cast-iron orthodoxy of race are enough to plunge our rulers into dark fantasies about Donald Trump as a secret David Duke fan. Media dishonesty started immediately. When Mr. Trump pointed out that some immigrants from Mexico were criminals , the press acted as if he had said all Mexican immigrants are criminals. Then, when alert news hounds discovered that those of us they love to call “haters” and “white supremacists” liked Mr. Trump, there was no end of articles with titles such as : “ Meet the Horde of Neo-Nazis, Klansmen, and Other Extremist Leaders Endorsing Donald Trump ,” “ Top Racists And Neo-Nazis Back Donald Trump ,” “ ‘Heil Donald Trump’: Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists Show Support ,” and “ The White Nationalists Who Support Donald Trump .” These articles had a simpleminded purpose: discredit Mr. Trump by parading before the reader any Nazi, Kluxer, or racially conscious white person who had anything nice to say about the candidate. The implication was that if “racists” were going to vote for Donald Trump he must be “racist,” too . This was deceitful and one-sided. When the chairman of the American Communist Party endorsed Hillary Clinton , no one suggested this meant she was a communist . It is true that Mr. Trump gave the media just enough of an excuse to pretend he really is a closet “bigot” because he did not repudiate “racists” with the snorts of indignation respectability requires. There was the famous exchange in February when a reporter pushed Mr. Trump to disavow an endorsement from David Duke. As The Hill reported it: “ ‘David Duke endorsed me? OK, alright. I disavow, OK?’ Trump said, seeking to quickly move on to another question.” That same month, there was another famous exchange with Jake Tapper of CNN : Tapper: Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don’t want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election? Donald Trump: Well just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don’t know. I don’t know, did he endorse me, or what’s going on? Because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. The media leaped on these exchanges with shouts of joy . “Trump refuses to disavow white supremacists! That’s because he is one!” There are far better explanations. First, Donald Trump is a pugnacious man. He doesn’t like being pushed around by anyone, especially not by journalists who hate him . If Mr. Tapper had belligerently demanded that Mr. Trump agree that the sky is blue, Mr. Trump would have bridled at that. Second, Donald Trump probably doesn’t know anything about David Duke or white supremacy. I would be astonished if he has ever looked into the thinking of David Duke or any other alleged “white supremacist.” It is his feistiness and his ignorance of white advocacy that explain his answers, not some carefully concealed racial consciousness. The press has also pounced on Donald Trump’s retweets of “racist” material, which is supposed to be yet more proof that he is a secret supremacist. Business Insider, for example, published this shocking story: “ 5 times Donald Trump has engaged with alt-right racists on Twitter .” Not one of these tweets is obviously “racist,” and it would be surprising if Mr. Trump or his skeleton staff took the time to vet the sources of the thousands of tweets @realDonaldTrump has sent during the campaign. Now the press is working on another smear-Trump angle. Recently, I have been contacted by journalists from such places as Bloomberg News, Reuters, and the New York Times , who clearly want to write that Donald Trump is “ mainstreaming hate ,” that he is responsible for a huge surge in the Alt-Right. They want to know about all the people who have been flocking to AmRen.com because of what Donald Trump says. They want me to tell them about people who have been “emboldened” to “speak out against minorities” because Donald Trump has led the way. They would love to find someone who now thinks he is free to run down the street shouting “nigger!” because Mr. Trump wants to take a hard look at Muslim immigrants . I have explained to them as patiently as I can that they have it the wrong way around. No one comes looking for AmRen.com because Donald Trump wants to build a wall. They come looking for us because the media have written about us in their attempt to convince the world that Mr. Trump is a “racist.” They come looking for us because Mrs. Clinton kindly called attention to us by complaining about the Alt-Right and her “ basket of deplorables .” I also try to explain that if the media had not launched its malicious campaign of trying to hold Donald Trump responsible for the views of certain people who support him, few people would have heard of the Alt-Right. In their zeal to paint their enemy in the darkest colors, they are promoting the Alt-Right, not Donald Trump. Rioting in Ferguson after Michael Brown was shot dead. Click to enlarge I explain that racial dissent has been growing like never before, for reasons that have nothing to do with the campaign. It is Trayvon Martin , Michael Brown , Black Lives Matter , and black rioters who are sending hundreds of thousands of frustrated white people our way– not Donald Trump. This will not change whether Mr. Trump wins or loses. The top landing pages on AmRen.com are analyses of race and crime–something Mr. Trump never talks about. I also explain to reporters that it is idiotic to think Mr. Trump has mainstreamed “hate,” by which they mean sensible observations about race. I ask them to name a single person who has been “emboldened” to say something “racist” just because Donald Trump is the GOP nominee. Of course, they can’t. If anything, it is the opposite. Mr. Trump has been called every name under the sun for the mildest, most common-sense observations about Muslims and immigration. Anyone tempted to come out of the closet is likely to hesitate more than ever. Things could change if Mr. Trump becomes president, but the candidate himself has done very little to spread our ideas. What Donald Trump has done is spark an unprecedented interest in politics among disaffected young people who recognize that Mitt Romney and John McCain are no different from Barack Obama when it comes to preserving whites, their society, and their culture. I know a number of millennials who never bothered to vote before but who certainly will in November. I know some who have made their first political contribution or who have spent weekends volunteering for the Trump campaign. I point out to reporters that this is what elections are supposed to be all about: giving the voters real choices. I note that the Trump/Clinton contest will almost certainly produce a record voter turnout for a modern election. Haven’t our rulers been wringing their hands over a lack of political engagement, especially among the young? Well, now they have engagement, alright, but they don’t like it. They don’t like it because so many people are stumping for the candidate they love to call a “ threat to democracy .” Liberals are such transparent hypocrites. They claim to love democracy, but suddenly start worrying about its health if the people refuse vote the way they tell them to. The whole Trump-is-a-racist fracas shows just how painfully fragile orthodoxy has become. I may be wrong, but I have no reason to think Donald Trump thinks at all as we do. He has never said or done anything to suggest he is anything more than an ordinary American with normal instincts: He doesn’t want criminals sneaking across the border, he thinks sanctuary cities for illegals are crazy, he doesn’t see why we need more Muslims, and he is angry when immigrants go on welfare. Millions of ordinary Americans clearly agree with him, and not because they are racially aware. It is because they are decent, fair-minded people who also have a nagging sense that the country is changing in unwelcome ways. I am convinced that Mr. Trump does not have a sophisticated understanding of race. So far as I can tell, he doesn’t have a sophisticated understanding of much of anything. He has stumbled by instinct onto a few sensible policies that white advocates have been promoting for a long time, but not because he is one of us. Maybe–just maybe–he will move in our direction. It’s not impossible to imagine a President Trump asking, in an offhand way, “What’s wrong with white people wanting to remain a majority in the United States?” Or he might casually note that you can’t expect as many blacks as Asians in AP classes because they don’t have the same levels of intelligence . But I can imagine the opposite, too: President Trump so bogged down in Beltway baloney that he never even builds the wall. There is one thing that Donald Trump has changed. He has proven that Republican bromides about taxes and small government don’t excite people. He has proven that there is tremendous anger against political insiders of both parties. He has proven that Americans do want their country to come first. They don’t want it to try to save the world or to be a dumping ground for people who have wrecked their own countries. And even if he has not “mainstreamed racism,” he has shown that if you have a backbone you can withstand what is surely the most intense and concentrated program of hate ever directed at an American. On October 11, Roger Cohen wrote in the New York Times that Donald Trump is a “phony, liar, blowhard, cheat, bully, misogynist, demagogue, predator, bigot, bore, egomaniac, racist, sexist, sociopath,” and a “dictator-in-waiting with a brat’s temper and a prig’s scowl.” [ Trumpism After Trump ] This must be one of the most unhinged, hysterical outbursts in the history of American political journalism. And it is unusual only for its wordiness, not its tone. Don’t the editors of the Times realize that this kind of frothing explains why more Americans believe in Bigfoot (29 percent) than trust newspapers (20 percent)? Virtually the entire industry is so consumed with rage at Donald Trump and contempt for his supporters that it cannot control itself. Open, petulant bias is driving more and more Americans to social media and to sites like AmRen.com for their news. Despite the concerted shrieking of virtually the entire American ruling class, Donald Trump is going to get close to half of the vote on November 8. Some 60 million people are going to vote for a man for whom Roger Cohen [] has emptied his dictionary trying to insult. Only one major newspaper has endorsed Donald Trump. Only one . And this is a man whom the American people might choose as their president. What better proof could we have of the stark difference between printed opinion and public opinion, between what Americans think and what our rulers want us to think? Donald Trump has ripped away whatever was left of the pretense of media objectivity. Whether he wins or not, whether he is one of us or not, Donald Trump has laid bare the collusion between big media and a political system in which both parties collaborate to run the country in their interests and those of their big donors. Voters–finally–have a chance to vote against the entire corrupt system. On November 8th they could bring it crashing down, but even if it still stands, it is visibly weakened, badly discredited. These are the perfect conditions in which our ideas will flourish as never before.

Samantha Power is a longtime Obama loyalist but her husband might be the key to all of this (see below).Power is believed to have made  hundreds  of unmasking requests to  identify individuals named in classified intelligence community reports related to Trump and his presidential transition team, according to multiple sources who said the behavior is unprecedented for an official in her position,  according to the Washington Free Beacon.Hannity asked Kredo how Power would ever have the authority to make the unmasking requests, and then asked whether this has ever happened previously to his knowledge. No, it s truly unprecedented,  Kredo said.  It s certainly odd, and I think the House Intelligence Committee, rightfully so, has subpoenaed her to find out what is going on here. Look, it s hundreds of unmasking requests in just the final year of the Obama administration. WE VE FOLLOWED THE  QUEEN OF GEORGE SOROS  AND HERE S WHAT WE KNOW:In 2005 06, Power worked as a foreign policy fellow in the office of U.S. Senator Barack Obama.In a 2007 interview, Power said that America s relationship with Israel  has often led foreign policy decision-makers to defer reflexively to Israeli security assessments, and to replicate Israeli tactics  The United States, she explained, had brought terrorist attacks upon itself by aping Israel s violations of human rights.Power has had her fair share of controversy, specifically after she was forced to resign from the president s 2008 campaign following negative remarks she made about Hillary Clinton.In an interview with The Scotsman during the heat of the 2008 presidential race, Power called Clinton a  monster. Power was soon back in with the Obama camp. Her husband is Obama s former Regulatory Czar Cass Sunstein.SUNSTEIN IS ONE SCARY GUY WHO WANTED GOVERNMENT TO INTRUDE ON YOUR PRIVACY:SALON reported:Cass Sunstein has long been one of Barack Obama s closest confidants. Often mentioned as a likely Obama nominee to the Supreme Court, Sunstein is Obama s head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs where, among other things, he is responsible for  overseeing policies relating to privacy, information quality, and statistical programs.  In 2008, while at Harvard Law School, Sunstein co-wrote a truly pernicious paper proposing that the U.S. Government employ teams of covert agents and pseudo- independent  advocates to  cognitively infiltrate  online groups and websites   as well as other activist groups   which advocate views that Sunstein deems  false conspiracy theories  about the Government. This would be designed to increase citizens  faith in government officials and undermine the credibility of conspiracists. The paper s abstract can be read, and the full paper downloaded, here.Sunstein advocates that the Government s stealth infiltration should be accomplished by sending covert agents into  chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups.  He also proposes that the Government make secret payments to so-called  independent  credible voices to bolster the Government s messaging (on the ground that those who don t believe government sources will be more inclined to listen to those who appear independent while secretly acting on behalf of the Government). This program would target those advocating false  conspiracy theories,  which they define to mean:  an attempt to explain an event or practice by reference to the machinations of powerful people, who have also managed to conceal their role.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Today, they are the source of ‘all conspiracy theories’ they are the inspiration behind many fiction novels, movies.\n\nIlluminati is considered as the secret organization that is really controlling the world, pulling strings from behind ‘the scene’ and steering the world towards a New World Order. But this all started back in 1776, Ingolstadt, Germany by a man named Adam Weishaupt who was a respectable professor.\n\n\nAdam Weishaupt’s idea was creating a better world. As a boy he was an avid reader, consuming books by the latest French Enlightenment philosophers in his uncle’s library. He was convinced that the monarchy and the church were repressing freedom of thought.\nAdam Weishaupt was not, he said, against religion itself, but rather the way in which it was practiced and imposed.  His thinking, he wrote, offered freedom “from all religious prejudices; cultivates the social virtues; and animates them by a great, a feasible, and speedy prospect of universal happiness.” To achieve this, it was necessary to create “a state of liberty and moral equality, freed from the obstacles which subordination, rank, and riches, continually throw in our way.” In this period Freemasonry was steadily expanding throughout Europe. This secret group offered appealing alternatives to freethinkers. Adam Weishaupt wanted to join this lodge, however, he decided later to create his own.\n\nOn the night of May 1, 1776, the first Illuminati met to found the order in a forest near Ingolstadt. Bathed in torchlight, there were five men.\n\nThere they established the rules that were to govern the order.\n\nAll future candidates for admission required the members’ consent, a strong reputation with well-established familial and social connections, and wealth.\n\nAt the beginning the order had only 3 levels: ‘novices, minervals, and illuminated minervals…’ The name “Minerval” referred to the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva, reflecting the order’s aim to spread true knowledge, or illumination, about how society, and the state, might be reshaped.\n\nA novice preparing to pass to the higher level of minerval, for example, had to present a detailed report on the titles of the books he owned, the identity of his enemies, and the weak points of his character. All members had to pledge the needs of a society before their personal.\n\nTHE RISE OF THE ILLUMINATI: \n\n\nOver the years the secret order grew considerably in size and diversity. By the end of 1784, the Illuminati had 2,000 to 3,000 members.\n\nAlthough, at first, the Illuminati were limited to Weishaupt’s students, the membership expanded to included noblemen, politicians, doctors, lawyers, and jurists, as well as intellectuals and some leading writers, including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\nThey included important people in Bavarian public life, such as Baron Adolph von Knigge and the banker Mayer Amschel Rothschild, who provided funding.\n\nBaron von Knigge played a very considerable role in the society’s organization and expansion. As a former Freemason, he was in favor of adopting rites similar to theirs.\n\nMembers were given ‘secret’ names from famous history characters. Weishaupt was Spartacus, for example, and Knigge was Philo.\n\nWith more members the number of levels in the Illuminati had to increase. There were 13 degrees of initiation, divided into three classes.\n\nHERE IS THE COMPLETE LIST OF ILLUMINATI CLASSES AND LEVELS: \n\n\nFIRST CLASS \nEach novice was initiated in humanitarian philosophy until he became a minerval. He then received the order’s statutes and could attend meetings.\nInitiate Novice Minerval Illuminatus Minor \nSECOND CLASS \n\nThe various degrees in this class were inspired by Freemasonry. The illuminatus major supervised recruitment, and the illuminatus dirigens presided over the minervals’ meetings.\nApprentice Fellow Master Illuminatus Major Illuminatus Dirigens \nTHIRD CLASS \n\nThe highest degree of philosophical illumination. Its members were priests who instructed lower-degree members. The lower orders of this class were themselves under the authority of a king.\nPriest Prince Magus King \nTHE PROHIBITION OF ILLUMINATI: \n\n\nThe secret society stood for some controversial opinions. They considered that suicide was legitimate, that its enemies should be poisoned, and that religion was an absurdity. However, when the Duke-Elector of Bavaria found the secret society was planning to conspire against Bavaria on behalf of Austria, it was then when he issued an edict in June 1784 banning the creation of any kind of society not previously authorized by law.\n\nBavarian police found highly compromising documents, including a defense of suicide and atheism, a plan to create a female branch of the order, invisible ink recipes, and medical instructions for carrying out abortions.\n\nThe evidence was used as the basis for accusing the order of conspiring against religion and the state. In August 1787, the duke-elector issued a third edict in which he confirmed that the order was prohibited, and imposed the death penalty for membership.\n\nAdam Weishaupt lived the rest of his life in Gotha in Saxony where he taught philosophy at the University of Göttingen.\n\nThe Bavarian state considered the Illuminati dismantled.\n\nTHE ILLUMINATI WAS JUST GETTING STARTED: \n\n\nAdam Weishaupt was accused of helping to plot the French Revolution.\n\nThis was the start of a war that will give birth to some of the greatest money machines that still exist today.\n\nThe secret society shifted its goals. They already had connections and knowledge. They didn’t need their society to be legal to exist.\n\nMembers chose to use the connections for making more money and profit because they realized with enough money you can control the world. You can control the laws. You can establish your agendas without being conflicted by ‘less’ enlightened people’s opinions.\n\n\nThe Illuminati have been fingered in recent events, such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Weishaupt’s ideas have also influenced the realms of popular fiction, such as Dan Brown’s Angels & Demons and Foucault’s Pendulum by Italian novelist Umberto Eco.\n\nAlthough his group was allegedly disbanded, Weishaupt’s idea still exists, pulling the strings.\nBut this article raises one really important question. Considering Adam Weishaupt’s first intent ‘a state of liberty and moral equality, freed from the obstacles which subordination, rank, and riches, continually throw in our way’ is it possible for this to be achieved and integrated into a society where people are not fully awaken?\n\nLife Coach Code \nSOURCE", "output": "0.

The worst have behaved deplorably, with hate crimes on the rise. You ve probably seen the less violent Trump supporters on social media, where they have been smug and sometimes verbally abusive. The takeaway, though, at least to them, is that there is still only one group of voters who matter in this country, and that s the white working class. The rest, according to Trump voters, should just bow down.This was the sort of behavior on display on Sunday s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, where the guests included right-wing shill Mary Matalin and liberal icon Van Jones. Needless to say, Jones didn t let Matalin go far with her condescending and downright insulting whitesplaining.After the election, Jones emotionally called the election what it was,  whitelash.  Here it is:The right, who could have chosen the magnanimous route and addressed Jones  concerns, instead chose to belittle him. Matalin did just that by telling him how, as a successful and educated black man, he should ignore racism and simply tell his fellow African-Americans that they too should bow to the white working class. Here s the transcript and video via Media Matters:MARY MATALIN: Van has, to my mind, retracted your whitelash with what you just said   No, that we have to not focus totally on the toxic stuff   OK, but you should, and if you don t you re wrong. You are not   that s not the path for progressives. We ve all agreed at the outset of this show that the path, which is Ellison s message, you say, is to go back to the rust belt and the rednecks   you re not going to get there with climate change and Putin and all the rest of  JONES: Now listen, I said and stand by it. I said that race was a part and there was a part, that alt-right part, it was a part of a whitelash. If you listened to the whole quote you would agree with what I said, so I don t take that back  MATALIN: I did listen and you said  what do I tell the kids.  What I would tell your kids,  I m a black man in America who went to Yale, who s written books, who served a president and now  JONES: And I m a ninth generation American man and I m the first one in my family born with all my rights. I m a ninth generation American, and so we have not escaped, because I went to Yale, all the problems of this country.Matalin went on to say that Jones should be a racial reconciler, not a polemicist. That s when Jones very politely and very quietly lost it.JONES: You should be ashamed of yourself for attempting to say that to my face. I have spent more time  MATALIN: Would I say it behind your back would be better?JONES: I spent more time than you have trying to be a racial reconciler in this country.MATALIN: Really? How do you know that? Do you know anything about me?JONES: Apparently you don t know anything about me.[ ]Here s the video:Trump voters need to know a few things. First off, only about a quarter of Americans voted for their candidate. Secondly, his election does not give them the moral high ground, and they certainly have not behaved well enough to lecture us on our behavior. Not that they ll listen to me. The implication with Trump s election is that for the next four years, discussions of racism and inequality are off the table. That s frightening. Any progress we ve made over the last several decades will go up in smoke.If Van Jones were any less a man, he probably would have lost his temper, and really, who could blame him. Instead, he handled being whitesplained to with class and elegance. That s so much more than Trump voters have shown him or the rest of us.Featured image via video screen capture.", "output": "0.

The MQM has called these brutal deaths as extra-judicial killings. On September 30, Syed Abdul Naveed, a MQM worker who was killed in the custody of para-military force. According to MQM sources, Naveed was brutally and inhumanly tortured to death while in custody and his dead body was dumped by the para-military rangers in rural Sindh, area called \"Ounger\" in the District of Thatta. 24News-HD TV reported, on August 28, that a MQM worker was killed in police custody. Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Provincial Assembly MQM's Khawaja Izhar-ul-Hassan called this terrorism by the government agencies. \nIn March, MQM leader, Dr. Farooq Sattar, said that some forty MQM workers were beaten up in Central Prison in Karachi by para-military force in order to extract 'favorable' statements from them. Not surprisingly in May,Director General (DG) Rangers, Major General Bilal Akber, accepted that a deceased MQM worker, Aftab Ahmed, was tortured by Rangers in custody for 90 days. General's statement came after pictures and videos were seen doing rounds on the social media, showing the corpse of the deceased MQM worker having major torture marks across his body. In June, Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) worker Waseem mysteriously died in custody at the Aziz Bhatti police station in Karachi. Waseem had been arrested by the police a few days back for allegedly possessing illegal firearms. According to DIG Police East Munir Sheikh, an FIR was filed in light of the findings of the post mortem report and all the concerned police officials have been taken into custody. Tellingly, in August, the Senate's Functional Committee on Human Rights rejected a report submitted by Sindh para-military Rangers regarding the human rights violations in Karachi Operation, declaring it \"fake and phony\". In the report, prepared by an unknown human rights organization called \"Human Rights Commission on South Asia\", Sindh Rangers were given a clean chit. Sindh Rangers has obtained a false report by a dubious NGO in a bid to convince the parliamentary body that \"it [Rangers] is not involved in human rights violations while conducting operation in Karachi\", Senator Farhatullah Babar said during the senate panel meeting. Rangers, commanded by Army Officers, are deployed in Karachi under the Anti-Terrorism Act, which provides broad powers to the Rangers and other state security forces that have facilitated serious human rights violations, according to the New York-based Human Rights Watch. Soldiers are permitted to \"shoot to kill\" after giving a warning, but are not bound by human rights standards that permit the use of lethal force only in self-defense or to protect the lives of others. They can conduct arrests and searches of property without a warrant. - Advertisement - The Rangers are a border security federal force under the Ministry of Interior, but operate under the command of the Pakistan Army. Military control over the Rangers effectively transfers key law enforcement duties in Karachi to the armed forces, which has a long record of committing human rights violations with impunity, the Human Rights Watch said. The Rangers have been implicated in serious human rights abuses, including torture and other ill-treatment of criminal suspects, extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances. The Rangers have been implicated in abuses across the political spectrum, Human Rights Watch said. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), a nongovernmental human rights organization, has also criticized the Rangers for enforced disappearances and other violations of due process rights, and stressed \"the need for transparency in security operations.\" The Human Rights Watch in its annual report pointed out that under pressure from the military leadership, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ceded significant constitutional and decision-making authority to the armed forces in 2015, particularly in the areas of national security, foreign policy, and human rights. \"The military muzzled dissenting and critical voices in nongovernmental organizations and media. The Rangers, a paramilitary force, were given complete control over law enforcement in the city of Karachi, where there were reports of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture.\" Shafi Burfat, exiled chairman of a nationalist group, Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), in a statement published on his website criticized the operation against the MQM. He says: - Advertisement - \"Sindh is a permanent colony of Punjabi imperialism and Punjabi Army will savagely, brutally execute every Sindhi conscious person who stands against the occupation, oppression and aggression of Punjabi military establishment. We strongly condemn harassment, arrests, abductions, torture, enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings of MQM activists All the bloodshed, plunder, torture, law enforcement violations are state created phenomenon created by Pakistani military,(the intelligence agency) ISI and its local stooges to exploit the resources of Sindh.\" About 90 percent of Pakistan army belongs to Punjab province. \nMuttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) came in direct conflict with Army on August 22, when its London-based self-exiled leader Altaf Hussain criticized the army and government officials of systematically targeting his workers.", "output": "0.

But the news media’s obsession with things Donald Trump has said consistently overshadows things Hillary Clinton has actually done. \nRevelations have now surfaced that Clinton backed the Puerto Rico Debt Relief Bill , a plan to help the financially struggling U.S. commonwealth deal with a $70 billion debt it managed to rack up, after a top Clinton fundraiser –who just happens to be a lobbyist for the Puerto Rican treasury— emailed his brother to discuss the situation. \nWho is this brother? None other than John David Podesta, Chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign. \nThe brother, Tony Podesta, has been well-compensated by Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican treasury department has paid Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman’s brother’s firm nearly two million dollars! \nThe email in question is from March 2015. At that point Puerto Rican treasury had already paid Tony’s firm, The Podesta Group, the $1.9 million since enlisting the firm’s services, whatever those are, in 2013. How does a government $70 billion in debt cough up $1.9 million to pay a consultancy firm, and what consulting or services was that firm providing? Specifically. \nTony Podesta, serving as President of The Podesta Group, emailed his brother with a subject line of “Puerto Rico.” The body of the email asked, “Can you call me today re PR. Need advice not action.” At the time Tony Podesta and other lobbyists in the firm were pushing for passage of congressional legislation to allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debt through a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing. \nA few months after the email between the Podesta brothers, Clinton officially backed congressional legislation authorizing Chapter 9 proceedings. Amazing timing. \nSo Hillary formally backed legislation to relieve Puerto Rico of billions of dollars in debt after her campaign manager’s brother emailed him seeking “advice” and after his client had paid him $1.9 million for “services.” \nWhat could those services be? Could they be… using one’s connections in Washington to help see to it the passage of a debt relief bill is assured? \nIf this doesn’t sound like influence peddling, read on. \nIn addition to being her campaign manager’s brother, Tony Podesta is a high-dollar Clinton donor and fundraiser. According to Federal Election Commission filings he has provided “ reportable bundled contributions ” of about $200,000 for the campaign. \nHe has also donated between $25,000 and $50,000 to –surprise, surprise– The Clinton Foundation. Is there anyone too shady for this foundation to accept cash from? \nHow many instances of cash contributions to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for favors, …allegedly… have there been now? One can barely keep track. We also just learned (also through Wikileaks) that the government of Qatar gave the Clinton Foundation a $1 million check for Bill’s birthday . \nWhy would a foreign government, any foreign government, let alone one in the Middle East, give a million dollars as a birthday gift? The secrecy, corruption, payoffs and general level of suspicious activity that surrounds this couple is astounding. \nExactly what the Podestas talked about isn’t known, but other hacked emails show that Clinton specifically asked her staff to craft public statements in support of Puerto Rican debt relief after the Podesta brothers apparently discussed the issue, but before Hillary publicly backed Chapter 9 proceedings. Could it be that some of that $1.9 million made it into Clinton Foundation bank accounts? \nCongress eventually passed and the president signed a Puerto debt relief package. As of this writing, neither the Clinton campaign nor the Podesta Group had responded to requests for additional information. \nThis cozy, cash-laden exchange typifies exactly what Donald Trump has tapped into. Americans by-and-large believe there is so much corruption, so much cronyism, so many snakes in the grasses around Washington that everyone is on the take, everyone is into someone’s pockets and the entire brood is wallowing around in the muck of get-rich politics. Wikileaks having hacked John Podesta’s email account and putting this information into the public domain only confirms the suspicions. \nOf course the other suspicion is that our “mainstream media” is equally corrupt and will not cover stories like this one. Sadly, the American public is mostly right on both counts.", "output": "0. Fake"}

I think that was a big mistake ,” said Senator Clinton. “ And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win. ” \nThe audio tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Eli Chomsky, an editor and writer, his audiocassette is the only recording of the meeting. \nNobody had heard it since 2006 – until today when he released it to the world. However mainstream media have attempted to blacklist the story, and Control The Record employees have been actively working to remove it from internet forums and social media. \nThe tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, but Clinton’s casually delivered comments about denying Palestinians democratic elections – stating that if they must have them, they should be rigged – has taken on new relevance in the midst of persistent allegations from Republicans that the Clinton camp is attempting to rig the Nov. 8 election. \nFixing foreign elections \nRecalling the 2006 meeting, Chomsky says he was taken aback that “ anyone could support the idea—offered by a national political leader, no less—that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections .” \nClinton also discussed the problem of global terror, and articulated phrases that Trump has accused her being reluctant to use publicly. \n“ I think you can make the case that whether you call it ‘Islamic terrorism’ or ‘Islamo-fascism,’ whatever the label is we’re going to give to this phenomenon, it’s a threat. It’s a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States…Therefore we need a global response. It’s a global threat and it needs a global response. \nChomsky is then heard asking Clinton a question about potential conflict in Syria – and Clinton gives him an entirely different answer to the public position she is pushing now. In fact, she sounds just like Donald Trump does in 2016. \n“ Do you think it’s worth talking to Syria—both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israel’s point [of view]? ” \nClinton replied, “ You know, I’m pretty much of the mind that I don’t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as you’re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them.” \nThe conversation moves on, but then Clinton returns to the topic. “ But if you say, ‘they’re evil, we’re good, [and] we’re never dealing with them,’ I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them…So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, I’ve got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. That’s my take on it. ” \nChomsky said that he held onto the tapes for all of these years due the Jewish Press’s reluctance to “ say anything offensive about anybody, ” but in the current election rigging climate he considered the contents of the tape to be in the national interest. \n“ I went to my bosses at the time, ” Chomsky said. “ The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody—even a direct quote from anyone—in a position of influence because they might need them down the road.

It s not an assassination attempt,  Tapper repeated before asking Conway,  Should they be spreading this misinformation? Of course, Conway tried to capitalize on the incident by bragging about how  nimble  and  resilient  Trump is, even though Secret Service agents were the ones who got Trump off stage and he retreated from a guy who was just holding up a sign. To Conway, the guy holding the sign was  scary  and she proceeded to smear him and ignore the fact that there was no assassination attempt. It s scary. All the coverage is usually about our protesters wreaking havoc and making people feel afraid. And it certainly goes both ways. I m with Mr. Trump and the Secret Service routinely. They do an amazing job. I also want to point out because some people are spreading misinformation about the protester. He had canvassed for Hillary Clinton and he had donated to her campaign. So, this is a Democratic plant or operative trying to disrupt our rally. And I think people saw a nimble resilient Donald Trump who would be nimble and resilient as president as well. Tapper responded by calling Conway out. Except it wasn t an assassination attempt. It was apparently a local voter, a Republican who says he is supporting Hillary Clinton. He has given money to Hillary Clinton. He has canvassed for Hillary Clinton. But he says he s a Republican. But most importantly, he was not trying to assassinate anyone. This was not an assassination attempt, but why is your campaign spreading that it was? That s really remarkable that that s what the storyline is here,  Conway whined before trying to bargain with CNN. Conway offered to stop spreading misinformation, but only if CNN retracts  all the storylines, all the headlines, all the breathless predictions of the last two weeks that turned out not to be true  that Trump is losing the election.Trump, however, is losing this election and is behind in the polls. So Tapper laughed at Conway and moved on.Here s the video via YouTube.Kellyanne Conway should be ashamed of herself and she should never be allowed to work again when this election is over.Featured Image: Screenshot", "output": "0.

Each one of you has the ability to release yourselves and others from the bondage of expectations, and to dance with life, exactly as you are, and exactly as life is. \nWe hear you now! “I expect to be treated kindly! I expect myself to do my best. I expect others to be honest! I expect my children to listen to me” and on the list goes. You may have these expectations dear ones, but what happens when you do not live up them? What happens when others do not? While it is fine to have expectations, you already know that life and others do not always act as you expect. You do not always live up to your own expectations. What then? \nFar better to say, “I expect to be treated kindly but if I am not I will discern what to do next.” “I expect to do my best, but when I do not, I will choose to learn.” “I expect others to be honest with me but when they betray my trust, I will walk away or let them know kindly what it takes to earn it once again.” “I expect my children to listen to me, but if they don’t, I will lovingly guide them in their lessons here upon the earth.” \nExpect the best of yourself and others dear ones, if you wish, but when you or they do not live up to these expectations, be flexible.

{"instruction": "Task: Please determine whether the text is 0. False, 1. TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Donald Trump will be seriously seething after he sees what GOP strategist Liz Mair called him on CNN.As we all know, the Republican nominee is incapable of keeping his big mouth shut. He always has to whine about something or someone and it hasn t been helping him gain a whole lot of support.For awhile now, Republicans and the media were being pushed around by Trump, but that has now changed as he has had a complete meltdown in recent days in addition to all the things he has said and done since last June when he began campaigning for the nomination.Republican strategist Liz Mair is definitely not a fan of Trump and she is sickened by the fact that Republican leadership didn t have the balls to intervene and stop Trump s rise when they had a chance to say something that could have made a difference. Now the entire party is in jeopardy of imploding.Indeed, Trump s message is the poison that is delivering the final death blow to a once proud party and Mair was only too happy to admit it during an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN on Wednesday night. His message is being a loudmouthed d*ck, basically. And going out there and offending people and then engaging in an airing of grievances. That s what he does. He doesn t have another message. He doesn t have anything else that he wants to convey. The Republican Party has a message but it s not his message and he has no interest in carrying it. And quite frankly, what I think we re gonna continue to see throughout this campaign is, we re gonna continue to see the Republican nominee basically acting as if he s on a suicide mission and aiming to take the whole rest of the party down with him. Here s the video via YouTube.Mair is absolutely spot on. The only critique here is that the Republican Party s message has been moving in Trump s extremist, bigoted direction for a long time now. Trump is merely taking it to it s final form and all of a sudden Republicans are acting horrified about it. But not so horrified that they aren t still willing to support him. And that s really the key here. Republicans can condemn his comments all they want. It doesn t mean a damn thing if they still support him as their nominee. Republicans created the hateful atmosphere that allowed Trump to rise in the first place. Their only redemption is to make sure he loses in November and just admit they were wrong and that they are going to seriously change their party this time around. And that means they have to stop pandering to the conservative base that desperately wants Trump to win and start transforming into a more inclusive party.Featured Image: Gustavo Caballero/Getty", "output": "0.

They may have decided on Trump. These things do not happen by accident.\" \" Sputnik \" - Thus spoke a high-level US business mover and shaker with secure transit in rarified Masters of the Universe-related circles, amidst the utter political chaos provoked by head of the FBI James Comeys latest bombshell.\nIts virtually established by now that US Attorney General Loretta Lynch told Comey not to release his letter to Congress. But Comey did it anyway. If he had not, and a scandal would  inevitably  spring up after the US presidential election, Lynch would be perfectly positioned to deny she knew anything, and Comey would be on the firing line.\nLynch is a certified Clinton machine asset. In 1999 then-President Bill Clinton appointed her to run the Brooklyn US Attorneys office. She left in 2002, taking the private practice revolving door. She was back to the Brooklyn office in 2010, urged by Obama. Five years later she became the 83rd US Attorney General, replacing the dodgy Eric Holder.\nA plausible case has been made that Comey took his fateful decision based on a serious internal revolt at the FBI  led by key people he trust  as well as being egged-on by his wife.\nYet one of the key questions that refuse to go away is why the FBI waited until 11 days before the US presidential election to supposedly \"find\" an email trove on certified sexting pervert Anthony Weiners laptop.\nA Deal With Donald?\nThe business source, although unsympathetic to the Clinton machine, especially in foreign policy, is a realpolitik practitioner, not a conspiracy theorist. He is adamant that, the FBI reversal could not have happened without orders above the President. If the Masters [of the Universe] have changed their mind, then they will destroy Hillary.\nHe adds, they can make a deal with Donald just like anyone else; Donald wins; the Masters win; the people think that their voice has been heard. And then there will be some sort of (controlled) change.\nWhats paramount in the whole soap opera is the faith in the US political system  as corrupt as it may be  must endure. That mirrors the faith in the US dollar; if confidence in the US dollar fails, the US as a hegemonic financial power is no more.\nThe source is equally adamant that, it is almost unprecedented to see a cover-up as extensive as Hillarys. A secret meeting between Bill Clinton and the Attorney General; the FBI ignoring all evidence and initially clearing Hillary to near rebellion of the whole of the FBI, attested to by Rudolf Giuliani whose reputation as a federal prosecutor is unquestioned; the Clinton pay for play foundation. The Masters are troubled that this is getting out of hand.\nThe record shows that the Masters do not usually have to go to such lengths to protect their own. They did manage to save Bill Clinton from the Monica Lewinsky perjury and keep him in the presidency. The Masters were not attacked in this case. They even got away with the 1987 cash settlement crash and the theft surrounding the Lehman debacle. In all these cases there were no overarching challenges to their control, as we see now open to the public by Trump. They antagonized and insulted the wrong man.\nAll Aboard the Huma Train\nHillary Clinton is not at the center of Comeys jaw-dropping October Surprise; its actually her right-hand woman and ersatz daughter Huma Abedin. This early January essay on Huma Abedin contains plenty of nuggets out and about  some of them positively eyebrow raising.\nIn case Hillary Clinton becomes the next President of the United States (POTUS), Abedin, alternatively known as Princess of Saudi Arabia, will most likely become Hillarys chief of staff  the power behind running all White House operations.\nA glimpse of the FBI-Huma Abedin connection is available here . Abedin was granted Top Secret security clearance for the first time in 2009, when Hillary named her deputy chief of staff for operations. Abedin later said she did not remember being read into any Special Access Programs (SAPs).\nIts crucial to remember that one of Abedins emails was huma@clintonemail.com. Crucial translation: she was the only high-level State Dept. aide whose emails were hosted by the notorious Subterranean Clinton Email Server  which she claimed she didnt know existed until she heard about it in the news.\nAbedin swore under oath in a lawsuit brought against the State Dept. by Judicial Watch that she had handed over all of her laptops and smart phones that could host emails relevant to the Subterranean Email Server investigation.\nThat may not have been the case. The laptop at the center of Comeys bombshell was shared by Abedin and her husband Wiener before they split. If Abedin lied, she could face up to five years in jail for perjury. As if the whole illegal email-cum-sexting saga was not sordid enough, the climax now seems to have turned into a mixed wrestling match between the former couple, with the big prize being the slammer.\nThe FBI has finally obtained a warrant and is now frantically searching no less than 650,000 Abedin emails found on sexting freak Wieners laptop; the objective is to exactly determine which ones came from the Subterranean Email Server.\nAs if this was not demeaning enough, the FBI continues to conduct an investigation on the Clinton Foundation. As former Assistant Director of the FBI Tom Fuentes said , The FBI has an intensive investigation ongoing into the Clinton Foundation the investigation would go forward as a comprehensive unified case and be coordinated, so that investigation is ongoing and Huma Abedin and her role and activities concerning Secretary of State in the nature of the foundation and possible pay to play, thats still being looked at now.\nWhatever happens until election day, US voters will have to consider the startling fact they may choose a next POTUS that is the subject of a wide-ranging comprehensive unified FBI investigation.\nA Rotten, Rigged System?\nA former federal public corruption prosecutor volunteers a plausible take on Comeys action. In a nutshell, FBI agents investigating Weiners sexting  and they are a different set of agents investigating Emailgate  saw evidence of State Dept emails on his laptop. Comey knew he needed a search warrant to comb the emails at Wieners computer. So he pre-empted the  inevitable  subsequent hype by sending out a vague letter to the Hill that in the end left everyone even more confused.\nThat interpretation though may be only scratching the surface. Deeper and deeper, it seems that Comeys decision was really precipitated by the senior FBI agents insurgence  fed up with the extreme carelessness Hillary cover-up. Theyve got to have some surefire material on the Clinton (cash) machine that never saw the light.\nComey could have just waited to say something after the election; after all the FBI maintains they had checked all Clinton emails, including deleted ones, not to mention the Podesta emails. So the emails on sexting Wieners laptop may be no more than a limited hangout.\nA much more plausible explanation is that Comey had to do it not only because of the FBI internal revolt (or because he had an urge to upstage WikiLeaks?) He had to do it because the rot goes way beyond the Clinton pay to play racket and involves virtually the whole system, from the deep recesses of the Obama administration to the War Party scam, the Department of Justice, the CIA and the FBI itself.\nWhat next? Brace for impact; it may well be the ultimate November Surprise.", "output": "0. Fake"}

The new case of the missing trillions, and the combustible political climate in the U.S. in 2016, has left many commentators fearing that “something big is about to happen again.”\nEveryone knows by now that the US military has the largest budget on the planet. It’s so large in fact, that it could pay for China’s military budget 3 times over. Which has to make you wonder, where does all of that money go? You may think that question has an obvious answer, since we are aware of most of the military’s weapon systems, personnel numbers, and equipment.\nIn reality, we don’t know. And when I say we, I mean even our own government doesn’t really know. In response to Congressional demands that the Pentagon provide a comprehensive audit of their finances for the first time, a Department of Defense Inspector General’s report was published last week. It revealed that the Pentagon could not provide documentation pertaining to $6.5 trillion in transactions.\nOn top of that, the report showed that the Pentagon “did not document or support why the Defense Departmental Reporting System . . . removed at least 16,513 of 1.3 million records during Q3 FY 2015. As a result, the data used to prepare the FY 2015 AGF third quarter and year-end financial statements were unreliable and lacked an adequate audit trail.” Sounds like the Pentagon is deliberately hiding some of their expenses, doesn’t it?\nWhich wouldn’t come as a surprise, since the Pentagon has been ignoring a federal law passed 20 years ago, which mandates regular audits for all government agencies. In that time, they’ve never once provided a good explanation for where their our money is spent. Is this money being burned up in fraud and waste, or are they spending it on clandestine activities that would outrage the American people? Since they never get in trouble for ignoring our auditing laws, we’ll probably never know.", "output": "0. Fake"}

A press conference was held on the crisis facing Texas that was created by the new immigration policies of the federal government. The sheriffs complained that aliens are being brought into the criminal justice system in Texas but are being released into the community because of the federal policies.In the past, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) could place a 48-hour hold on illegal immigrants when they were wanted on immigration related issues. The PEP program replaced the U.S. Department of Homeland Security s (DHS) Secure Communities plan and now that is no longer possible.The policy was released by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in November, 2014. In January, the program went into effect and Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby exclusively reported leaked training documents detailing how the program would be implemented. Darby dubbed the program,  Catch and Release 2.0. Breitbart Texas has reported many examples of criminal illegal aliens who have been previously deported many times only to come back and commit even more serious crimes.In July, Breitbart California s Michelle Moons reported on the murder of Katheryn Steinle. She was killed by an illegal alien who was released by the San Francisco sheriff despite an ICE detainer in effect. Her killer had been deported several times.The same week as Steinle s murder, Darby reported on the murder in Laredo, Texas, of a woman who was killed by her criminal illegal alien husband. He had been deported four times. Despite numerous domestic violence calls to the Laredo Police Department, he was allowed to remain in Laredo until he finally killed her.There have been many other such reports in the past month about violent criminal illegal aliens who commit more heinous crimes after returning from being deported.The lieutenant governor, Texas sheriffs, and the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies spoke at the press conference in Austin, Texas. Their message   the federal government has placed the public in danger through its policies, and these policies have essentially tied the hands of Texas law enforcement.Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (speaking) joined Sheriff Aj Louderback; Chambers County Sheriff Brian Hawthorne; Victoria County Sheriff Michael O Conner, and Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies for the Center for Immigration Studies. (Photo: Breitbart Texas/Lana Shadwick)Sheriff Louderback told Breitbart Texas,  This federal program (PEP) replaced a Congress-mandated program and replaced it with a program that now prioritizes criminal behavior and is excluding thousands of criminal aliens.  He says the program is forcing Texas sheriffs to sometimes release even violent offenders.Louderback said that criminal aliens know that law enforcement officials in Texas have their hands tied because of these new federal policies. They know they can come into the country illegally and stay here with impunity.He said illegal aliens cannot be held until after there is a final conviction. He said,  These criminals bond out and disappear into the country. These policies, say the immediate past sheriff s association president,  mean that local jurisdictions have to deal with the costs. Victoria County Sheriff Michael O Connor said criminal aliens are traversing over the border and coming in throughout the country. He said that the sheriffs intend to  connect, communicate, and collaborate with community stakeholders  to deal with the problem.Victoria County, Texas, is located about halfway between Houston and the Mexico/Texas border. He said his county is a  fatal tunnel between Harris County and the rest of the U.S. Sheriff Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas,  This is about a secure community program.  He said in 2008, law enforcement were able to do that. He said,  PEP is, and will be, a failure by this [federal] administration. Lt. Gov. Patrick promised that the senate would pass legislation to deal with the problems of sanctuary cities in the next legislative session.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Shawn Helton 21st Century WireEarlier this week Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly rejected an unprecedented US Federal Court order that would force the company to decrypt an iPhone linked to one of the San Bernardino shooters   a move that would have vast implications  PRIVACY & PROTECTION: Apple CEO Tim Cook challenges FBI court order to unlock private data of users (Image Source: Iphoneitalia)Breaching Public Privacy In a published open letter entitled,  A Message to Our Customers,   Apple CEO Tim Cook strikingly opposed a recent federal court ruling that would unlock a phone that s been connected to the San Bernardino Mass Shooting case.The FBI ruling stipulates that Apple must provide access for one time only. However, cyber security experts and technology companies insist this is a virtual impossibility and a guarantee that cannot be made.In theory, the decryption of the phone would be opened via a newly created operating system that would give the FBI a backdoor into the device. But according to many skeptics, this type of backdoor feature could set a very dangerous precedent, while possibly making it much easier for invaders (either government, or hacker) mining for data well into the future.In addition, the new iOS (not yet in existence) proposed in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting would give US law enforcement agencies broader access to consumer communications and other private information according to many in the tech industry. This reality was confirmed by Apple s chief executive Cook, who outlined the staggering privacy implications this past Tuesday: The FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation. In the wrong hands, this software   which does not exist today   would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone s physical possession. In essence, the FBI s court order demand appears to bypass basic privacy rights, and when seen in a bigger picture outside of the San Bernardino case, it could be viewed as a violation of the public s 4th Amendment.Challenging The RulingOver the past 48 hours, there s been a social media frenzy, as Facebook, Twitter and Google have all expressed their support for Apple s court battle with federal authorities. This has also included the often entertaining if not perplexing, self-proclaimed  cybersecurity legend  John McAfee of McAfee Inc., who wrote an op-ed published with Business Insider, that dissects the potential fallout of the federal court ruling in similar fashion to that of Cook.Here s some of what the controversial cyber guru turned libertarian presidential hopeful had to say about the dire security circumstances facing Apple and the world at large: Using an obscure law, written in 1789   the All Writs Act   the US government has ordered Apple to place a back door into its iOS software so the FBI can decrypt information on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. It has finally come to this. After years of arguments by virtually every industry specialist that back doors will be a bigger boon to hackers and to our nation s enemies than publishing our nuclear codes and giving the keys to all of our military weapons to the Russians and the Chinese, our government has chosen, once again, not to listen to the minds that have created the glue that holds this world together. Continuing, cyber expert McAfee, offered up a glimpse what could transpire in the event of a blackmail scenario if such a digital backdoor were to exist: In spite of the FBI s claim that it would protect the back door, we all know that s impossible. There are bad apples everywhere, and there only needs to be in the US government. Then a few million dollars, some beautiful women (or men), and a yacht trip to the Caribbean might be all it takes for our enemies to have full access to our secrets.   ANTIVIRUS PIONEER    John McAfee, well-known American computer programmer. (Photo businessinsider) McAfee then summarized his op-ed with a ready-made-solution to the FBI s demands by offering his services, I will, free of charge, decrypt the information on the San Bernardino phone, with my team, over a three-week period.On the surface, a sensational gauntlet has been thrown down, calling for the court of public opinion to weigh in on a very important topic concerning privacy rights. But there s much more to it This latest  privacy crisis  might be viewed through a more cynical lens, should readers choose to view this drama as a story featuring controlled opposition   especially when considering the pedigree of those supposedly opposed to the FBI s recent court order.Is it possible that Apple and others have staged opposition to this court decree as a way to bolster their public image, before eventually allowing the rights of private citizens to be abused? Both Cook and McAfee have direct links to companies plagued with security baggage such as Lockheed Martin and IBM, both of which have had their ethics put to question over the years.While there is nothing conclusive here, the public should consider this other side to the story and eliminate inconvenient possibilities in an effort to find the reality of the present circumstances, even if high profile tech leaders may appear to be saying the right things in public, purportedly in the interest of the general population.In an article featured here at 21WIRE from January of 2015, we learned of another privacy threat that should concern the public regarding biometric IDs   as facial and emotional recognition software has already been rolled out without public consent: More Orwellian technology is being rolled out, not just to make you into more of a commodity than you already are, but also to  profile  your emotions. With no regulation on this issue, corporations are basically writing the privacy rules as they go along. Do you trust them? Where is this really heading? In realty, they have no control over how third parties using their software might use images of people s faces and digital signatures of your  emotions , storing, sharing and selling that data across macro platforms. Sure, it s just another new wing of Big Data. Even social media data trawlers like Facebook has already begun moving into facial recognition of their users. So while it is compelling, and quite welcome to hear tech giants calling out the FBI s overreach, it appears that many in the technology sector have already pledged support for a growing police state apparatus by virtue of developing privacy invading software. For the moment though, it appears technology innovators Cook and McAfee, along with other social media companies, seem to be working on behalf of the public s interest, even though it could be out of concern for marketability rather than true worry about where the field of technology has been heading.Apple s iPhone and tablets introduced a biometric ID system with its thumb print login scan in 2013   a system which will store millions of biometric identifiers on Apple cloud servers. It wasn t long after the system was launched before hackers cracked the security for this biometric entry point, exposing another unspeakable privacy breach.If nothing else, it has caused a sharp debate over this pressing subject.  DIGITAL DANGER    The battle for consumer privacy hangs in the balance over the recent FBI court order. (Photo vibratingupdate)Problem, Reaction, SolutionAccording to the Guardian: For months, the FBI searched for a compelling case that would force Apple to weaken iPhone security   and then the San Bernardino shooting happened. This carefully planned legal battle has been months in the making, US officials and tech executives told the Guardian, as the government and Apple try to settle whether national security can dictate how Silicon Valley writes computer code. This past December, those of us at 21WIRE, pointed out a number of inconsistencies relating the heavily dramatized San Bernardino shooting attack. In fact, the media driven shooting attack said to have taken place at the Inland Regional Center had a laundry list of details that didn t add up.After a week of whitewashed reports regarding the shooting, a media scripted ransacking of the alleged  shooters  home (tampering with a potential crime scene) and eyewitness accounts that directly contradicted the official narrative from law enforcement, we learned that in the very room where 14 people were reportedly killed (along with 21 injured) at the Inland Regional Center, there was an  active-shooter  training drill/rehearsal, involving some of the victims almost a year before December s attack to place.Incredibly, a critical component that should be mentioned in the encryption battle involving Apple and the FBI, is that there were multiple eye-witness accounts that directly contradicted the terror-tale blamed solely on Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik. In other words, we have an event largely hinged on a barrage of convoluted and conflicting accounts concerning the San Bernardino attack.The eye-witness accounts near the scene of the shooting, never mentioned anything about seeing a female shooter, which 21WIRE also noted this past December: In fact, authorities did apprehend a third suspect but that aspect of the case, has seemingly gone down the memory hole, as has the very detailed eye-witness testimony from Sally Abdelmageed, (an Inland Regional Center employee) in a CBS interview with Scott Pelley, which clearly states that there were three white men in tactical gear dressed in black involved in the shooting event. Abdelmageed s account, echoed that of Juan Hernandez, who was interviewed shortly after the shooting incident by a local NBC affiliate, where it was described that  three white men in military fatigues,  had fled the scene in black Chevy Impala or SUV. Despite all of this, CNN, ABC, FOX and all other media outlets on the scene   all pivoted, in unison, to validate authorities  (the FBI) revised official  Jihadi Bonnie & Clyde  story of  only 2 shooters   a husband and wife . Additionally, a close colleague from Inland Regional Center, Chris Nwadike, stated that Farook had been acting normal and that  he was quiet,  and that he had not had a disagreement with anyone at the center the day of the shooting. Furthermore, the FBI themselves revealed that both Malik and Farook had not posted radical messages on social media which had previously been reported by authorities (and dutifully repeated across the mainstream media).Even though the media eventually admitted that there were no  radical posts , the idea of  social media postings  became a central story line suggesting that Malik had somehow influenced Farook into participating in the attack. Regardless of what really happened, it seems that the FBI had the opening it needed to try to force open direct access into personal devices.Is it also possible the security agency wants access to the encrypted phone so they can plant an additional back story to a shooting case that never made any sense?Food for thought to chew on in today s digital age As the privacy vs. security battle moves forward, Reuters news agency reports: The U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion on Friday seeking to compel Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to comply with a judge s order to unlock the encrypted iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters, portraying the tech giant s refusal as a  marketing strategy. The future of privacy hangs by a thread, as more and more divide and rule policies are being implemented at the expense of public freedoms.More to come on this story here at 21WIRE READ MORE SCI-TECH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Sci-Tech FilesREAD MORE DAILY SHOOTER NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Daily Shooter Files", "output": "0.

Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising?Donald Trump: “No, not at all” https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r \n— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 \n“So to people who say you’re taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?” Bash asked. \n“I say the following: You have been covering me for the last — long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I’ve been doing this for weeks straight,” Trump responded. \n“For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you’ll ask me that question. I think that’s a very rude question, to be honest with you.” Trump exclaimed. \nTrump added that the opening of the hotel also served to prove a point that he can get things built under budget and ahead of schedule, suggesting that the country needs to be able to follow suit. \nWhile CNN has continuously run defense for Hillary Clinton amid a myriad of scandals, and even rigged its own polls to suggest she won the debates, the network has been forced to admit that Hillary is running an extremely light campaign schedule. \nLast month, for example, Hillary went six days without an event except for a short speech she gave in Orlando, Florida. \nAnd in August, Hillary took seven of the first 14 days of the month off and even went four days without a single campaign appearance. \n“Her speeches are so short – they don’t last long, they’re like 10 minutes and ‘let’s get out of here,’” Donald Trump said about her schedule. “Go back home and go to sleep.” NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

(Photo: Screenshot)Robert Parry Consortium NewsIn discussing President Trump, there is always the soft prejudice of low expectations   people praise him for reading from a Teleprompter even if his words make little sense   but there is no getting around the reality that his maiden address to the United Nations General Assembly must rank as  one of the most embarrassing moments in America s relations with the global community.Trump offered a crude patchwork of propaganda and bluster, partly delivered as a campaign speech praising his own leadership   boasting about the relatively strong U.S. economy that he mostly inherited from President Obama   and partly reflecting his continued subservience to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.However, perhaps most importantly, Trump s speech may have extinguished any flickering hope that his presidency might achieve some valuable course corrections in how the United States deals with the world, i.e., shifting away from the disastrous war/interventionist policies of his two predecessors.Before the speech, there was at least some thinking that his visceral disdain for the neoconservatives, who mostly opposed his nomination and election, might lead him to a realization that their policies toward Iran, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere were at the core of America s repeated and costly failures in recent decades.Instead, apparently after a bracing lecture from Netanyahu on Monday, Trump bared himself in a kind of neocon Full Monte: He repeated the Israeli/neocon tripe about Iran destabilizing the Middle East when Shiite-ruled Iran actually has helped stabilize Iraq and Syria against Sunni terrorist groups and other militants supported by Saudi Arabia and   to a degree   Israel; He again denounced the Iranian nuclear agreement whose main flaw in the eyes of the Israelis and the neocons is that it disrupted their plans to bomb-bomb-bomb Iran, and he called for  regime change  in Iran, a long beloved dream of the Israelis and the neocons; He repeated the Israeli/neocon propaganda about Hezbollah as a terrorist organization when Hezbollah s real crime was driving the Israeli military out of southern Lebanon in 2000, ending an Israeli occupation that began with Israel s 1982 invasion; He praised his rush-to-judgment decision to bomb Syria last April, in line with Israeli/neocon propaganda against President Bashar al-Assad and partly out of a desire to please the same Washington establishment that is still scheming how to impeach him; He spoke with the crass hypocrisy that the neocons and many Israeli leaders have perfected, particularly his demand that  all nations   respect   the rights of every other sovereign nation    when he made clear that he, like his White House predecessors, is ready to violate the sovereignty of other nations that get in Official Washington s way.A Litany of WarsJust this century, the United States has invaded multiple nations without U.N. authorization, based on various  coalitions of the willing  and other subterfuges for wars of aggression, which the Nuremberg Tribunals deemed the  supreme international crime  and which the U.N. was specifically created to prevent.Not only did President George W. Bush invade both Afghanistan and Iraq   while also sponsoring  anti-terror  operations in many other countries   but President Barack Obama acknowledged ordering military attacks in seven countries, including against the will of sovereign states, such as Libya and Syria. Obama also supported a violent coup against the elected government of Ukraine.For his part, Trump already has shown disdain for international law by authorizing military strikes inside Yemen and Syria. In other words, if not for the fear of provoking American anger, many of the world s diplomats might have responded with a barrage of catcalls toward Trump for his blatant hypocrisy. Without doubt, the United States is the preeminent violator of sovereignty and international law in the world today, yet Trump wagged his finger at others, including Russia (over Ukraine) and China (over the South China Sea).He declared:  We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. Then, with a seeming blindness to how much of the world sees the United States as a law onto itself, Trump added:  The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. Of course, in the U.S. mainstream media s commentary that followed, Trump s hypocrisy went undetected. That s because across the American political/media establishment, the U.S. right to act violently around the world is simply accepted as the way things are supposed to be. International law is for the other guy; not for the  indispensible nation,  not for the  sole remaining superpower. On Bibi s LeashDespite some of his  America First  rhetoric   tossed in as red meat to his  base    Trump revealed a global outlook that differed from the Bush-Obama neoconservative/liberal-interventionist approach in words only. In substance, Trump appears to be just the latest American poodle on Bibi Netanyahu s leash.For instance, Trump bragged about attacking Syria over a dubious chemical-weapons claim while ignoring the role of the Saudi/Israeli tandem in assisting Al Qaeda and its Syrian affiliate; Trump threatened the international nuclear agreement with Iran while calling for regime change in Tehran, two of Netanyahu s top priorities; and Trump warned that he would  totally destroy North Korea  over its nuclear and missile programs while making no mention of Israel s rogue nuclear arsenal and sophisticated delivery capabilities.Ignoring Saudi Arabia s ties to terrorism, Trump touted his ludicrous summit in Riyadh in which he danced with swords and let King Salman and other corrupt Persian Gulf monarchs, who have long winked and nodded at ideological and logistical support going to Al Qaeda and other Islamic terror groups, pretend their governments were joining an anti-terror coalition.Exploding the myth that he is at least a street-smart operator who can t be easily conned, Trump added,  In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. No wonder Netanyahu seemed so pleased with Trump s speech. The Israeli prime minister could have written it himself while allowing Trump to add a few crude flourishes, like calling North Korean leader Kim Jong Un  Rocket Man   on a suicide mission ; referring to  the loser terrorists ; and declaring that many parts of the world are  going to hell. Trump also tossed in a plug for his  new strategy for victory  in Afghanistan and threw in some interventionist talk regarding the Western Hemisphere with more threats to Cuba and Venezuela about escalating sanctions and other activities to achieve more  regime change  solutions.So, what Trump made clear in his U.N. address is that his  America First  and  pro-sovereignty  rhetoric is simply cover for a set of policies that are indistinguishable from those pushed by the neocons of the Bush administration or the liberal interventionists of the Obama administration. The rationalizations may change but the endless wars and  regime change  machinations continue.

This week has been rough for our country. First, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton collapsed at the 9/11 memorial.

Needless to say, Seagal had enough. “I think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don’t get killed,” Seagal tweeted. “If you can’t do [email protected] “Pneumonia or not, she is going to be disastrous for the American people. #NoToHillary,” he continued. Of course, Seagal quickly became the target of liberal fire for his comments, but he refused to break down. He particularly lost it when one Twitter user tried to argued that Hillary was the most capable for the presidency. “Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,” he argued. He then went on to address race relations in the United States, and the true role President Barack Obama has played in the social evolution of this country. “Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,” he wrote. Seagal concluded by pointing out the irony of the attacks he was receiving from liberals everywhere. “Best thing in the world…Making one statement about freedom and getting attacked by every Demo out there… #HYPOCRITICAL,” he tweeted. “An America without a democrat in the White House, is a SAFER America.” What do you think of Seagal’s comments?", "output": "0.

On Friday the Korean Central News Agency released a statement attributed to North Korea’s Foreign Ministry that responded to comments Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made last week that were critical of the Hermit Kingdom. “This is an unpardonable insult and provocation to the dignity and social system in the DPRK and the choice made by its people,” the statement said of Netanyahu’s comments, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The statement then took issue with Israel’s foreign policy in the Middle East, stating: “Israel not only represents dictatorial forces for aggression that trample down the legitimate right of the Palestinian people and indiscriminately kill them but also is a rogue group that poses a nuclear threat and makes terrorist attack[s] on its neighboring countries with lots of nuclear weapons.” The statement was responding to comments Netanyahu made during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last week, in which the Israeli leader repeatedly drew parallels between Iran and North Korea. “And, Prime Minister [Abe], we have something else in common,” Netanyahu began. “We are two peace loving democracies that face formidable threats from nearby rogue states.” “Both Iran and North Korea are governed by ruthless and extreme dictatorships, states that seek to bully and intimidate their neighbors, and in our case, to actually eradicate us from the face of the earth.” Noting that “Iran and North Korea have aggressive military nuclear programs,” Netanyahu repeated his plea to not allow Iran to use diplomacy to advance its nuclear program as he alleges North Korea did with the 1994 Agreed Framework. “Iran cannot be allowed to travel the road taken by North Korea.” It’s not the first time that North Korea has slammed Israel or even Netanyahu publicly. After Netanyahu criticized Pyongyang during a trip to Japan last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry released a similar statement, which called Israel a \"cancer to peace in the Middle East.” It also accused Netanyahu of trying to use North Korea “to divert international criticism of Israel caused by its settlement activity and breakdown in the Middle East peace talks.\" Similarly, in last week’s statement, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said, “Everybody knows about the shamelessness of Israel telling lies and making fabrications and pointing accusing fingers to others to justify its criminal acts and evade the censure and condemnation by the international community.” Besides trading public insults, Israel has long been concerned about North Korea’s support for Arab states that are hostile to Israel, as well as Iran. In fact, during the 1973 Yom Kippur War North Korea actually deployed a squadron of MiG-21s to Egypt, which engaged in a firefight with Israeli F-4s. Neither side sustained any damage. More recently, North Korea has been accused of proliferating ballistic missiles and nuclear technology to Syria and Iran. In 2007, Israel destroyed Syria's Al Kibar Nuclear Reactor that was reportedly built by North Korean engineers.", "output": "0. Fake"}

You can say, \"There goes a beautiful girl\" or \"There goes a whore.\" What the hell's the difference? They've both got legs. ~ Jon E.M. Jacoby, executive vice president of Stephens Inc., explaining the Arkansas system of politics and finance as it reached perfection during the Clinton years Part 1 © Unknown In Arkansas, the latest backstairs of the national political system, you hear a lot of things. Concerning Whitewater, for example, you are constantly-- and probably correctly--reminded that the dustup involves nothing but a typical loony tunes savings & loans deal from the 1980s, despite the august personages involved and their perplexing insistence on behaving like refugees from a Raymond Chandler novel. In Arkansas memories are long, political rascality is king of regional sports and rumor and truth tend to commingle until otherwise reasonable people are driven slightly bonkers trying to sort out one from the other. In Little Rock the whole Whitewater affair is regarded as something of a hoot--the Yankee carpetbagger press, with the reality of Arkansas staring it in the face, has gone and missed the real story again. But if Whitewater was nothing but a minor peccadillo that the press has glommed onto because it thinks it understands it--and compared with the private financial shenanigans of Arizona Governor Fife Symington, Whitewater resembles a misdeed along the lines of crossing the street against the light-- why, then, has the Clinton administration so frantically placed its back to the door, as though a peek beyond would reveal grandpa tied to a chair, surrounded by his looted bank books? In Arkansas the answer to this question eerily resembles the epitaph on the tombstone of Sir Christopher Wren: if you would see Clinton's monument, look around. When it comes to Bill Clinton's home state, the national press has repeatedly looked, seen everything and observed next to nothing (the honorable, largely ignored exception being the Los Angeles Times ). Visiting Little Rock in search of atmosphere during the presidential campaign, reporter after reporter dutifully described the imposing Stephens Building, the elegant Capitol Hotel, the Worthen Bank tower and the headquarters of Arkla Petroleum, future White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty's gas company, without realizing that all of these things were either owned, controlled or under the influence of a single, immensely powerful family: the Stephenses . By a happy chance, the family is also the stellar client of Hillary Rodham Clinton's old employer, the Rose Law Firm . Although it usually served as a hired gun with a conveniently blind eye, Rose proves to be a handy prism for observing a Gothic, sometimes darkly humorous tale of bonds, banks, a friendly cocaine distributor, sinister Pakistanis, shadowy Indonesians and the uses to which an agreeable state government can be put. The story is in fact three connected stories, combined in a typically Southern saga: Stephens Inc. and the Worthen Bank Corporation; the Rose Law Firm itself; and the Arkansas bond business, which, like most bond businesses, is extremely difficult for the well-educated layman to understand, thus making it an excellent place to hide things in plain sight. Central to the story is a pair of siblings named Witt and Jackson Stephens. Part 2 In one sense, nothing unusual occurred in Arkansas during the 1980s: tales of high jinks in high places have always figured prominently in American discourse, and some of the most colorful stories--a number of them actually true--have come out of the Bubba Belt of the South and Southwest, whose geographical heart happens to be occupied by Arkansas. But Arkansas is rendered sui generis by the presence of the only major investment bank not headquartered on Wall Street, Stephens Inc. of Little Rock, which does much to explain some of the arresting peculiarities of a state that is more than a little strange even when judged by the spacious standards of its region. For one thing, although Arkansas is the home to some of the nation's wealthiest families, it is one of the poorest states in the country , although there is no reason for it to be poor at all. Abundantly endowed with minerals, petroleum, timber and some of the most fertile agricultural land on the surface of the planet, it bears a close resemblance to a Third World country, with a ruling oligarchy , a small and relatively powerless middle class and a disfranchised, leaderless populace admired for its colorful folkways, deplored for its propensity to violence (on a per capita basis, Little Rock has one of the highest murder rates in the nation) and appreciated for its willingness to do just about any kind of work for just about any kind of wage. In the words of one local wag, the farther you get from Arkansas, the better the Stephens boys look. Indeed, the family's sanitized, Horatio Alger- like biographies have been featured, accompanied by a remarkable lack of examination, in publications as various as Forbes and Golf Digest . The dynasty's founder, Witt Stephens, together with his younger brother by sixteen years, Jackson, grew up on a hardscrabble farm near the town of Prattsville, the sons of a small-time speculator in oil stocks and sometime state legislator, A.J. Stephens, who remained a power in state Democratic politics until the end of his life. An eighth-grade dropout, Witt first made his living by peddling Bibles and belt buckles before he discovered a pair of bonanzas in undervalued, Depression-era municipal bonds and the natural gas with which Arkansas is so richly endowed. Meanwhile, Jackson briefly served as a page with his father in the state legislature and went on to become a classmate of future president Jimmy Carter at the Naval Academy, a circumstance that would later serve the family's fortunes well while causing a disaster of still unmeasured magnitude in the American banking system. After World War II the brothers joined forces at Stephens Inc. in Little Rock, with Witt--or Mr. Witt, as he came to be known--serving as the company's colorful, cigar-chomping and aphoristic face to the world (or as much of the world as paid attention) while the taciturn Jack toiled away in the back office, revealing a golden touch at investment strategy. These things are relative, of course; by the time Witt (who died in 1992 at the age of 83) handed over the reins to Jack in 1957, while retaining his petroleum interests and serving as the presiding genius of the firm, Stephens Inc. was worth a beggarly $7.5 million. But in the Arkansas of 1957, a financial institution with $7.5 million had the money and the clout to do a number of things--including purchase a governor. Witt, like his father before him, was a staunch hereditary Democrat, a supporter and friend of such Arkansas luminaries as Senator William Fulbright. He was also a great patron of the infamous, six-term Orval Faubus--not, apparently, because of the governor's segregationist policies (to the family's credit, Jack Stephens, a trustee of the University of Arkansas since 1948, had successfully lent his voice to the cause of integrating the institution), but because Faubus was sound on the subject of natural gas, a subject dear to the Stephens' heart. As the family's fortune continued to wax after the Faubus years, it became an axiom of Arkansas politics that someone could occasionally become governor without permission from Stephens headquarters, but the politician was unlikely to remain governor for very long unless he paid close attention to the care and feeding of the brothers-- the great exception to the rule being two-term Republican Winthrop Rockefeller, the beneficiary, representative and broken reed of an even vaster American fortune, who became the failed hope of Arkansas liberalism. Decades later, when the self-effacing Jack became chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, naive visitors were quickly enlightened on the subject of how a man so shy could assume a post so prominent in the sport of the moneyed and the gently bred. \"Jackson Stephens?\" it was explained. \"He's the man who owns Arkansas.\" It was with Jackson Stephens at the helm that Stephens Inc. propelled itself into the stratosphere of the American financial plutocracy, making a bewildering variety of investments in enterprises as various as real estate, hazardous waste incineration, data processing, nursing homes, trucking and airplane maintenance, while simultaneously diversifying into the business of underwriting issues of common stock. In its new role, the firm called on the services of young C. Joseph Giroir, the only trained securities lawyer in the state, and his paralyzingly respectable firm, Rose. The securities business, in turn, led to a chain of peculiar events beginning in 1977 (the year, it so happened, that Bill Clinton became Arkansas attorney general and that Rose hired his wife). That year, no less a figure than T. Bertram Lance appeared on the corporate doorstep of his old friend's classmate, bringing with him a load of troubles and a glittering opportunity. Lance was compelled to resign as head of Jimmy Carter's Office of Management and Budget because of his long history of questionable financial practices in Georgia. As a result of that history, he was also beset by a negative net worth, substantial loans from banks in Chicago and New York and a large stockholding in the National Bank of Georgia. Sadly for Lance the price of the bank stock was depressed and its sale on the open market could not rescue him from the specter of bankruptcy, which was the dilemma Stephens Inc. was invited to solve. A solution was soon found in the form of the now notorious Bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI) , although whether Lance introduced Stephens to the Pakistani-run scam or vice versa is a matter of some debate. Beyond dispute, however, is the fact that the comptroller of the currency, the nation's principal regulator of commercial banks, had clearly stated that BCCI was never to enter the American banking system under any circumstances. Oddly, this unambiguous order did nothing to prevent Stephens Inc. from solving Lance's problems while settling a small score of its own. The National Bank of Georgia was controlled by a holding company called Financial General, one of the few entities in the country allowed to engage in interstate banking under the laws of the time. The Stephens interests controlled slightly less than 5 percent of Financial General and the investment had soured, partly because Financial General refused to hire the family's data processing company. It was, Stephens soon persuaded BCCI, just the sort of investment BCCI was looking for, the comptroller's edict notwithstanding. Comment: BCCI was pretty much the global (not 'Pakistani') financial instrument that got the Western 'war on terror' up and running, funneling weapons to terrorists via payments of hard drugs, prostitutes and cash. In short order, Stephens launched Lance on the path to renewed solvency, assembled blocks of stock for purchase by the front men who would conceal BCCI's identity, effected an introduction to the subsequently disgraced Democratic wise man Clark Clifford, turned a small but tidy profit on the sale of its own shares, pocketed fees of at least $95,000--and, in return for a sum that in Stephens terms amounted to chump change, set in motion the process that would give BCCI its long-sought beachhead in the American financial community. When subsequently confronted with its BCCI involvement by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Stephens Inc. neither admitted nor denied the sec's findings but promised to go and sin no more. But BCCI was not the only exotic party attracted by Lance's bank holdings. Also appearing on the scene was Mochtar Riady, one of the wealthiest men in Indonesia, with far-ranging interests and a known connection to his country's dictator, General Suharto . When someone went into business with Riady, there was also the possibility that they were in business with the general, a fairly decent chap by dictatorial standards (he had begun his reign with the slaughter of 200,000 supposed Communists, a feat he had not found necessary to duplicate except on the island of Timor) but a tyrant nonetheless. Stephens Inc., which appeared to be uninterested in the true activities of BCCI, exhibited a similar indifference when it came to Riady. Moreover, the Stephens people did not appear to be the least bit curious about the business endeavors of the distinguished former statesman who effected the introduction between Jakarta and Little Rock. This was Robert B. Anderson. Formerly a secretary of the treasury in the Eisenhower administration, Anderson had carried out diplomatic assignments for President Lyndon Johnson in the Middle East and had served as President Richard Nixon's chief negotiator in the Panama Canal talks before opening an offshore bank--Commercial and Trade Bank and Trust Ltd. on Anguilla--that catered to people who needed to launder money, evade taxes, or both. Jack Stephens had willingly presided over the handoff of a big hunk of an American bank to a bunch of Pakistani thugs, but he was not willing to let Riady go so easily. \"He wanted to buy into an American bank, an idea I was not enthusiastic about,\" Stephens told an interviewer some years later, perhaps making an unconscious semantic distinction. He'd seen nothing wrong with selling BCCI an American bank--they even named it First American--but he and Riady soon began planning an entirely new kind of Arkansas bank holding company, for which they required the services of Giroir and his expertise in securities law. But they also needed something that increasingly became a hallmark of the Rose firm: a willingness to perpetrate a subtle conflict of interest. Founded in 1820, well before Arkansas became a state, Rose is one of the oldest surviving law firms west of the Mississippi, one of the most competent and one of the most quietly influential. Often, in looking at the state government of Arkansas, the Rose firm and the Stephens interests, it is hard to escape the impression that one is looking at a single entity, rather along the lines of NATO. The law partnership takes its curious name from U.M. Rose, a talented attorney who dominated the firm from the mid-1860s to the end of the century, was one of the founders of the American Bar Association and is one of two Arkansans whose statues adorn the Capitol in Washington. Over the years Rose has provided Arkansas with numerous legislators and justices of the state supreme court. In 1957, when the modern civil rights era was born in Governor Faubus's refusal to integrate Little Rock's Central High, it was a Rose lawyer who acted as lead counsel to the school board. (Rose still has no black partners.) And from 1975 until 1988 the firm enjoyed a spectacular run--growing from seventeen lawyers to fifty-three--under the leadership of the dapper and charming Giroir, the first and only chairman in the history of Rose, who deeply entwined the partnership and his personal destiny in the affairs of the Stephens family's empire. During the Clinton administration, the history of the Rose firm could be divided into two periods: the Giroir years, and the shorter period, from 1987 to 1992, when the firm claimed to be a democracy, voting on its future rather than blindly following a single, charismatic leader. This democracy, however, was publicly dominated by three partners: the amiable Webster Hubbell, who was until a few days ago associate attorney general; the quiet Vincent Foster, who was deputy White House counsel until his suicide last summer; and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who as of press time is still First Lady. The firm's sea change, which generated a certain amount of hoopla from the legal press, was more apparent than real. Under the surface, Rose was much the same as always, doing good for its friends and clients while doing well for itself, but much more silently. In his years as Rose's chief, Giroir conspicuously chaired a group drawn from the state's so-called Good Suit Club. The club successfully lobbied the legislature to change the state usury law, which made owning an Arkansas commercial bank a much more attractive proposition. It also was active in convincing the state's lawmakers to revise the law restricting the formation of bank holding companies, which enabled Giroir, Riady and Stephens to make a substantial and potentially lucrative investment. On his own, Giroir had purchased control of four Arkansas banks. He sold all four--including the second-largest bank in the city of Pine Bluff--to Worthen Banking Corporation, the new holding company Riady and Stephens had been able to set up after state law, with Giroir's help, had been made more congenial to such things. For his part in the deal, Giroir was compensated with $53,760,294 in cash, stock and assumed debt. He also became a major stockholder of Worthen (named after the venerable and very large Little Rock bank that was the pride of the Stephens commercial banking empire) and a powerful member of its board. He received further income by renting property to the company, and he pocketed an additional $2.1 million when he sold part of his stockholdings to a company affiliated with Riady's son James (who was also Worthen's co-president). More important, he managed to create a whole new client for his firm; Rose became Worthen's principal outside counsel. These things are complicated, dull and dry, which is an excellent form of concealment, but consider the sequence of events. With the stroke of a pen and without a visible second thought, then-Governor Bill Clinton, following his traumatic period as a voter-rejected civilian between 1980 and 1982, gave life to two pieces of legislation inspired by his wife's boss--revising the usury laws and permitting the formation of new banking holding companies. In a state as small as Arkansas, where everybody of importance knows everybody else, it seems impossible that Governor Clinton could not have known that the relevant legislation would be of immense personal benefit to the boss in question, the state's most powerful family and an Indonesian investor whose presence in Arkansas seemed to be regarded as the most natural thing in the world. Last and not incidentally, the governor, by permitting the creation of the Worthen Bank Corporation, had arranged a new payday for the Clinton family through the windfall in legal fees provided to the Rose firm (Hillary Rodham Clinton, partner). When the compensation of the firm's partners was computed, Rodham Clinton has insisted, she specifically exempted herself from receiving a share of Rose's business with the state. But although Worthen could not have been brought to life without the help of her husband's government, it was not a government agency. Rodham Clinton was therefore not excluded from a partner's share of its fees. More important, Worthen also became a major depository of the state's tax receipts. Nothing unusual here; governments frequently park their undeployed funds with large private banking institutions until they decide what to do with the money. But the results soon proved to be imprudent under the most charitable interpretation of the word. In 1985 Worthen Bank managed to lose $52 million of Arkansas state taxpayers' money in a purchase of government securities from a New Jersey brokerage with a questionable past and no future whatever; several of its principals ended up in jail for fraud. With its capital wiped out in a single stroke and a seizure by federal regulators imminent, Worthen was swiftly rescued with a $30 million cash infusion from its major stockholders, in the form of a loan that paid the Stephens partners a handsome 10 percent--together with additional funds from Stephens Inc., which pocketed a $3.2 million fee for its trouble. (The risk, in true Stephens fashion, was not great. Two-thirds of the funds were swiftly replaced by Worthen's insurance company, which made Stephens Inc.'s noble rescue of the bank--and of a big hunk of the Arkansas treasury--an almost surefire, profitable investment.) Also conspicuous during the complex negotiations were Joe Giroir and his partner Webb Hubbell, appearing in their capacity as members of Rose. Two questions surround this incident. First, how could Worthen have allowed the state to make such an obviously tainted investment via the New Jersey brokerage firm? Second, and more important, why did nobody in Arkansas appear before the bar of justice? The New Jersey firm was a direct lineal descendent of a peculiar regional phenomenon: the world of so-called bond daddies. The bond-daddy racket, long centered in Memphis but with many of its members drawn from Arkansas, specialized in selling questionable government securities to gullible investors, principally small banks with little financial sophistication. Here is where the oddity begins, at least as it concerns Worthen. The Stephens brothers, if not Giroir and Riady, were intimately familiar with the black arts of finance. They were also experts in the government bond market. Moreover, at least one of the principals in the New Jersey brokerage of Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Inc. (which executed the transaction for Worthen and the state of Arkansas) was well-known in the region. Bevill's operations had all the earmarks of a standard bond- daddy scam, and yet Worthen committed $52 million anyway. (At the bank, the official explanation was that co-president Jim Jett acted naively, on his own and without the supervision of his principal stockholders, which is possible but not entirely plausible, since Giroir, who represented the Stephenses, sat on the board.) Consider a virtually identical event at the same time in Ohio, in which a savings bank controlled by Marvin Warner, Jimmy Carter's ambassador to Switzerland, invested in the same kind of fraudulent securities, destroyed itself, ignited a statewide financial panic and caused Governor Richard Celeste to declare the first Ohio bank holiday since the Great Depression. A number of the responsible parties, including Warner, found themselves behind bars, some for a very long time. Why? Under long established Anglo-American law, an officer or director of a bank is governed by the \"prudent man\" rule, which states that he is personally responsible for the financial and legal consequences of his acts. In Arkansas, where the prudent man rule seems to have been suspended, a number of people were fired, but the Clinton government hauled precisely no one into court on criminal charges. Once again in Clinton's Arkansas, the law seemed to be different than it was in the rest of the United States--which makes certain Arkansans smile in knowing amusement over the fact that Bill Clinton now happens to be running the United States . Part 3 The near failure of Worthen in 1985, like the arrival of BCCI, proved to be another pivotal event in recent Arkansas history: Stephens, Worthen, Rose and the Clintons remained at the center of the stage, but the cast of supporting players began to change. A former Stephens executive named Ray Bradbury, who had been deeply involved in the bcci negotiations--hardly a job qualification, one would think--took the helm at Worthen, where he discovered that the bank was also stuffed with bad real estate loans. Meanwhile, federal regulators learned that the bank had made an excessive number of insider loans, particularly to the Riadys, although what happened next is, as usual, a matter of mutually exclusive explanations. Knowledgeable observers in Little Rock and elsewhere say that the Riadys were slowly forced out of the bank by the federal government; at Worthen, the official version says that the Riadys disengaged because it was clear the troubled bank could not be a major force in international finance. In any event, the Riadys soon departed. The role of Joe Giroir also underwent a change. As a principal owner of Worthen, he was charged with securities fraud in a shareholder suit; he was also sued by Worthen itself for taking illegal \"short-swing\" profits when he sold stock to the Riady affiliate. Not only did Giroir lose his board position and partial ownership of the bank--with Giroir and Riady out of the picture, the Stephenses gradually increased their stockholding to more than 40 percent, while stoutly denying they controlled the place--but, following Giroir's disgrace in 1988, Rose lost Worthen as a client that had once paid the firm hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. As for Giroir, his troubles were far from over. In 1986 he was revealed to be a shareholder in and a substantial borrower from a Pine Bluff thrift called FirstSouth, the first billion-dollar savings & loan failure in the country . Comment: Isn't that curious; the first S&L bust happened under the Clintons' watch. Before the dust had cleared, the head of FirstSouth had gone to jail together with a former president of the Arkansas Bar Association, and Giroir had sued the federal regulators while the federal regulators were suing him, putting a considerable crimp in the plans of his partners, Hubbell and Foster, to create a lucrative practice in the cleanup of the s&l crisis. (At failed s&ls, the fees for firms like Rose could be enormous. According to one frustrated federal investigator, private lawyers in Dallas were making $500,000 per month from the thrift catastrophe, more than the total annual budget for the federal cleanup effort in the entire state of Texas--and in Arkansas, where lawyers were cheaper, the damage per capita was among the worst in the country. Somehow, Governor Clinton escaped criticism for this interesting fact.) It was clear that Joe Giroir, who had built the modern Rose Law Firm, was now the partnership's greatest liability--the firm's reputation aside, federal regulators charged that Giroir had used Rose letterhead to give FirstSouth legal advice beneficial to himself; Rose was forced to settle with the Federal s&l Insurance Corporation regulators for a reported half-million dollars--although once again there is a contradictory official version of his abrupt departure. Giroir once claimed that he left the firm voluntarily but will no longer comment on the matter. The Rose firm fell abruptly silent on this and all other subjects following recent allegations that it had shredded its Whitewater files, but its spokesman told American Lawyer in 1992 that Giroir departed in a coup arranged by litigators who were miffed that he and the firm's other rainmakers were paid substantially more than the lawyers who actually did the scut work in court--litigators prominently including Hubbell, Foster and Rodham Clinton, who actually seemed to be engaged in very little legal work at all. With the departure of Giroir, life at Rose became quieter if no less active. The three partners became the firm's public face to the world. The most physically imposing and locally active of these was Hubbell, a six-foot, five- inch giant of a man who had played football for the University of Arkansas, had almost made it into the big time with the Chicago Bears, had served briefly as mayor of Little Rock (when Rose received a significant portion of the city's bond business) and had received an interim appointment as chief justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court from Governor Clinton. (According to a reliable source, Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward, a septuagenarian self-made entrepreneur, once complained that keeping Hubbell in politics cost him $100,000 a year.) The second was Foster, once described as an immaculately brown-suited man in an immaculate brown office, who was regarded as the \"soul\" of a firm that, according to grand jury testimony, shredded volumes of his records the moment an independent federal prosecutor appeared in the vicinity . The last was Rose's first female partner, Rodham Clinton, who occasionally did some lawyering in the intervals when she wasn't working for the Children's Defense Fund, attending to her personal business affairs or serving as the governor's first lady. The three were described to American Lawyer as \"big, big buddies\"; Rodham Clinton's office was next door to Hubbell's, and much of her work was actually done by Foster. Comment: Hubbell is very likely the father of Chelsea Clinton. And Foster, another 'lover', was suicided shortly after he followed Killary to the White House. The three also were closely entwined in a curious financial arrangement. This was Mid-life Investors, a partnership set up by E. F. Hutton in 1983. Hubbell, Foster and Rodham Clinton each kicked in $15,000 and named each other--rather than their spouses--as beneficiaries. But although the fund was active at least until 1991, Rodham Clinton reported annual dividends of under twenty dollars from Mid-life Investors, a sum that comes as a surprise to Roy Drew, the financial counselor who supervised the partnership and invested its money in such 1980s takeover candidates as Diamond Shamrock and Firestone Tire. According to Drew, with the likes of Sir James Goldsmith and the Japanese offering huge sums for the stock of Shamrock and Firestone, there was no way Mid-life Investors could have failed to reap substantial profits. Although Rodham Clinton was a litigator--that is, a lawyer whose task is to appear in court, if only to force the other side to settle--and an attorney who was named one of the 100 most influential in the country by the National Law Journal in 1988 and 1991, she was almost never seen in the courtrooms of Little Rock ; some court reporters remember an occasional appearance, and one could not remember having seen her at all. According to a search conducted by American Lawyer , she tried just five cases during her fifteen years at Rose; other published sources say her work revolved around copyright infringement cases involving songwriters and bread companies. But paradoxically, in view of what happened to Giroir, she (like Giroir) received extra compensation for the business she generated from her extracurricular activities, even if she did not work on the cases at all. For example, she was only one of two Rose partners to act as a corporate director, serving at various times on the boards of four companies and earning $64,700 in 1991 from director's fees alone . (Her 1991 salary from Rose was in the vicinity of $110,000; her husband earned $35,000 and got to live in a free house.) She was on the board of Wal-Mart, a Rose client that Stephens had launched on the road to glory . (Rodham Clinton also owned $80,000 worth of Wal-Mart stock.) She served Southern Development Bancorp, a holding company created to give development loans in rural Arkansas, which, according to The Washington Post , paid Rose somewhere between $100,000 and $200,000 in fees. In 1989 she joined the board of TCBY yogurt company, which occupies the tallest building in Little Rock. TCBY then proceeded to pay Rose $750,000 for legal work during the next few years. Last, and puzzlingly, she was a director of Lafarge, a giant French cement company that had no discernible connection to Arkansas except, like Stephens Inc., it was engaged in burning hazardous waste . (As president, Bill Clinton did nothing to stop operation of an Ohio waste incinerator, partly backed at one time by Stephens Inc., despite the fact that it didn't work, had no legal permit and his own vice president had promised that it would never operate until it was thoroughly investigated, which it wasn't.) Comment: That's the same Lafarge recently caught trading with Head-chopper Inc, ISIS: Paris strikes corporate partnership with Lafarge, who secretly sponsored ISIS for profit and has ties to Killary With Rodham Clinton aboard at Rose, the firm's long established connections to the governor's office were made firmer still. Rose, the gold standard of Arkansas law firms, had long enjoyed unusual access to the state's corridors of power. It both advised and did the bidding of the powerful family that acted as the state's shadow government, and during the Clinton years, the Rose Law Firm sometimes behaved as though it were an agency of the state rather than a legal partnership with offices in a converted YMCA. The intimate connection between Rose, Stephens Inc. and the governor's office may help explain how the Stephens family made a vast amount of money when its most visible enterprises were doing no such thing.

{"instruction": "Task: Please determine whether the text is 0. False, 1. TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Truthout \nA month after President Obama told the Army Corps of Engineers to pause construction on the Dakota Access oil pipeline, the Standing Rock Sioux and those supporting them still find themselves in a dire struggle to protect their water and land. With winter approaching, the 300 tribes that are now represented at the Camp of the Sacred Stone in North Dakota are preparing for a lengthy battle. \nIn their effort to protect water, life, ancestors and future generations, indigenous peoples are also demanding that corporations, the US government, and settlers respect the treaties and indigenous self-determination. This is widening an existing dialogue and expanding ties of solidarity to include more of us who are of white European descent occupying indigenous land. \nAs support for those at Standing Rock grows, it is important that allies also confront the fundamental questions of what it means to live on stolen land and how to transform colonial relations in a way that creates a viable and just future for all communities and the planet. After almost a decade of engaging in request-based, volunteer solidarity organizing with indigenous groups fighting relocation in Black Mesa, Arizona due to coal mining , we have learned and honed a list of action steps for non-Native individuals just getting involved, as well as a set of best practices for activists already working on other organizing efforts. \nAs people of European descent who benefit from both white privilege and settler privilege, we understand that our work and writing is most effective when it is developing and acting upon a mutual stake in decolonization. This means focusing on the responsibilities specific to our position, which is inherently different from that of indigenous and non-Native people of color. Nevertheless, their organizing, along with much activist scholarship — some of which is linked to below — has helped inform this list of action steps and set of best practices. \n1. Know whose land you are on. There are plenty of resources out there to help you educate yourself about the land that you, your school or place of worship are occupying and its original inhabitants. Here is one . Find out if the tribes or nations are still in that area. If they are not, find out why. Have they been forcefully relocated or pushed out in another way? Acknowledge that you are on occupied land when you say where you are or where you are from. This is an important way to disrupt the myth of the “disappearing native.” \n2. Know your family’s history. How did your family end up in the United States? Was it through a colonial process in another country? If your ancestors are from a colonizing country, what was your family’s connection to land, spiritual traditions, economies, etc., before that country began colonizing other places? Does your family own land in the United States? If so, how did they come to acquire it? \n3. Learn together. Encourage learning that is personal, emotional, spiritual, embodied and communal. Host reading groups and discussions that build an understanding of settler colonialism and your community’s relationship to it that is tied to indigenous solidarity. Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz’s “An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States” is an enormously helpful place to start, and there are numerous resources, such as the book “Unsettling America,” the website for Black Mesa Indigenous Support, the Colors of Resistance archive , the journal Decolonization , the No One Is Illegal network , queer indigenous studies, critical indigenous studies and more. \n4. Ask permission. Asking permission fundamentally shifts the entitlement inherent to the settler experience. Cultural appropriation is an extension of genocide, forced removals, and land theft, as settlers take what does not belong to them as if it is rightfully theirs. This can be countered by asking permission to be on indigenous peoples’ traditional lands. This practice can be extended in a variety of ways and open up new modes of relating and relationships. As one of the first steps of planning, ask permission for any gatherings, marches, etc., from an indigenous representative of the land you are on. Invite them to collaborate in planning around gatherings, conferences, actions, and campaigns for justice work on their traditional homeland. Be open to the work shifting because of such collaboration. \n5. Know where your water, heat, electricity and other resources come from. Lands that were relegated to indigenous use under the reservation system often because of their perceived barrenness are now resource colonies for the settler state. Indigenous communities in the United States are among the hardest hit by the negative impacts of climate change because of the extractive projects and processing that take place on their lands. Coal mining and burning, uranium mining and copper mining are just a few of the extractive projects that leave toxic legacies for generations to come. The profit from extraction on Native lands is rarely returned to the community that has paid the cost in destruction of lands and sacred sites, damage to health, and devastation of local economies and lifeways. \n6. Take responsibility for Christian privilege/Doctrine of Discovery. If you’ve grown up in Christian culture, you may be unaware of all the ways that Christianity is culturally dominant in the United States. Work with your faith community to raise awareness about the violent legacy of Christian hegemony and move resources to shift power. If you are part of a Christian denomination that has not yet repudiated the Doctrine of Discovery — the theological justification for the theft of indigenous land — start or join a movement to do so. Challenge the notion that the settler church was divinely ordained within your church community. Start conversations about saints or lauded leaders of faith who were directly responsible for conquest. Learn how your church acquired its land and whose land it was originally. Learn the history of your denomination’s relationship to conquest. Consider that within Christian traditions there are built-in practices for atonement and reparations. Get creative with your spiritual community about what atonement and reparations might look like. If it is possible, try and connect with the indigenous tribe or nation in your area to work on this. \nThe Christian and Catholic Churches are incredibly well resourced not only in cash but also in land. Many, if not all, indigenous-led movements across Turtle Island — the indigenous term for North America — call for return of land to indigenous stewardship. How can the church leverage its many resources in solidarity with indigenous-led efforts for land return? There is a new project in California that is working for the return of urban land to indigenous stewardship. Could your church start a conversation about putting land in trust and working with a local indigenous group to steward it? \n7. Engage in local struggles and build relationships. There are ongoing indigenous-led struggles for land and self-determination taking place all over Turtle Island. Not all indigenous spaces and organizations are looking for outside support, but many are. Educate yourself on this history of the area and current struggles. Reach out and take principled and accountable action by centering relationships in your work. The work will often be request-based and/or take on various forms of asking for permission, seeking guidance and input. This is a nuanced dance of taking initiative while ensuring there is guidance and the work upholds, not undermines, community self-determination. Your participation in decision making and giving input should be determined by the indigenous people you work with and will depend on the specific goals. For example, an indigenous community addressing its own tribal government has different objectives and requests from non-Native people than if cross-community power is being built to challenge federal and or state policies, energy policy, corporate power, etc. \n8. Work for repatriations of land, upholding treaties, and funding Indigenous-led struggles and efforts for land return. This entails supporting Standing Rock, and other indigenous-led struggles in your region, building power to force the state to respect treaties, and doing creative fundraising campaigns like door knocking for reparations, as members of Resource Generation did in the Bay Area in solidarity with Poor Magazine’s “Stolen Land and Hoarded Resources Tour.” Read more here . \n*** \nWhile these are helpful tips for individuals entering the sphere of solidarity work, there are also things activists already engaged in other organizing efforts can do to amplify indigenous-led struggles or incorporate a decolonial analysis into their work. It begins with incorporating an analysis of settler colonialism into all of your organizing work. \nSettler colonialism is the kind of colonial control that exists in “settler states” like the United States, New Zealand, Australia, Israel/Palestine, Canada, Argentina and other countries. It incorporates elements of external colonialism — in which a colonizing power exports indigenous peoples (as slaves or laborers), resources, knowledge, plants, metals, and/or animals to increase the wealth of the colonizer — as well as internal colonialism — which is marked by the violent management of an underclass of people and lands within the “domestic” borders of the imperial nation. So, when Europeans began colonizing what is now known as the United States, settlers came for good — not just to take things and return to an imperial center based in Europe. This is why scholar Patrick Wolfe called settler colonialism a process of “destroying to replace.” It’s our responsibility as settlers to work to dismantle the settler colonial project. \nHere are our tips — based on research and experience — for how to do just that, while also continuing your organizing work in other areas. \nIf your primary area of organizing is around the environment, recognize that indigenous cultures and lifeways are deeply tied to land, and most contemporary indigenous-led struggles center around access to land or land return. If you engage in environmental work: Consider how the environmental framework of land (or wilderness) as separate from people is an inherently colonial mindset that pits environmentalists not only against labor but also indigenous people, whose lifeways are inseparable from land. \nIf you engage in climate justice work, recognize the ways that indigenous communities have been disproportionately impacted by extreme extraction and climate chaos, as well as how they are resisting. Globally, indigenous communities are living as frontline blockades against extreme extraction. \nIf you engage in anti-racist work, consider doing the work of understanding settler colonialism as a structure and logic distinct (although interlocking) that is defined in terms of self-determination rather than being solely rights-based. A stance of self-determination signifies that indigenous nations pre-date the existence of the United States and aren’t always looking for recognition from the colonizing force. Rights and “equality” frameworks are most often based on the idea of the individual as the social actor and view equality under the law for all individuals as the end goal. Many indigenous frameworks don’t fully fit this and are centered more on the ideas of the collective (nation, tribe, people), as opposed to the individual. They also prioritize responsibility (to land, and future generations) as opposed to rights. \nIf you engage in labor justice work, familiarize yourself with the history of exploitation of indigenous labor in this country and consider ways in which your work for just workplaces may invisibilize the original inhabitants of the land your workplace occupies. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz’s “An Indigenous People’s History of the United States” and Andrés Reséndez’s “The Other Slavery” are good places to start. \nIf you are involved in queer and trans organizing that isn’t yet connected to two spirit/Native queer and trans perspectives and movements, learn from and build with queer and/or Two Spirit Native organizers, cultural workers and scholars. Learn the history of non-Native (particularly white) LGBTQ appropriation of indigenous alternative sexualities, genders and kinship structures. The article “ Settler Homonationalism ” by Scott Morgensen is a great place to start. Envision and enact queer and trans liberation that is anti/decolonial. \nIf you engage in food justice, or permaculture, herbalism, building alternative economies, and more broadly alternatives to capitalist institutions and modes of organizing reproduction and social life, familiarize yourself with the existing alternatives indigenous people have maintained through surviving, resisting, adapting and decolonizing. Consider the potential for connecting your work to questions of land and unsettling settler desire. As Scott Morgensen explores in the essay “Unsettling Settler Desire,” the desire to replace Native peoples and inherit their land, lifeways, alternative economies, spiritualities, modes of kinship and sexuality runs deep in settler society and permeates various alternative and radical subcultures. These desires for connection to land and land-based practices are often seen as a much needed antidote to the disconnection inherent in settler society. If, however, these connections and practices aren’t cultivated in relationship to indigenous peoples’ struggles to maintain their connections, responsibilities and traditions, then the forms of connection settlers are fostering can replicate “settler desire” and further entrench colonialism. \nFor non-Native people, walking a path of decolonization is the work of envisioning and enacting reciprocal relationships. Through this we can be humbled. We hold discomfort, knowing it is part of our work and our process of rekindling our dignity and interconnectedness. We can work to stop violence and environmental degradation. We can organize to build our communities’ capacity for self-determination, while struggling alongside indigenous communities as they maintain their responsibility to their homelands and future generations. We can shift entitlement and the normalizing of theft, as well as the narrative of “disappearing Indians”— the dominant colonial story that says indigenous peoples, lands and lifeways are inevitably disappearing as part of the natural passing of time. It is the narrative that relegates all things indigenous to the realm of history. We can move away from Western, colonial modes of existing as we restore traditional economies and modes of relating, community to community and nation to nation. Moving towards decolonization allows us to reckon with the violence of our collective inheritance and commit to healing, restoring and transforming our present, so as to ensure that we have a viable and liberatory future. \nThis piece was reprinted by Truthout with permission or license.

The American taxpayers should be outraged by this! Let Pakistan empower its own people! Michelle Obama has been traveling all over the world with the Let Girls Learn initiative as her pet project. The only thing is that most of the places she s traveled to have a great track record with educating girls. It s just one big around the world vacation for Mooch compliments of the American taxpayer. Judicial Watch s Tom Fitton had this to say about the trip: The Obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades EUROPEAN VACATION: MOOCH RUNS UP A HUGE TAB COMPLIMENTS OF THE TAXPAYERS Could someone please remind this woman that America is BROKE! As public schools around the United States suffer through a perpetual financial crisis, the Obama administration commits a breathtaking $70 million to help educate girls in a terrorist nation known as Al Qaeda headquarters. It s part of the First Lady s initiative (Let Girls Learn) to educate and empower an estimated 62 million girls in third-world countries who are not in school. A noble cause indeed, but it s costing American taxpayers huge sums while kids especially minorities in this country struggle in schools that aren t adequately funded, according to public education advocates.  We know that countries with more girls in secondary school tend to have lower maternal mortality rates, lower infant mortality rates, lower rates of HIV/AIDS, and better child nutrition,  according to the initiative s website.  But too often, a girl who could change her world for the better is locked out of that future by the circumstances of her birth or the customs of her community.  So it s Uncle Sam to the rescue. The government of Pakistan, which is included in the State Department s Country Reports on Terrorism, will get the $70 million to promote education among 200,000 girls and young women age 10-19. The announcement was initially made during a White House event this month with the wife and daughter of Pakistan s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. The program will serve as a platform and catalyst for broader political and social commitment to strengthen girls  education and empowerment in Pakistan, according to a government announcement.  Young women in Pakistan face barriers and lack of access to education opportunities from an early age due to poverty, cultural norms, and geographic isolation,  the announcement states. The question remains; should American tax dollars go to this foreign education cause when public schools in this country have been hurting for years? Besides financial troubles, there s an epidemic of low-performing schools and dismal graduation rates around the country, especially in the nation s inner cities. They could probably use a few million to create programs that might help improve academic performance or perhaps empower needy students like the multi-million-dollar allocation is predicted to help empower girls in Pakistan. The public school district in the Obamas  own hometown of Chicago could use some extra cash. By Thanksgiving as many as 5,000 teachers could be laid off unless the 367,499-student district Chicago Public Schools gets a $500 million bailout from the state. A recent editorial in the area s mainstream newspaper says that it  has been a disastrous time for Chicago Public Schools.  The piece is accompanied by an illustration of a yellow school bus with  Corruption & Politics in our Schools  plastered across the side. Districts across the nation are in similar situations. In Detroit, Michigan the public school system has a $515 million debt and among the nation s worst performing students. Read more: Judicial Watch", "output": "0. Fake"}

With all these things going in his favor, with 50 days left until the election, you d think he would stick to staying on script.But, as always, he screws it up.Just hours after  denouncing  birtherism (and then falsely accusing the 2008 Clinton campaign of starting it), Trump delivered another off-color, off script speech in Miami where he (yet again) hinted at Hillary Clinton s assassination.After incorrectly claiming that Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment (which she can t do), Trump said: I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons. They should disarm. I think they should disarm immediately, what do you think, yes? Take their guns away, she doesn t want guns. Take them, let s see what happens to her. Take their guns away, okay. It will be very dangerous. And just like that, Trump basically called for an assassination of Hillary Clinton, and the basket of deplorables cheered like the rabid dogs they are.Just five weeks ago, Trump hinted that angry gun rights supporters could take matters into their own hands   assassinating Hillary Clinton   should she win the presidency: Hillary wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment. If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the Second Amendment people maybe there is, I don t know. After those comments were made, Trump received intense backlash from both the left and the right. Although his people maintain he was not advocating for assassination, but rather them getting out to vote, his campaign promised to stay on script the remainder of the race.Clearly they aren t following their own advice.Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head at a constituents  meeting   thus forcing her to resign from Congress   demanded Trump apologize and disavow his dangerous comments: In his more stable moments, Mr. Trump has said he regrets some of the ugly insults and dangerous threats he has leveled during the course of this campaign. We call on him to immediately renounce these comments, apologize to Hillary Clinton, and acknowledge that once again he has gone dangerously too far. If anyone knows the danger of stoking political violence, no matter how  innocent  it may seem, it s Gabrielle Giffords. Republicans, Independents, and weary Democrats should ask themselves: is this who they want representing them? A  man  who makes a casual reference to violence against Hillary Clinton?Any presidential candidate who is so cowardly he has to call on his opponent to essentially be assassinated should in no way even remotely be considered for the job. Perhaps Trump s secret service agents should have a word with the Republican candidate about jokes regarding death.When will the American people stand up and say  enough is enough.

You went on to say that the Clintons have a high body count. Do you believe that the Clintons really are killing people?’\nShe responded by saying: ‘You know, sometimes we look at patterns and we look at things that are happening and sometimes you can’t dismiss everything as a conspiracy.’\nWeinstein then asked Lahren if she was referring to the conspiracy theory held by some that the Clintons were somehow responsible for the death of Vince Foster, a close friend of the couple who was found dead in 1993 of what was later ruled to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n‘The list – I will let your listeners go on and look at some of these examples and they can decide for themselves,’ said Lahren.\n‘But there’s been some mysterious circumstances that have surrounded – we just saw, what with the DNC leaks and then what happened to a person that worked for the DNC that was in charge of that?’\nLahren was referring to the death of Seth Rich, who was murdered near his home in Washington DC this past July.\nSoon after, DailyMail.com learned that he was set to start working for Hillary’s campaign.\nWeinstein pointed out to Lahren that Rich’s parents said they do not suspect anything ‘suspicious,’ to which she replied: ‘Well, his family doesn’t want to be in a body bag either, Jamie.\n‘I have got to be honest with you.

The documents regarding the Obama travel expenses came in response to two Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests filed by Judicial Watch.To date, the Secret Service has not provided requested information, as required by FOIA, regarding security costs.Using the Air Force s official cost estimate of $206,337 per hour, the newly released records obtained by Judicial Watch show:Obama s February 14, 2015, golf outing to Palm Springs required a five-hour flight, costing taxpayers a total of $1,031,685. Transportation for Obama s February 19 day trip to Chicago cost taxpayers $619,011.00. Transportation for Obama s March 2015 fundraising trip to Los Angeles cost taxpayers $1,980,835.20. Obama s March 28, 2015, golf outing to Palm city required a 3.9-hour flight, costing taxpayers $804,870.30. In Palm Springs, Obama played golf at the luxurious Sunnylands country club, located on the former estate of the late ambassadors Walter and Leonore Annenberg. Obama reportedly spent the weekend on the exclusive, gated property, where he has twice stayed before.Obama s February trip to Chicago was billed by the White House as a non-political event to declare the Pullman Historic District a national monument. But, press reports indicated that the trip was heavily political. In a CNN story entitled,  Obama gives Emanuel re-election boost: President Barack Obama went to Chicago bearing gifts Thursday for his former chief of staff, Mayor Rahm Emanuel   But the day had all the trappings of a campaign   and Obama even made an unannounced stop at a Kenwood campaign office for Emanuel on his way out of town.  I m glad he s my mayor, and I m glad he s going to be my mayor for another four years,  Obama told volunteers.Obama s travel to California was solely to raise money for the Democratic National Committee and to show his support for fellow Democrats nationwide. His visit to Los Angeles began with an appearance on ABC s late night comedy program  Jimmy Kimmel Live,  and continued on to include a  roundtable discussion  fundraiser hosted at the Santa Monica home of ICM Partners cofounder Chris Silbermann and his wife Julia Franz. Guests paid up to $33,400 per couple for attendance, donations that will be used to aid DNC activities during the approaching 2016 election cycle. Obama s March 12 fundraising trip to Los Angeles was his 32nd fundraiser in L.A. County since he became president.In Palm City, Obama played golf at the  spectacular  Floridian National Golf Club, where members pay a $50,000 initiation fee and $15,000 in annual dues. According to the resort s website,  This stunning, yet formidable par 71 will certainly impress. At 7,114 yards, the 18-hole course offers perfectly manicured rolling fairways and greens, demanding hazards, breathtaking views of the St. Lucie River, and is surrounded by natural preserve and native wildlife. Taxpayers should be outraged that Barack Obama s wastes 4.4 million of their precious tax dollars on golf vacations and political fundraising,  said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  And to make matters worse, the Secret Service has simply refused to respond to our requests for documents about the security costs of these controversial trips. The Obama travel scandal is about abuse of office, abuse of the taxpayer, and contempt for the rule of law. Records released earlier this year by Judicial Watch showed that Michelle Obama s 2014 trip to China cost more than $360,000 in air transportation costs. Judicial Watch uncovered an expensive combination of trips by the Obamas to Africa and Honolulu, which cost taxpayers $15,885,585.30 in flight expenses. The single largest prior known expense for accommodations was for Michelle Obama s side-trip to Dublin, Ireland, during the 2013 G-8 conference in Belfast, when she and her entourage booked 30 rooms at the five-star Shelbourne Hotel, with the first lady staying in the 1500 square-foot Princess Grace suite at a cost of $3,500 a night. The total cost to taxpayers for the Obamas  Ireland trip was $7,921,638.66. To date, the known travel expenses of the Obamas and Vice President Joe Biden exceed $61million.

We know that many protesters were Soros funded and we also know that Donald Trump is not a racist.

He then blamed the media for choosing to  push this narrative. Zollinger s Facebook post linked to an article published by the American Thinker entitled Charlottesville and Its Aftermath: What if It Was a Setup, which claimed that Obama, George Soros and the mayor of Charlottesville were responsible for staging the violent chaos we saw play out in Charlottesville. The conflagration in Charlottesville is beginning to feel like a set-up, perhaps weeks or months in the planning,  the author of the article wrote.  We know that Obama and his inner circle have set up a war room in his D.C. home to plan and execute resistance to the Trump administration and his legislative agenda.

Therefore, I must inform you that your request for a major disaster declaration is denied,  Fugate wrote.Spokeswoman Erin Montgomery said Friday that the Hogan administration  is reviewing FEMA s response and will make a determination about the appropriate next steps, including a possible appeal. A disaster declaration would allow public agencies and residents affected by the unrest to seek reimbursement for related costs.City officials have reserved $20 million to cover direct costs, including overtime for police and firefighters, damage to city-owned property and repaying other jurisdictions for police and other assistance.Howard Libit, a spokesman for Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, said Friday that the city is working on an appeal. We re told we have 30 days to appeal,  he said.  We re working with the federal delegation and Obama administration officials to assess what we might do to become eligible for reimbursement. Henry J. Raymond, Baltimore s finance director, said in May that the city was covering the costs from its rainy-day fund but hoped for federal reimbursement of up to 75 percent of the costs.In his request for aid, Hogan had cited Baltimore s preliminary estimate that the rioting and looting in April and the five-night citywide curfew had an economic impact of $30.5 million. That included the loss of conventions, hospitality and leisure spending, and tourism from Orioles games that were closed to the public or moved to Florida.

Recipient Name => Street Scene Near Temple University, 2016 \nOver three days last week, at least 150 blacks attacked whites at random around TempleUniversity. Victims were surrounded, punched and kicked. Wallets and phones were stolen. Rocks were thrown at passing cars. When cops showed up, one was knocked from her bike and a police horse was even punched twice in the muzzle. \nMost of the assaults took place on Friday. On Saturday, Joe Lauletta, a father of one victim, reported on FaceBook : \nI spent last night in the ER at St. Mary’s HospitaI. I received a call from my daughter Christina after my sons football game. She was crying, I couldn’t understand her, my heart dropped, I became scared, I said what is the matter? Dad, I was jumped, I’m beat up pretty bad. Where r u? Temple, they stole my phone. We’re heading to the police station. I do not hear from her until she gets to her apartment. Rage is running through my mind the whole time. She said she is getting a ride home and wants to go to St. Mary’s. I find out that her and her 2 male friends where badly beaten by a group of 30-40 black teenagers on their way home from the Temple football game. This happened after they got off the subway at Broad and Cecil B Moore. These sick animals held her down and kicked and stomped on her repeatedly. Thank god, the people from the pizza place intervened. They arrested 2 people at the scene. I have not let Christina out of my sight, she is resting. Every part of her body is badly bruised, it makes me cry just thinking about it. No broken bones. If you have children at Temple, tell them to be careful. Please keep Christina Lauletta in your thoughts. \nCBS Philadelphia describes another victim’s ordeal: \nHe says around 9:30 Friday night he was leaving work when he saw what looked to be at least 200 juveniles walking in large groups.He said he overheard police saying the kids were playing the knockout game. \nHe says a juvenile around 10 years old started shouting obscenities at him and grabbed his phone out of his hand. The student says the juvenile then came back and threw the phone at him, striking him in the face. \nAround 15 minutes later, the student says he was walking with his girlfriend when they were approached by at least seven juveniles. The student says he went to hit the TemplePolice alert button when his girlfriend was struck by one of the juveniles. \nAs the student was chasing them away, he says he was struck in the face by a someone he estimates to be eight years old. \nThis is not new. In 2014, five black girls, aged 17, 15, 15, 15 and 14, committed three separate attacks on random white people at TempleUniversity. Struck across the face with a brick, a 19-year-old white student suffered a fractured jaw and nearly had her teeth knocked out. Her 15-year-old assailant, Zaria Estes , was given a 2 ½-6 year sentence. \nAcross America, gangs of blacks have beaten random people for decades, just for the sport of it. This cathartic recreation has been dubbed wilding, catch and wreck , knock out game or flash mob, and it can happen at parks, shopping malls, state fairs or even your living room. \nIn 2012, a mentally-handicapped woman was relaxing on her stoop in Chester, just outside Philadelphia, when she was attacked by six black teenaged girls. When the terrified woman tried to flee inside, they rushed into her living room to continue the savage beating . Had these girls not posted their exhilarating workout on FaceBook, they might never have been caught. \nA white bartender at my neighborhood dive was attacked, just outside her front door, by a group of black kids around 12 years old. After throwing a rock at her head and knocking her down, they kicked her a few times as she curled up on the ground, then they scattered. “Just like that, it was over. All I could do was go inside and cry.” \nNot surprisingly, the latest incident at TempleUniversity has received scant media attention. Though AP did cover it, it never pointed out that these were racial crimes. As usual, only “teens” are fingered, with their race not mentioned. Had mobs of whites attacked random blacks, the entire world would have known about it by now. \nLocally, a black writer editorializes in the Philadelphia Inquirer that gentrification is ultimately responsible. In “BehindTemple attacks, rage often comes with exclusion,” Solomon Jones explains : ORDER IT NOW \nIn a city where poverty is concentrated outside the universities, we can’t truly expect the poor to watch jobs and wealth and excess pass them by without any reaction at all. \nTo be sure, violence is the wrong response. And the kids who engaged in it will surely be prosecuted, as they should be. \nBut I believe those teens are expressing something that has long simmered beneath the surface. They are expressing the rage that comes with exclusion. They are expressing the hurt that comes with invisibility. They are engaged in the inevitable push and pull of change. \nTempleUniversity, my alma mater, has reached out to the community with scholarships for local youth, according to spokesman Ray Betzner. They’ve put reading programs in place, tutored high schoolers and even talked to their own students about respecting longtime community residents. But Temple would be wise to reach out into the community with an eye toward creating stronger relationships and greater opportunities for the young people who’ve been pushed aside by a generation of exclusionary development. \nThe community would be wise to reach back. \nSo these attackers are among “people who’ve been pushed aside by a generation of exclusionary development.” Like many urban universities, Temple is surrounded by black ghettos , but these are being gentrified thanks to a steady influx of white suburbanites and immigrants. \nIf you’re barely treading water, and your rent jacks up because of gentrification, you’ll be pissed too. Who wants to be evicted? Blacks, though, are always the victims, and never agents, of any neighborhood’s improvement. Why is that? \nIn Detroit, a post-apocalypse ghetto of burnt out houses, gutted factories and urban raccoons, Mexicans revived a section near downtown. Unlike the rest of Detroit, there are plenty of restaurants and shops in Mexicantown, and it’s perfectly safe to walk around. \nIf there were fewer Mexicans, blacks would have more jobs, obviously, so why are our borders wide open? In “ Race and Crime in America,” Ron Unz suggests that Hispanics are being imported to replace blacks. They can do the same jobs, sans mayhem. In 1992, East Palto had the highest murder rate in all of America. Then a transformation happened as Hispanics flooded in. Ron Unz: \nOver the last twenty years, the homicide rate in that small city dropped by 85%, with similar huge declines in other crime categories as well, thereby transforming a miserable ghetto into a pleasant working-class community, now featuring new office complexes, luxury hotels, and large regional shopping centers. Multi-billionaire Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife recently purchased a large $9 million home just a few hundred feet from the East Palo Alto border, a decision that would have been unthinkable during the early 1990s. \nThe more blacks there are in a neighborhood, the more crimes, the lower the housing values and the more dysfunctional the public schools, and everyone knows this, including, say, a fresh-off-the-boat immigrant from Mali or Bangladesh. Black maladaptation is only getting worse. \nWhat you have, then, is a group that will largely be excluded from better jobs, universities and housing. As long as the United States shall last, blacks will be an underclass. Their symbolic successes, as in having a half-black president, can’t gloss over the fact that the majority of them are barely afloat. \nThe in-state tuition for TempleUniversity is $15,688, and the school accepts 56% of its applicants. It’s reasonably priced and easy to get in. Only 13.1% of Temple students are black, however, in a city with 44.1% blacks. Before you charge racism, do consider what Walter Williams has to say : \nAmong high-school students who graduated in 2014 and took the ACT college readiness exam, here’s how various racial/ethnic groups fared when it came to meeting the ACT’s college readiness benchmarks in at least three of the four subjects: Asians, 57 percent; whites, 49 percent; Hispanics, 23 percent; and blacks, 11 percent. However, the college rates of enrollment of these groups were: Asians, 80 percent; whites, 69 percent; Hispanics, 60 percent; and blacks, 57 percent. \nThough all races are being admitted to college too liberally, blacks benefit the most, for only 1/5th of blacks in universities should even be there. Feeling out of place, blacks across the country are demanding separate dormitories. ORDER IT NOW \nBlacks are also given preferred treatment when it comes to government jobs and contracts, so the academy, state and media are all in their favor, yet their failures have only increased. \nIn Ethnic America , Thomas Sowell observes, “The [black] race as a whole has moved from a position of utter destitution—in money, knowledge, and rights—to a place alongside other groups emerging in the great struggles of life. None have had to come from so far back to join their fellow Americans.” \nHaving achieved not just civic equality but, at times, even favored treatment, blacks still often find themselves on the losing end of life’s struggles. If you dare to suggest that individual blacks should bear at least some responsibilities for their failures, however, you will be branded a racist. \nSo I’m a racist for writing this, Walter Williams is a racist for pointing out that most blacks attending college shouldn’t be there, and Joe Lauletta is a racist for calling his daughter’s attackers “sick animals.” Everyone is a racist except those 150+ blacks who attacked whites unprovoked. \nTo many black apologists, blacks can’t be guilty of anything, be it murder, rape, a brick across your face or even racism, because everything they do is just a response to relentless white racism. I’ll insist, though, that these black apologists are the worst racists of all, because to deny someone of moral agency is to reduce him to an animal. \nAs for the media, their steady suppression or excuse of black misbehavior is an encouragement of even worse. This has to be intentional. They’re enabling more riots, more catch and wrecks, more knock out games. \nTeaching in Germany, I showed my students the Philadelphia Police Department’s YouTube channel, without comments. One video after another had a black person assaulting or robbing somebody. When a Hispanic criminal suddenly appeared in the 9th video or so, some students couldn’t help but grin, for they were fleetingly spared of the monotony. \nSince the students wanted to learn about the US, I gave them an authentic, unedited glimpse. At their local cinema, Straight Out of Compton was playing. It’s very cool to act black in Germany . \nOf course, black apologists will claim that American blacks only rob because they’re oppressed and poor, though I don’t see how this explains the 22,000+ black-on-white rapes/sexual assaults reported yearly, as compared to zero white-on-black sexual attacks. (See table 42 of the Department of Justice’s Criminal Victimization in the United States reports for 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 and 2008 , the last year available.) Oh yes, white women are so fetishized, blacks can’t help but rape them. None of them can help doing anything, I get it. What a gross insult this is to decent blacks. \nAgain, to deny someone of moral agency is to reduce him to an animal. \nLinh Dinh is the author of two books of stories, five of poems, and a novel, Love Like Hate .

We’ve been pessimistic on the economy, on the social foundation of our country, our standing in the world, our concern over potential for war, our healthcare, our jobs and generally speaking… our future.\nFor some of you Barack Obama may be a likable character. While many of us believe he’s corrupt and wrong in his way of thinking, it’s understandable that many of his voters found him to be generally likable. For those who do, the truth is he betrayed you. He betrayed all of us.\nHis healthcare law was sold to you as a law that would make healthcare affordable and wouldn’t change the plan/doctor you have. Most of us are now finding that was a lie. We’re losing our plans and doctors, and costs are skyrocketing.\nHis economic policy enriched the mega rich while crushing jobs. His environmental policy has pumped billions of our dollars into the pockets of special interests, killed off jobs and did absolutely nothing for the environment. His tax policy is painful. If you pay taxes you know this to be the case.\nHe spends money like it grows on trees. For him it’s not an issue. He lives in the high castle and will never have to worry about money. But you and I? Yeah, it’s an issue.\nHe dragged us nearly into world war with Russia. He collapsed the Middle East in a way that has rippled across the globe.\nWe can disagree on issues, but surely we can agree this hasn’t been a good situation. Something has to change. Hillary Clinton wasn’t going to change anything. She was going to take Obama’s burning agenda and throw gasoline on it.\nWe now have an opportunity. Donald Trump has his flaws. We all have concerns about it. No secret there. But his plan is something we should all get excited about. That is, of course, provided he actually follows through with it.\nTrump is likely to relax tensions with Russia. He’s likely to pull back our nonsensical involvement in the Middle East. He’s likely to repeal and replace Obamacare. He’s likely to initiate a tax and economic policy that WILL invigorate business growth.\nFor businesses, Trump has a plan that will help create spenders. And for consumers his plan will help us earn and retain more financial stability.\nThis is a good thing. It’s good for liberals, conservatives and independents. It’s good for America.\nNot long ago there was a time when Americans were optimistic, hungry for success and excited to work hard for it. We’ve exiting a period of time where that mentality has been non-existent. We’re entering a time where it can exist again.\nWe’ve got a mess on our hands. There is much work to do to clean it up. But it can be cleaned up, and we can flourish as a result of it.\nThat is, if we unify and optimistically strive for success as a nation.\nIt’s time, America. It’s long overdue.\nLet’s make America great again.\n-Eric Odom", "output": "0. Fake"}

Can you tell me, how can you morally justify your support for this kind of candidate, somebody who could be very destructive to our country? Ryan couldn t actually give Marcone a moral justification for why he continued to support Trump even though he d condemned several of the Islamophobic things Trump has said in the past. Basically accepting Marcone s description of Trump as a racist Islamophobic candidate, Ryan s only response was that carrying out the Republican party s agenda was more important to him than protecting America.

You see the idea crystal clear, you know where you want to get, what you want to make real. You know, you feel what you have to do, how you need to do it in order to realize and manifest your plan. “Oh, this is a really great idea. If I implement this plan, then I will surely help others, and secure my living at the same time.”, the excitement bursts out from you. \nThe only extremely unpleasant thing is, that these peaks of feverish creativeness occur rather rarely. As your enthusiasm decreases, moderates, countless concerns fill you: “Oh, I am sure I am not able to do this. I am not good enough or skillful enough for this. I am afraid that I will fail.” – this is what you think and your dreams, which seemed to be so refreshing, exciting and radiant, begin to fade. What you thought was great, very important, now it just does not seem like that anymore. In fact, doubt gradually conquers you: “I am sure I cannot accomplish this!”. \nIn other cases, our plans may not necessarily be “world-changing”, just some smaller-scale idea, but this would be far enough for you to find happiness. Perhaps the planning of a flower bed, or organizing a trip would be just enough to get you all fired up and excited and make you want to completely engage in realizing it. But somehow, your excitement drops underway. You give up. \nOr maybe your boss forwards an email to you, which begins like this: “This is a creative task, suitable for you!”. You run your eyes through it and note it with disappointment: “This is a routine task, even a machine could do it.”. \nThe disappointment following the unrealized dreams remains in you every time: “I am doing my job, running around, I can barely breath anymore. I wanted to make real so many things, but I had no time for them. I am getting old, all the gates close in front of me.”. \nToo many conflicting thoughts attack us and they viciously demand attention: “Can I do this?”, “What am I going to do with the emerging obstacles?”, “Others failed in this, why would I succeed?” \nThere are those little selves in us, the egos, and they make us do strange things. They want to reach something very important, they project themselves into the future, celebrating the success of their not yet realized plans, they would like to be there in that moment as soon as they can, when everything functions perfectly – and while they daydream about the future or wallow in their doubts, they completely forget about the present moment. \nBut the only thing they should do, if they want to live, is to take the chances the present moment gives. \nYou can take those initial steps, which will slowly but surely take you to the realization of your dream, only here and now, never at any other time. Taking you closer and closer to the realized dream each day. The dreams and doubts take over the role of the leader, they fly you far into the future or the past, making you miss those opportunities that open up for you only right here, right now, in this moment. \nAnd this is really unpleasant. \nYou lose the grip on reality and drown in your dreams or nightmares. \nThe source of creativity is your inner quiet, intelligent consciousness that fully embraces and accepts the completeness of the present moment. \nCreativity, as a creating power, works like a rollercoaster: sometimes it acts in the heat of the feverish creative work, sometimes it turns silently inwards, drawing inspiration from the state of pure consciousness. \nLike Brahman of the Eastern legends, the only embodied spirit inside us: it dreams a world for itself sometimes, takes up the shapes of millions of forms, the shape of a rock, a grass blade, a tree, a kitten and your shape, it plays the roles of its life, then sheds this human skin and retires from the stage of life. When this happens, the world is destroyed and the sole consciousness turns back into its own emptiness, only to create other dreamworlds for the sake of its own amusement. \nCreate, then rest. Rest, then create. Be awakened, conscious. Live in the now, in the present moment. \nLive and enjoy existence, throw yourself into every experience. Be open and enter the game of life. Do! \nWhen you feel like you need to do something, just do it. \nDo it consciously, with your full attention focused on how you are doing what you do. \nDo not seek the future, do not harvest the fruits of the work done, but be there, where you are physically and mentally, and most importantly consciously, and watch how you do what you have to do. \nIf the idea that you want to realize is present in the space of your consciousness as a crystal clear picture, gently, vaguely affecting every thought and emotion, then you are able to see the dance of the forms clearly in the existence in the present moment, and also when they arrange into opportunities which are necessary to make your plans come to life. \n“Coincidences” happen, synchronicities. Something happens and you notice it with enthusiasm that this was just what you needed to proceed and go further, climbing more and more steps right until achieving your goal. Like the whole universe is helping you: the events occur when they should, new guides appear, the realization of your plan rapidly unfolds. \nYou consciously do what you have to do. \nIf you do not have to do anything or just feel like it, then retire for a while. Put down your to-do list and let yourself get into the quiet, peaceful, calm, relaxing contemplation, the sheer existence without deeds. Be! \nThose people who “slow down”, sometimes retire to passively recharge themselves, meditate – they do nothing – are still considered to be strange by the Western world. Many people feel that they can only have a good time if they suppress their troubles and concerns. But they ignore the fact that the person, who works day and night and gets lost in their thoughts, is exhausted, their performance is decreased, stressful and depressed. They are those who need it the most to take some time and rest in themselves. \nWhen the creative force lessens, its fire no longer burns with that lively flames, then it is advisable to switch into the “existence” mode. \nCompletely pause all your activities. Let go the compulsive feeling to do something: “I have been so good at this, I must be good at it now!”. \nGive in to resting in your body. \nStay in the inner silence and peace, contemplate calmly, let your eyes wander and discover things that are important for them. \nIf you want to, then take a walk in a peaceful, quiet environment of nature. Walk slowly, gracefully, consciously. \nFeel how relaxed and easy your steps are, and notice the beauty of nature. \nRelax in the space of consciousness. This is how you can recharge your creative energy. And as the desire to do something comes alive again and you feel its irresistible, blazing fire, do not hesitate, throw yourself back into action. Consciously and with joy again. Be, do, be, do! \nLife suddenly makes you face a complex exercise, a challenge awaits you, to which you do not know the solution. You speculate, think, your head buzzes, you go through the script of every possible scenario, but none of them satisfies you. You think “These solutions are not good and I do not see if there is a solution at all.”. \nYour mind examined every previously satisfying template in its arsenal: “Last time I did this and it helped me”, but it did not find a solution pattern in your memories that would come useful in this new situation. And after trying all the old “solution templates”, it has no aces left, it has a tendency to turn anxious or downbeat. It finds no escape from the trap of the problem. It gives up. \nWhen this happens, the time has come: it is time to retreat into the realm of the quiet inner peace. \nWe see the things and events in the state of pure consciousness as they really are, the cover of imaginations, glued to them by the mind, falls down. \nYou are an alert observer. \nYou sent your mind on a day-off, it does not have to mull on the problems it created. \nThings become clear in the state of pure consciousness. Nothing is dramatic anymore, things are just the way they really are. You discover the forms, events in the completeness of the moment, which could become tools that help you reach your goal. You notice how you have to alter the processes gently and smoothly, so that they help for you, but also for you fellows. \nRealizations are born in you. \nYou wisely understand the completeness of the moment. \nYou gain inspiration. \nAnd when you feel you need to do something, you do it. And as the present moment no longer needs your intervention, you return to the silent contemplation again. \nDo! Be! Do, then be again! Enter the creative-inspiring pulsing of life!", "output": "0.

No matter how outrageous his words or deeds,  Therefore, it comes as no surprise that during an appearance on ABC s This Week, Matt Schlapp, Chairman of the American Conservative Union actually suggested that Trump s chaotic excuse for governing the nation is actually helping move the GOP legislative agenda alone.First, former conservative radio host and #NeverTrump Republican Charlie Sykes was able to weigh in, saying: The role that the president is playing, rather than showing leadership of any kind, he is sowing chaos, confusion and destruction. Schlapp said in response: I get the fact that there s an opinion on Donald Trump that a lot of people don t like Donald Trump. The president does want to get it done but he wants to get it done within the context of the other aspects of these polices. So Dreamers are going to have to be accompanied with border security. And [Obamacare] CSR payments are going to have to be accompanied by other health care reforms. That s where the very outspoken Van Jones chimed in: You just described probably the most complicated set of negotiations in the history of the republic, that this guy is ramming through. Schlapp tried to cut Jones off, but Jones wasn t having it, and plowed on: I m not finished yet, I m not done. The problem you are having is what you are describing is something that would require real leadership, real finesse. On BOTH sides!  Schlapp desperately pouted.Jones calmly continued: I ll say on both sides. But your guy, who you are going to love and defend   I understand it s your job   you have to admit he s his own worst enemy. In order to do what you just described, you would need discipline and focus. That s when Jones really let the bomb drop: That this isn t normal, and Senator Bob Corker started openly questioning Trump s stability and fitness to serve. Jones said: We are so into the crazy now, when something significant happens, we don t notice. [Corker] is not a bomb thrower. And when someone of his stature and his temperament says World War III, that should be a all-cars-stop-on-the-interstate moment. What is going on? Van Jones is correct. This is a very dangerous situation, and Trump s cable news lackeys are enabling this playing of Russian Roulette with our lives and the future of the nation.

They are lurking in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. Young children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects our modern lifestyle creates. They can suffer profound and permanent adverse health effects which affect their developing brain and nervous system.A leading group of U.S. scientists, medical experts, and health organizations said that they are witnessing a dramatic increase in learning and behavioral issues in children. Therefore, they called for chemicals to be banned at the first sign of danger rather than waiting for direct, scientific proof.\"Our failures to protect children from harm underscore the urgent need for a better approach to developing and assessing scientific evidence and using it to make decisions,\" the experts said.Here are the top ten toxins that our kids are exposed to on a daily basis. 1. Mercury fillings Europe, Norway, and Sweden banned mercury-leaching amalgams nearly a decade ago. Nonetheless, dental offices across the U.S. continue to use these toxic substances in their everyday practice. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), exposure to high levels of mercury can cause lung damage, while prolonged low exposure may result in memory loss, neurological impairment, kidney abnormalities, and skin rashes. 2. Vaccines As stated by the National Vaccine Information Center , a typical child receives about 49 recommended doses of 14 toxin-laden vaccines before the age of six. Here's a short list of the most common toxic chemicals found in vaccines: formaldehyde (used to preserve dead things), mercury, aluminum (associated with Alzheimer's), GMO yeast, antibiotics, and monosodium glutamate (MSG). 3. Prescription drugs Overprescribing doctors, with close ties to the Big Pharma are a real treat when it comes to your child's safety. Writing for Blogs Natural News , Dr. Brent Hunter explained that some of these drugs are the legal versions of addictive street drugs. Take ADHD medication as an example. These commonly prescribed drugs are quite similar to drugs like meth and speed. 4. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) MSG is a common, artificial food additive with neurotoxic effects. It has been linked to numerous health problems like brain lesions, obesity, malformed organs, abnormal reproductive systems, infertility, aggression, antisocial behavior, and high cholesterol. 5. Processed and fast foods We all know that processed or fast foods are bad news . They are loaded with artificial synthetic chemicals, preservatives, nitrates and artificial colors and flavors which have been linked to a host of adverse health effects. 6. Toxins in personal care products When you read the label of personal care products such as body washes, moisturizers, deodorants, and toothpaste, you might not recognize most of their ingredients. When these chemicals seep into the skin, they can cause devastating, long-term effects. Opt for non-toxic, organic alternatives instead. 7. Toxins in Laundry detergent If your laundry detergent has a strong, nice fragrance, chances are it is packed with cancer-causing toxins. Some of these chemicals can be absorbed through your skin. 8. Toxic cleaning products \"Keep out of reach of children,\" is not an uncommon phrase on the label of cleaning products. While we all know that they can be harmful or fatal when swallowed, Dr. Brent Hunter said that we don't need to drink them to experience the damaging side-effects. These chemicals can also end up in our body through inhalation or contact with the skin. 9. Pesticides Pesticides are everywhere. They are in our home, the environment, and the food we eat. Opting for natural pest control and organic, homegrown foods is your best chance to avoid these toxins from entering your home. 10. Soda Sodas are loaded with phosphoric acid which weakens your child's bones and teeth. Furthermore, they contain high amounts of high fructose corn syrup that causes obesity and diabetes.

Weiner is estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin. The process has begun, said an FBI source to the New York Times.This comes after a Friday afternoon announcement by embattled FBI Director James Comey stating the agency intended to reopen the previously closed investigation into former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s long-running email scandal.21WIRE reported on Comey s shock announcement Friday, and also detailed a leaked  memo supplied to Fox News  indicating that there might be an internal upheaval within the FBI over botching the previous leg of the investigation and possibly caving into the political pressure from the White House and the DOJ to drop the case in order to preserve Hillary Clinton s presidential run.Since the FBI announcement, the Clinton campaign has gone into full damage control mode, while the Trump campaign has enjoyed a small surge which has cut into Clinton s lead across all national polls. All this happening less than 10 days before voters go to the polls on Nov 8th.Oddly, Clinton, a former lawyer, has publicly demanded that the FBI  release all the information, and let the public know exactly what they have,  even though this would be a violation of legal procedures in a criminal investigation.Nevada Senator Harry Reid (photo, left) issued an open letter/press release accusing director Comey of somehow being in violation of the Hatch Act by attempting to interfere with a US election, stating, I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act,  said Reid. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law,  he added.Congressman Trey Gowdy (SC-R), the Chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, was the first to discover Clinton s illegal email server during the initial Benghazi hearings. According to Gowdy, this latest move by the FBI could net an indictment due to possible evidence of a cover-up. Gowdy s reponse on FOX News to Reid s letter was stunning: Thank God he s leaving (office), is my initial reaction. My second reaction is, I did not know Mormons used drugs.

This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don’t work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. \nCongress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: \n1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. \n2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. \n3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn’t Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it. TRENDING ON 100% Fed Up", "output": "0. Fake"}

However, the authorities there aren’t ready to rest on their laurels, and they’ve decided to carry through a real revolution in their school system. \nFinnish officials want to remove school subjects from the curriculum. There will no longer be any classes in physics, math, literature, history, or geography. \nThe head of the Department of Education in Helsinki, Marjo Kyllonen, explained the changes: \n“There are schools that are teaching in the old-fashioned way which was of benefit in the beginning of the 1900s — but the needs are not the same, and we need something fit for the 21st century.“ \nInstead of individual subjects, students will study events and phenomena in an interdisciplinary format. For example, the Second World War will be examined from the perspective of history, geography, and math. And by taking the course ”Working in a Cafe,” students will absorb a whole body of knowledge about the English language, economics, and communication skills. \nThis system will be introduced for senior students, beginning at the age of 16. The general idea is that the students ought to choose for themselves which topic or phenomenon they want to study, bearing in mind their ambitions for the future and their capabilities. In this way, no student will have to pass through an entire course on physics or chemistry while all the time thinking to themselves “What do I need to know this for?” \nThe traditional format of teacher-pupil communication is also going to change. Students will no longer sit behind school desks and wait anxiously to be called upon to answer a question. Instead, they will work together in small groups to discuss problems. \nThe Finnish education system encourages collective work, which is why the changes will also affect teachers. The school reform will require a great deal of cooperation between teachers of different subjects. Around 70% of teachers in Helsinki have already undertaken preparatory work in line with the new system for presenting information, and, as a result, they’ll get a pay increase. \nThe changes are expected to be complete by 2020. \nWhat do you think about all these ideas?

The rich have gotten richer and the poor have only gotten poorer as the once mighty and prosperous American middle class is disappearing. The problem with the Republican Party over the past 30 years is they haven t   and I ll say, we haven t   developed a message that appeals to the working class Americans economically in a way that Donald Trump s does,  Scarborough said. We talk about cutting capital gains taxes that the 10,000 people that in the crowd cheering for Donald Trump, they are never going to get a capital gains cut because it doesn t apply. We talk about getting rid of the death tax. The death tax is not going to impact the 10,000 people in the crowd for Donald Trump. We talk about how great free trade deals are. Those free trade deals never trickle down to those 10,000 people in Donald Trump s rallies. And then the former Republican lawmaker actually flat-out admitted that trickle down hasn t worked. But herein lies the problem with the Republican Party. It never trickles down! Those people in Trump s crowds, those are all the ones that lost the jobs when they get moved to Mexico and elsewhere. The Republican donor class are the ones that got rich off of it because their capital moved overseas and they made higher profits What we re finding this year is, they ll even support a guy who says Planned Parenthood is good if he comes with an economic approach that they feel could actually help them more in the future. Here s the video via YouTube:And Scarborough is absolutely right. For decades, Republicans have told the American people that their economic concerns will be all taken care of as long as we eliminate taxes on the wealthy. But all that trickle down economics has caused is Americans losing their jobs overseas and they never see a dime of the wealth the GOP promised would trickle down upon them. It s like saying apples will fall from a tree if you just wait long enough but by the time one does fall it s rotten to the core and worthless. And that s if the tree doesn t just keep all the apples for itself like the wealthy are currently keeping all the money to themselves.The fact is that trickle down economics is a failed economic policy that needs to be ditched in favor of one that actually helps the American people. It s time for the rich to start paying their fair share and it s time for the middle class to rise again and take back the wealth that has been stolen by Republicans and their wealthy puppet masters.Featured image via screenshot", "output": "0.

It s about dividing a nation down racial lines and the good police men and women are just part of a scheme by the Left that is being orchestrated in the highest office of our nation Police investigating the fatal shooting of a six-year-old autistic boy by two Louisiana state marshals are looking into whether one of the cops had a grudge with the child s father.Jeremy Mardis was shot five times in the head and chest as he sat in the passenger seat of his father Chris Few s car last week by officers Derrick Stafford, 32, and Norris Greenhouse.Investigators are exploring the possibility that Greenhouse, 23, had a personal issue with Few, after Few s fianc e Megan Dixon said the marshal had been messaging her on Facebook and coming round to their home.Ms Dixon has previously said she  was the reason this all started , adding that she knew what happened in the moments leading up to the shooting.Few and Ms Dixon were drinking Budweisers and shots of tequila in T.J. s Lounge and pool bar that evening before getting into an argument, the Denver Post reported.She announced to the bar that they were not seeing each other any more and started dancing with one of the barmen.Few reportedly stormed out of the bar, kicking a door as he left, before getting into a blazing row with Ms Dixon in the parking lot.They drove off in different vehicles and someone called 911.A short while later, after Few had picked up Jeremy, he pulled up next to Ms Dixon at a red light and asked her to come home with him. She said she declined because she was  stubborn .As she pulled away, Ms Dixon said she saw two marshals  cars approaching from behind with their lights flashing.She said she saw Few was pointing at his son s head, showing that he was in the car and he wasn t sure what to do.According to investigators, Few drove down a cul-de-sac as marshals Greenhouse and Stafford came round the corner.Police say Few started reversing and at this point the men opened fire, pumping 18 bullets into the SUV, five of which hit Jeremy in the head and chest.Police are investigating whether Greenhouse (left) had a grudge with Few, who was said to have confronted the cop over Facebook messages and visit to his fiancee. Pictured right, StaffordFew s attorney says footage from a bodycam worn by one of the cops shows the father putting his hands up before the officers started firing.Col. Edmonson on Friday described the footage as  the most disturbing thing I ve seen .He added:  That video was incredible. I mean, as a father, much less head of the state police, I looked at that tape, I said this is incredibly disturbing.

Voting 91 to 3 last week, the Senate approved the revised bill, which includes $607 billion in defense spending as well as $5 billion in cuts. The bill then passed the U.S. House of Representatives. \nObama vetoed the previous version of the bill because it would have limited the transfer of detainees from the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to the United States. However, the new version of the bill retained provisions which will likely prevent Obama from keeping his promise to close Guantanamo. \nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said he expects the president to sign the bill, stating , “That certainly does not reflect a change in our position, or the intensity of our position, about the need to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.” \nObama also battled Republicans, not over limiting the military budget and focusing on domestic programs, but over whether they were raising defense spending limits high enough. When you look closer at Obama’s actions, you see he is actually voting in line with the rest of the war hawks. He is not demanding military budget cuts, nor that the United States begin winding down the global American empire. In fact, President Obama is simply asking for yet more money to continue to launch wars of aggression based on lies and fear. \nMany of you may remember that President Obama had no problem signing the NDAA 2012, which legalized the indefinite detention of American citizens suspected of ties to terrorism. It should be noted that the indefinite detention provision is still contained in the NDAA, and has been approved by Congress and signed by President Obama every year since it first passed. \nSo what’s hiding in the latest version? Sign up for the free Anti-Media newsletter the establishment doesn't want you to receive \nThe current edition of the NDAA will continue to ensure United States involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine by offering lethal aid to the Ukrainians fighting Russia in Crimea. Section 1250 of the Senate version , titled UKRAINE SECURITY ASSISTANCE INITIATIVE , and will authorize $300,000,000 to “provide appropriate security assistance and intelligence support, including training, equipment, and logistics support, supplies and services, to military and other security forces of the Government of Ukraine.” \nThat same section also grants funds for “Lethal assistance such as anti-armor weapon systems, mortars, crew-served weapons and ammunition, grenade launchers and ammunition, and small arms and ammunition.” Some of the weapons types the U.S. is offering to Ukraine include “Counter-artillery radars, including medium-range and long-range counter-artillery radars that can detect and locate long-range artillery, Unmanned aerial tactical surveillance systems and Cyber capabilities.” \nHowever, Ukraine will not be the only recipient of weapons funded by U.S. taxpayers. The U.S. Congress is happy to continue supporting conflict in Syria by funding so-called “moderate” rebels who are allegedly fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. All signs indicate the Syrian civil war has become another U.S.-led proxy war against Russia. \nSection 1225 of the Senate bill, titled MATTERS RELATING TO SUPPORT FOR THE VETTED SYRIAN OPPOSITION , allocates resources for logistical support including “Defensive supportive fire, Intelligence, and Medical support.” \nWhile the media focused on the battle between the White House and Republicans, it completely failed to mention that all current proposed versions of the 2016 NDAA will continue the proxy war between the United States and Russia — which could potentially accelerate the push towards outright conflict.", "output": "0.

In 1926 he was made Gauleiter, or party leader, for the region of Berlin, and in 1927 he founded and became editor of the official National Socialist periodical Der Angriff (The Attack). He was elected to the Reichstag, the German parliament, in 1928. By exploiting mob emotions and by employing all modern methods of propaganda Goebbels helped Hitler into power. His work as a propagandist materially aided Hitler s rise to power in 1933. When Hitler seized power in 1933, Goebbels was appointed Reichsminister for propaganda and national enlightenment. From then until his death, Goebbels used all media of education and communications to further Nazi propagandistic aims, instilling in the Germans the concept of their leader as a veritable god and of their destiny as the rulers of the world. In 1938 he became a member of the Hitler cabinet council. Late in World War II, in 1944, Hitler placed him in charge of total mobilization. As Reichsminister for Propaganda and National Enlightenment, Goebbels was given complete control over radio, press, cinema, and theater; later he also regimented all German culture. Goebbels placed his undeniable intelligence and his brilliant insight into mass psychology entirely at the service of his party. His most virulent propaganda was against the Jews. As a hypnotic orator he was second only to Hitler, and in his staging of mass meetings and parades he was unsurpassed. Utterly cynical, he seems to have believed only in the self-justification of power. He remained loyal to Hitler until the end. On May 1, 1945, as Soviet troops were storming Berlin, Goebbels committed suicide.Via: whale", "output": "0. Fake"}

But now, the AMA is fighting back, pledging to actively lobby Congress: With approximately 30,000 men, women and children dying each year at the barrel of a gun in elementary schools, movie theaters, workplaces, houses of worship and on live television, the United States faces a public health crisis of gun violence. Even as America faces a crisis unrivaled in any other developed country, the Congress prohibits the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from conducting the very research that would help us understand the problems associated with gun violence and determine how to reduce the high rate of firearm-related deaths and injuries. Thanks to GOP obstructionism, a lift on the CDC s investigation into gun violence was stalled when Senate Republicans blocked funding for the research. Stack stressed the importance of allowing such research, saying that figuring out why the epidemic continues is  vital so physicians and other health providers, law enforcement and society at large may be able to prevent injury, death and other harms to society resulting from firearms. And before the NRA nuts accuse the AMA of unconstitutional activism, it should be noted that the only stake the AMA has in this research is  the safety of firearms and their use, and reducing and preventing firearm violence. That s all there is to it. Doctors wanting to save lives? Wow, what a concept! These people aren t politicians, they re health advisors. And America s violent obsession with guns is a threat to the safety and health of everyone.This is the first time the American Medical Association has taken such a firm stance on a political issue on this magnitude.

But the election of Donald trump has apparently emboldened him to violate all sense of judicial ethics and human decency to warn new citizens that they better accept Trump as their president or else. I can assure you that whether you voted for him or you did not vote for him, if you are a citizen of the United States, he is your president,  Primono told the new citizens as they were forced to listen.  He will be your president, and if you do not like that, you need to go to another country. Here s the video via KENS.This is a pretty damn disgraceful thing to say to a group of people who clearly want to be Americans, especially from a federal judge.And Primono is paying the price for his partisanship because he was removed from presiding over any future citizenship ceremonies by the U.S. District judges.Of course, conservatives are very pleased and have made Primono their new hero, which alone should force him off the bench because it is clear that he is unable to exercise good judgement and political neutrality.But Primono claimed that he was merely offering a message of  unity  and that his remarks were taken out of context. I would never say anything like that,  Primono told KENS.  I wasn t trying to say anything for or against Donald Trump. I was just trying to say something hopeful and unifying, and unfortunately it was taken out of context. Yeah, that s complete bullshit. Telling new American citizens to support Trump or else is not  unifying.  It s a threatening message designed to scare immigrants into blindly following Trump.Immigrants should not have to deal with such threats in this country, where we have the right to political dissent. And the way Trump has treated immigrants over the last year and half makes it clear that he doesn t respect them. He hates them. So it s understandable that immigrants would be opposed to Trump s presidency. But they are not alone. Americans overwhelmingly voted against Donald Trump but he somehow won via the electoral vote. Millions of Americans are protesting against Trump and his bigotry.On a day when this group of diverse people finally became American citizens, this federal judge marred the ceremony by invoking the name of a divisive hatemonger and literally ordered them to accept Trump as their leader. It should never have happened but it makes one wonder how many more judges are going to become emboldened to behave similarly once Trump takes over in January.Featured image: Alex Wong/Getty Images", "output": "0.

He recently debated the most liberal hack economist on the planet and kicked his a$$:WATCH LYING LIBERAL ECONOMIST Get Hammered By TRUMP S Economic Advisor [Video]He questions the  Republican turncoats  on what they re doing to the conservative movement by not supporting Trump:I asked a successful businessman the other day what he thought about Donald Trump. He turned his thumb down. Wow. Are you going to vote for Hillary? I asked with trepidation.  Of course not,  he replied almost insulted by the question.  I understand the concept of a binary decision.  I got a similar response when I asked oil magnate T. Boone Pickens whether he would vote for Mr. Trump. He looked at me with a quizzical look on his face and replied:  Well, who else is there to vote for?  Right. Who else is there? Yet amazingly a caucus of lifelong Republican politicos in Washington are announcing to the world with defiance and self-righteousness that they will vote for Hillary Clinton. They are mostly former Romney and Bush operatives. They lost and now they want people to believe that their anti-Trumpism is an act of heroism and principle. They ingratiate themselves to The New York Times, The Washington Post and Team Clinton   the sworn enemies of free markets and conservative values. Somehow this doesn t offend their moral compass. I certainly don t mean to disparage conservatives who say they won t vote for Mr. Trump. One s vote is a matter of personal conscience. But to actively support Hillary is to put the other team s jersey on and then run a lap around the stadium. It s worth, because none of the arguments make much sense. First, many say that Trump can t win   it s hopeless. These are the same political geniuses who a year ago assured us that Mr. Trump could never win a primary (he won most of them), then that he couldn t win 50 percent of the vote (he did), then that he couldn t win 50 percent outside of New York (he did), then they said he couldn t win a majority of the delegates (he did)   On every occasion the Trump haters were wrong. How about a little humility since they are batting 0.00. The  Trump can t win  mantra isn t just wrong, it s subversive. Of course, he can win. He is running against Hillary Clinton for goodness sakes. So why do they say this? Because the never Trumpers want Trump to lose because he is to the political class (Republicans and Democrats) the disruptor that Uber is to taxicab drivers. Second is the complaint by some economists that Mr. Trump can t be supported because he is not for free trade. Longtime Washington insider Vin Weber reportedly recently said:  The world economic order and the Republican Party  would be  all in shambles  if Mr. Trump wins.  I think markets would collapse.  Really? Hillary Clinton flip flops every day on free trade, so why is it that only Mr. Trump would cause a recession? He doesn t get that the Trump movement is a revolt against the world order. Mr. Trump is calling for the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. He is for regulatory relief and school choice. Mr. Trump wants to kill Obamacare. Mr. Trump wants a pro-America drilling policy on energy. Hillary wants to soak the rich, increase the debt, stop energy development, expand entitlements and double down on Obamacare. How is this a difficult choice for a free marketeer? Third, the Trump haters say we must throw Mr. Trump over the bus in order to save the Senate and House majorities. This is a foolhardy strategy because one can t win without the other. As economist Donald Luskin puts it in his historical analysis of presidential races and Senate gains:  It is clear from history that the House and the Senate always move in the same party direction as the White House, and with the same magnitude. That means the presidential candidate is like a boat that congressional candidates are riding on. It s really stupid to torpedo that boat.   Finally, there is the view expressed by Bret Stephens, my former colleague at The Wall Street Journal, who wants to  make sure Trump is the biggest loser in presidential history  so that we can  rebuild the conservative movement.  Bret, if Obama/Hillary win a third straight presidential race, there won t be a conservative movement left to rebuild. The Republicans will move to the left. Worse, for President Obama to win effectively a third term will be a voter validation of all of the destructive policies of the last eight years. Do the  never Trumpers  want to facilitate that? Do they want to hand the left its greatest victory for liberal governance of all time? If they do, they, not Trump, are the unforgivable betrayers of conservative principles.

It’s a life most of us can never imagine while we’re paying our monthly bills. So what’s it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father? According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr.’s, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show star’s son wasn’t what one might imagine. Or, given Trump’s temperament, it might be exactly what you’d imagine. \nOn Facebook , Mekler told of the animosity Trump’s son had for this father. \n“I was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr.’s room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son’s door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,” he recalls. “There were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey.” \nThen Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. \n“Without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said “put on a suit and meet me outside,” and closed the door,” Melker wrote. \n“Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking,” he continued. “He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was “Diaper Don,” because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people’s beds and urinate.” “I always felt terrible for him,” he continued. \nMekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because “in light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country.” \nTo be clear, we are not demonizing Trump’s son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melker’s story is accurate or not, we’re not sure, but given Trump’s awful temper, it’s difficult to discount it. \nPhoto by Saul Loeb-Pool via Getty. Share this Article!

On March 30, 2015 — weeks before the explosive book Clinton Cash was released, and nearly a month before the New York Times published a 4,000 word story detailing the Uranium One transaction that multiple donors to the Clinton Foundation made millions from — Jose Fernandez wrote an email to Podesta in hopes that the pair could meet. \nOn April 17, Fernandez writes to Podesta, again, thanking him for their meeting and said, “I would like to do all I can to support Secretary Clinton, and would welcome your advice and help in steering me to the right persons in the campaign.” \nhttp://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/26/wikileaks-former-state-dept-official-coordinated-with-team-clinton-on-uranium-one-scandal-pushback/ If The Media Investigated Hillary Like They Did Watergate, We Wouldn’t Need WikiLeaks Today, mainstream publications have become willing accomplices in suppressing the same type of information they worked so tenaciously to expose all those years ago. \nIt has now been more than four decades since the Washington Post and New York Times led the charge to bring down Richard Nixon and his administration’s massive web of corruption and political subterfuge schemes.

Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, both reporters for the Washington Post at the time, unflinchingly pursued the complete truth behind the break-in. Little did they know that summer how vast was the network of lies and corruption their investigation would eventually uncover. \nThe editors at the Post initially put the story on the back burner, while the Nixon administration deftly stonewalled the reporters’ probes. By September, though, the Post and New York Times were fully on board with the investigation, and the administration had gone into full cover-up mode. Even though the FBI had confirmed that the administration had conducted a political sabotage conspiracy, it was not enough to keep Nixon from being reelected in a landslide in November. But the die was cast. The American press made it clear this story would not end until all the facts were in and Nixon and his henchmen were fully exposed. \nFast-forward to 2016. We are now two weeks away from the general election, and once again a potentially devastating story appears to be developing, related to a web of corruption and deceit that could eventually rival the Watergate scandal. Just like 1972, the Post and the Times are fully engaged. Except this time, the “two lions of journalism” have little interest in covering the avalanche of revelations pouring forth against the Clinton campaign. Instead, both publications are working around the clock to bring the Democratic nominee to power. That’s not all. Nearly every other mainstream media outlet in the country has jumped on the bandwagon. \nIt would be incorrect to think that until now the mainstream media has been a relatively objective source for news. This has been going on for a long time. Few could argue that back in the ’70s, editors Ben Bradlee at the Post and Abe Rosenthal at the Times were not absolutely salivating at the chance to bring Nixon down. But they achieved this objective in relentless pursuit of the facts, not the willing suppression of the same. \nOne would think, given the self-inflicted meltdown the Donald Trump camp finds itself in right now, the media might at least feign some level of balanced reporting, but they’ve made it very clear they’re not taking any chances. They’re going to keep digging dirt on Trump, and they’re going to continue to minimize, to the best of their ability, a story that may well have historic and damaging implications, both for the nation as a whole and our entire political system moving forward. \nAlthough this may prove to be a very successful political tactic for this year’s presidential election, it is likely to forever damage the reputation of mainstream American journalism, and it most certainly will continue to encourage the American public to look elsewhere for the unvarnished truth.

There’s a new kid on the block; her name is Crystalline, and she’s from the Hash Family. Crystalline hash is the latest craze in the hash community, and everyone wants a taste. The demand is so high that THC-A Crystalline is going for $200 a gram in southern California dispensaries . Testing in at an astonishing 99.9% THC, Crystalline is officially the strongest hash on the market. Other concentrates such as ice hash , rosin , and BHO range from 50-80% THC. Macro image of THC Crystalline. Photo courtesy of Allie Beckett. Cannabis concentrates are known for their variety of textures and forms, from shatter to wax to crumble, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. What many extract lovers don’t realize is that these various textures develop from the solvent used to make the concentrate and the methods of purging the solvent out of the final product. However, when THC is reduced to its purest state, it crystallizes, creating crystal ‘rocks’ which look very different than any other marijuana concentrate on the market. Crystalline turns many people off just because of its looks. The internet is filled with scornful reviews of its meth-like appearance, and this criticism is entirely valid. But don’t judge a book by its cover because cannabis crystalline is the purest form of THC and provides sufficient relief for many patients suffering from debilitating and fatal illnesses. And hey, it’s not THC’s fault that it’s a compound with a crystal structure. Guild Extracts, a Southern California extraction company, is the current leader of crystalline production. Their crystallizing process is kept under lock and key, but they claim the ability to make THC-A Crystalline out of any starting material ranging from hydrocarbon extract, CO2 extract, and ice water concentrate. One thing Guild Extracts has made clear is that they are not using a solvent to create this hash, rather, they are extracting pure THC from their starting materials. You may be wondering, what exactly is THC-A Crystalline? Well, before THC is combusted (lit on fire or vaporized) it sits in its raw acidic form, also known as THC-A. THC-A by itself is completely inactive, meaning if it is ingested it will not get you high (but it does have an extraordinary amount of medicinal benefits). When THC-A is activated through heat in a process called decarboxylation, the acidic carbon atom (the “A” in THC-A) is removed leaving behind the psychoactive THC that so many of us know and love. Macro image of THC Crystalline produced by Atom Labs. Photo courtesy of Allie Beckett. Now remember, this pure THC does not contain terpenes (the magical compounds that give cannabis strains their distinctive aroma and flavor profiles while contributing to their therapeutic effects). To make up for the lack of flavor, Guild Extracts has become famous for the “dip n dab,” dipping the crystalline concentrate into terpenes extracted from strains like Goji OG, Tangie, and Sherbert. While the sky-high potency may scare some away, Crystalline provides a surprisingly clean, focused, and inspired high. Plus, health nuts can rest easy knowing that THC-A Crystalline is completely free of any chemical inputs (think butane). source:", "output": "0. Fake"}

There's a very good reason for this plant's iridescent color. In the fading twilight on the rainforest floor, a plant's leaves glimmer iridescent blue. And now scientists know why. These exotic blue leaves pull more energy out of dim light than ordinary leaves because of an odd trick of quantum mechanics. A team of plant scientists led by Heather Whitney of the University of Bristol in the U.K. has just discovered the remarkable origin and purpose of the shiny cobalt leaves on the Malaysian tropical plant Begonia pavonina . The plant owes its glimmer to its peculiar machinery for photosynthesis, the process plants use to turn light into chemical energy. Strangely enough, these blue leaves can squeeze more energy out of the red-green light that reaches the eternally dim rainforest floor. Whitney and her colleagues describe the blue leaves today in the journal Nature Plants . \"It's actually quite brilliant. Plants have to cope with every obstacle that's thrown at them without running away. Here we see evidence of a plant that's actually evolved to physically manipulate the little light it receives,\" says Whitney, \"it's quite amazing, and was an absolutely surprising discovery.\" Slowing Down Light © Matthew Jacobs Begonia species adapted to deep-shade conditions display blue leaf iridescence, a striking form of structural color originating from specialized chloroplasts in the epidermis. These 'iridoplasts' contain highly-ordered grana whose arrangement enhances absorption Whitney and her colleagues made their fascinating discovery by working with a lab-grown crossbreed of two species of the the Begonia plant. The scientists couldn't simply use the native species found in the darkness of the Malaysian jungle, she says. It's absurdly delicate, grows slowly, and withers under anything less than perfect growing conditions. Instead, the scientists developed a much heartier breed that still sported the exotic blue leaves. The plant researchers then used an imaging tool called an electron microscope. Peering into the leaves' cellular structures, the scientists found that the plants had some peculiar chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are basically a plant's power generators—they're cellular capsules that hold all the machinery responsible conducting photosynthesis. In particular, Whitney and her colleagues noticed something funky with the spire-like structures called thylakoids found inside the chloroplast capsules. Thylakoids look like tiny towers, and the light that enters them is what's turned into chemical energy. Look inside the chloroplasts of most plants and you'd find these tower-like fairly randomly placed, like a slap-dash collection of buildings. But the thylakoids inside the Begonia's chloroplasts had a incredibly regular structure. Less like the irregular Manhattan skyline, and more like a planned city. According to Whitney, the rigid, precise structure of these thylakoids creates a couple of fascinating effects. First, their ordered placement means that the entire chloroplast capsules tend to reflect away blue wavelengths of light, which is why the leaves appear iridescent blue to our eyes. Losing this blue light isn't a problem for the Begonia plant's energy efficiency, since most blue light is absorbed by the rainforest growing above it anyway. Instead, the thylakoids are far better at absorbing red-green light, the flavor that tends to be most abundant in the perpetual dim of the rainforest floor. But here's the strangest quality of these cellular structures: Light itself actually slows down as it barrels through the Begonia plants' chloroplasts. That's due to the precise arrangement of the tower-like thylakoids, which together act like a dense crystal. While light always travels the same speed in a vacuum, it will slow down when passing through different types of matter. This effect is known in quantum physics as slow light . Combined with the increased uptake of red-green light, this effect increases the efficiency of the Begonia plant's photosynthesis up to 10 percent. Interestingly enough, Whitney says, the Begonia plants they studied had a mix of normal plant chloroplasts and the odd, highly ordered blue variety. \"We think these serve a function almost like a backup generator,\" she says, \"meaning the plant will use its [regular] chloroplasts if there's enough light, but can switch when the light levels get extremely low. \"It's just wonderful and logical to think that a plant has evolved an ability to physically manipulate the lighting around it in a variety of different ways. I think it really raises the prospect that this type of phenomenon might even be more widespread than we realize in the plant kingdom. Perhaps we just don't notice other plants that are doing this because they don't have a strange color.\"", "output": "0. Fake"}

Recipient Name Recipient Email => \nThe US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. Hillary Clinton, an agent for the Oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that the media and the political establishments of the political parties no longer have credibility with the American people. \nIt remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran. \nIt also remains to be seen how the Oligarchy will respond to Trump’s victory. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive, and they can use the crisis to force Trump to appoint one of their own as Secretary of the Treasury. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with Russia. Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government. \nWith Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment in his appointments and by obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington’s orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia’s border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end of Washington’s effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these imply the defeat of the US Oligarchy. Although Trump defeated Hillary, the Oligarchy still exists and is still powerful. \nTrump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks to his view, it means a big political change in Washington’s EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia of the current EU and NATO officials would have to cease. German Chancellor Merkel would have to change her spots or be replaced. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg would have to be dismissed. \nWe do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliar with the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopeful for the changes that now have a chance. \nIf the oligarchy is unable to control Trump and he is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding the financial sector politically accountable, Trump could be assassinated. \nTrump said that he will put Hillary in prison. He should first put her on trial for treason and war crimes along with all of the neoconservatives. That would clear the decks for peace with the other two major nuclear powers over whom the neoconservatives seek hegemony. Although the neoconservatives would still have contacts in the hidden deep state, it would make it difficult for the vermin to organize false flag operations or an assassination. Rogue elements in the military/security complex could still bring off an assassination, but without neocons in the government a coverup would be more difficult. \nTrump has more understanding and insight than his opponents realize. For a man such as Trump to risk acquiring so many powerful enemies and to risk his wealth and reputation, he had to have known that the people’s dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment meant he could be elected president. \nWe won’t know what to expect until we see who are the Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries. If it is the usual crowd, we will know Trump has been captured. \nA happy lasting result of the election is the complete discrediting of the US media. The media predicted an easy Hillary victory and even Democratic Party control of the US Senate. Even more important to the media’s loss of influence and credibility, despite the vicious media attack on Trump throughout the presidential primaries and presidential campaign, the media had no effect outside the Northeast and West coasts, the stomping grounds of the One Percent. The rest of the country ignored the media. \nI did not think the Oligarchy would allow Trump to win. However, it seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda. Assured that Hillary was the sure winner, they were unprepared to put into effect plans to steal the election. \nHillary is down, but not the Oligarchs. If Trump is advised to be conciliatory, to hold out his hand, and to take the establishment into his government, the American people will again be disappointed. In a country whose institutions have been so completely corrupted by the Oligarchy, it is difficult to achieve real change without bloodshed.

Similar to the Citizens United ballot measure voters approved Tuesday, it would begin as an advisory proposal to kick-start an arduous process. Marcus Ruiz Evans is the vice president of the group and s aid that Californians have a choice : \n“The reason that we’re here today is we wanted to point out to everybody in California that the American system is broken. It’s failing. It’s sinking. You as a Californian have a choice to make: Do you go down with that ship out of tradition or sail on your own?” \nTheir website states that Californians should follow Brexit’s lead: In our view, the United States of America represents so many things that conflict with Californian values, and our continued statehood means California will continue subsidizing the other states to our own detriment, and to the detriment of our children. However, this independence referendum is about more than California subsidizing other states of this country. It is about the right to self-determination and the concept of voluntary association, both of which are supported by constitutional and international law. In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the international community with their “Brexit” vote. Our “Calexit” referendum is about California joining the international community. You have a big decision to make. To add to Calexit’s momentum, an Oregon lawyer has joined the movement and filed the Oregon Secession Act , which has formally invited the states of California, Alaska, Washington, Hawaii and Nevada to secede with them and form a new nation together. The Act was filed by lawyer Jennifer Rollins and writer Christian Trejbal, who said that Oregonian values are no longer the values held by the rest of the United States and that joining with these other states to create a new nation “is a viable way to go forward.” However, just 24 hours after the Act was filed, they withdrew it due to the amount of violence they saw in the streets around the world. Trejbal said that they were receiving death threats and that their movement is not about violent protesting, so it was best to withdraw it at this time. Though Oregon has suspended their secession campaign for now, California’s campaign is growing stronger. With Texas speaking of secession just months ago, we now have the most populated state in the U.S. speaking of secession as well. Regardless of one’s political stance, it is clear to see that the people are growing restless and that something is going to have to give, and give soon. How do you see this playing out? Will California be able to secede and will other states join them? Will the U.S. Congress allow something like this to happen? Will revolution be the result?", "output": "0. Fake"}

While many of us would have preferred to see Gingrich take off the gloves with the hosts of The View, he chose instead to sit back and sling a few arrows on an  as needed  basis.The not-funny comedian Joy Behar attempted to paint Trump as a serial  liar  and was surprised when Gingrich shot back with, You mean like  you can keep your doctor, you can keep your insurance ? You want to talk about lies by a president?  Behar responded by attempting to convince Gingrich that Barack Obama didn t lie when he told one of his most famous lies to the American people, and that it was simply a  misjudgment  on his part.Near the end of the interview, Whoopi Goldberg went through a list of questions she used to vet Gingrich and prove how credible he was based on his answers. When the subject of the popularity of President Trump came up in the discussion, Gingrich confessed that he was shocked at how well Trump was doing considering a recent Harvard study that showed 93% of the post-election coverage of President Trump was negative coverage.

Over 2.4 million hungry Americans 60 years of age and older directly benefit from the program.And getting a meal in their bellies is not the only benefit Meals On Wheels provides.According to a research study, the Meals On Wheels program:Improved mental health, specifically decreases in depression and anxietyImproved physical healthReduced likelihood of fallsReduced feelings of isolation and lonelinessLess worry about being able to remain living at homeIncreased feelings of safetyA higher likelihood of eating healthyBasically, Meals On Wheels volunteers serve as a check on the health and well-being of vulnerable senior citizens. They ve literally saved lives.But if Trump has his way, millions of seniors are going to starve and lose all of the other benefits associated with Meals On Wheels.Trump is planning to gut the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, which includes Meals On Wheels as part of his heartless plan to increase defense spending. As we should all know, the United States spends more on defense than anyone else in the world and could cut spending in half and still be number one.That defense spending includes $3 billion a year for Israel. So while senior citizens are starving in America, Israel will continue ripping off American taxpayers in their bid to commit genocide against Muslims.Trump is also taking aim at the Food for Peace Program, which is  a State Department program that distributes food assistance in emergencies such as famine and natural disaster, and does some non-emergency food relief. This particular program plays a critical role in American diplomacy because our humanitarian efforts help build American prestige and respect throughout the world.By eliminating these programs, Trump is clearly sending a message to everyone inside and outside our borders that he does not care whether you starve to death or not.And that includes people who voted for Trump, since Trump won the vote of those 65 an older eight points in 2016. Looks like Trump voters are getting screwed again.Meals On Wheels is already struggling as it is to provide meals for the 2.4 million people they currently serve. But as Meal On Wheels explains, the senior citizen population is exploding and hunger is going to get worse.The reality is, more than 10 million seniors in America struggle with hunger, 15.2 million live in isolation and 18.4 million live in or near poverty. And, this problem will only become more serious as the senior population is projected to double by 2050. Families are spread out and elders are left behind, often as they struggle to remain able to take care of themselves.That means Trump is only making hunger in America worse by cutting this program. He should be ashamed of himself, and Republicans should be ashamed as well. Because they can t seriously call themselves  Christians  and not support programs that feed the hungry.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images", "output": "0. Fake"}

Mark Ames via e-mail: \nWhat we learned even in the 90s—there are never, ever any standards for a journalist writing about Russia. Ever. The more bigoted and fantastical, the better. And when your hack crap is completely 100% debunked by other revelations, no editor will ever, ever discipline you. The only way you can have problems with Russia journalism is if you step away from the herd. No editor will ever forgive you for it. \nAnd John Helmer debunked it more specifically by e-mail. Since his message was long, some key bits: \nMy wife is linked to Putin – she’s Russian. I’m linked to Putin – his friend Oleg Deripaska tried to kill me. \nFridman is busy exiting from Russia as fast as he can go – and may lose Vimpelcom Russia in consequence. The recent DoJ corruption penalty for Vimpelcom — $795M – indicates a reasonable lack of fondness on his part for the current US administration, but then Fridman has hired Richard Burt (Reagan-Bush) and Tom McLarty (Clinton) to “advise” – meaning lobby for him to get approvals from the Treasury, State and CIA for takeovers of fresh US assets, such as FreedomPop. And they are going through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, so the Trump “connection” can’t be as bad as the Clintonites make out. \nBurt and McLarty are advisors to the LetterOne board, not directors on the Alfa Bank board. If Burt is considered a Trump man – e.g., , http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-campaign-lobbyist-russian-pipeline-229264 — how to explain he was vintage Reagan and Bush? I remember Burt well – short, narcissistic (adolescent acne the cause), not very bright, would do anything to please, especially for money: http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-campaign-lobbyist-russian-pipeline-229264 If Burt is such a Trumpie, and McLarty a Clintonite, what happens when they want to use the office toilet at the same time? And then John Negroponte arrives, hustled by Stu Eizenstat (ex Carter) – does ideology get in their way, or do their money interests encourage them to form an orderly line? Look at this list of McLarty’s associates: http://maglobal.com/about-us/our-team/john-negroponte / \nAnd another desperate story at Slate, which I cringe at dignifying by linking to it: Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia? I hate having to attack this garbage; recall Glenn Greenwald saying how he despised Trump yet excoriating the MSM going all in running any and every fact-challenged or badly stretched attack on Trump, when there is plenty of bona-fide dirt on him already. Outsourcing this again to Ames who has seen more of this than I have: \nThe super-secret server linkup is one of the most inane supermarket spy pulp fantasies I’ve seen. It’s cartoon-bad. Most conspiracy theorists work a lot harder on their inane inventions than this. It relies on total ignorance, on a cartoonish grasp of how linkups would work. \nAnd Helmer again: \nA computer channel to a bank that doesn’t do the one thing banks are meant to do – transfer money. In the forensics of sex crimes, is that one of those Jimmy Carter “adulteries in the mind”? \nFT endorsement: For all her weaknesses, Clinton is the best hope Financial Times. Surprising amount of opposition in the comments section (as in lots) given reader demographics. And the US is now the FT’s biggest market. \nDonald Trump Used Legally Dubious Method to Avoid Paying Taxes New York Times. Par for the course for the New York Times. Article hyperventilates about supposedly improper behavior by Trump, yet the basis for the case is that what he did was later made impermissible. I deducted interest I paid on my one little student loan in the early 1980s because prior to the 1986 Tax Reform Act, all consumer interest was tax deductible. By the standards of the Times’ fulminating, what I did then was similarly “legally dubious.” Help me. \nOn top of that, from what I infer from this piece, which is not at all clear on what Trump supposedly did (it tries to make his sin about failure to report, which sounds like a stretch; the IRS does have audit powers), it still appears that Lee Sheppard’s analysis of why what Trump did in 1995 was kosher then but not kosher later is the best account to date. And that was out a full month ago. Her article specifically discussed why the cancellation of debt income did not appear on his tax return at the time. I am putting the key part of her discussion (it was unpaywalled for weeks but now Tax Analysts has hidden it again) at the very end of this post so the geeky can see what a stretch the Times’ treatment is.", "output": "0.

And then my mind drifts to Hillary and Benghazi The Obama administration is emptying the military s Guantanamo Bay detention facility of avowed terrorists captured fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but several American service members languish in another military prison for actions on those same battlefields that their supporters say merit clemency, if not gratitude.Among the prison population at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas, are remaining members of the so-called  Leavenworth 10,  convicted service members doing terms ranging from 10 to 40 years for heat-of-the-battle decisions their supporters say saved American lives.[quote_box_center] The very people who protect our freedoms and liberties are having their own freedoms and liberties taken away,  said retired U.S. Army Col. Allen West, a former congressman and political commentator.  I think it s appalling and no one is talking about this issue. [/quote_box_center]The  Leavenworth 10  is the name given to a fluctuating number of men housed at Leavenworth for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that their supporters say were justified. Over the years, a handful have been paroled, and more have been incarcerated.Among the more well-known cases is that of Army First Lt. Clint Lorance, who is serving a 20-year sentence for ordering his men to shoot two suspected Taliban scouts in July 2012 in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. Lorance had just taken command of the platoon after the prior leader and several others were killed days before. The Taliban suspects were on motorcycles and matched descriptions given by a pilot who flew over the area earlier and spotted them as scouts.A Facebook page devoted to Lorance s case has drawn more than 12,000 likes, and supporters have launched a website, FreeClintLorance.com, dedicated to winning his release. A WhiteHouse.gov petition calling for Lorance to be pardoned garnered nearly 125,000 signatures, but the White House has not taken action.Critics say Lorance was given a military trial, and his conviction was based in large part on the testimony of men serving under him.It was September of 2010 when Sgt. Derrick Miller of Maryland, on a combat mission in a Taliban-held area of Afghanistan, was warned the unit s base had been penetrated. An Afghan suspected of being an enemy combatant was brought to Miller for interrogation and wound up dead. Miller claimed the suspect tried to grab his gun and that he shot him in self-defense. But he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.U.S. Army Master Sgt. John Hatley   a highly decorated, 20-year vet who served in Operation Desert Storm and did another three tours during the Iraq War   also is serving a life sentence at Leavenworth. His conviction stems from an April, 2007, incident in Iraq in which he and his unit captured enemies following a firefight. He radioed a U.S. detention facility to notify officials he was bringing in four prisoners, but was ordered to let them go, according to his legal team.Two years later, a sergeant who had served with Hatley, Jesse Cunningham, was facing charges for assaulting another officer and falling asleep at his post. As leverage for a plea deal, he told investigators that Hatley and two other officers had taken the insurgents to a remote location, blindfolded them and shot each in the back of the head. He claimed their bodies were dumped in a canal, though none was ever found.Hatley, now 47, insists he and his men let the insurgents go, but believes he was punished in the interest of the government s relations with Baghdad. When concerns over appeasing a foreign country are allowed to interfere with justice for the purpose of the U.S. government or the military demonstrating that we, the military or the U.S. government will hold our soldiers accountable using a fatally flawed military judicial system, it doesn t matter what the truth is; it matters only that there is only the appearance of the truth,  he wrote in a message to supporters posted on freeJohnHatley.com.Law experts say military service members face a daunting task once accused of committing crimes in the heat of war. Killing on the battlefield is not the same as [a police officer] killing someone on the streets,  Dan Conway, an attorney who specializes in military law, told FoxNews.com.  When a cop uses force, there s a line of duty investigation. When a soldier uses force, it is investigated as criminal, and non-infantry investigators handle the case, many who have no combat experience. If you had experts handling the investigation, you d have much more balance,  he added.While the military rightly holds its soldiers to a high standard of justice, detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay have been freed even with no mitigating circumstances or reasonable belief of rehabilitation. The release of Gitmo detainees began during the presidency of George W. Bush in 2005 when nearly 200 detainees were released before any tribunals were held.According to a March 2015 memo released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, of the 647 detainees transferred or released, 17.9 percent were confirmed of re-engaging in extremist activity with another 10.7 percent suspected of doing the same.

Exclusive: Jane Chastain explains impact of Dems' 'living wage' proposal Published: 49 mins ago About | | Archive Jane Chastain is a Southern California-based broadcaster, author and political commentator. Despite her present emphasis on politics, Jane always will be remembered as the nation's first female TV sportscaster, spending 17 years on the sports beat. Jane blogs at JaneChastain.com. She is a pilot who lives on a private runway. Print \nOur country is at a crossroads. Never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road. One road, the one favored by politician Hillary Clinton and her Democratic colleagues, promises to lead us to a socialist utopia. The other, favored by businessman Donald Trump and some of his Republican colleagues, promises to get us back on the road toward free-market capitalism. \nIt is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system. In this system they control the lion’s share of our money and, in turn, hand out favors. In this system, they make the major decisions that affect our lives. As the government accumulates more and more power, we invariably end up with less. Statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power, the more of our hard-earned money he or she spends. Yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again, expecting a different result. \nWe’ve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time, and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the free-market system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world. No, it isn’t perfect, but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life. \nNotice what I didn’t say is “simply willing to work hard.” There is the belief by some that if you simply work hard, you should have what these politicians now call a “living wage” – the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs, which is around $85,000 a year in some parts of the country. The Democrats want to replace the minimum wage, which is a training wage, with this living wage. That completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder Americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently. \nIdeally, it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility, and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does. \nUnfortunately, this so-called living wage will destroy jobs. It will cause companies to automate, and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate. \nBut this living wage is only part of what the Democrats want to do in the name of fairness. \nThis, no doubt, appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope, so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better. \nWages have remained flat for far too long, but the Democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators. \nMost people simply do not understand that businesses don’t pay taxes. They are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices. And when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high, such as we’ve seen in Obamacare, there is a large outcry. That’s when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services. That’s when the door to socialism/communism slams shut. \nThey tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear. Our benevolent government will take care of us. They are offering us free college – or almost free loans – in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve. And if we don’t get that job, the government is going to give us free health care, free food and free housing. Under President Hillary, there will be free child care, free preschool and paid family leave. What a country! \nIf we don’t reach our goals, everything will be OK because Social Security and Medicare will be there to finance our retirement, and if that isn’t enough, the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television. \nWhat about the fact that Social Security and Medicare are going broke? How long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses? They never talk about that. \nAs British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said, “The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.” \nDon’t be fooled: This election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket. It’s an important fork in the road: One fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom. The other offers a free lunch. \nMedia wishing to interview Jane Chastain, please contact .

Unless we all find a way to stand together and stop Barack Obama and the Democrat party s fundamental transformation from happening we ll be looking for another country who cares more about its citizens than its immigrant population This is the last post on this blog. I am leaving Sweden for good shortly, and will no longer be following its descent from what was once the third most prosperous country in the world. Frankly, it s just too damn depressing.I was born and raised in Sweden, which leaves a cultural mark even though I moved to USA in the 1990s and have spent the better part of my adult life as an American. Coming back for a few years has been a shocking experience.When I was a child, Sweden was a dull yet very safe place to live. Yes, there was a heavy blanket of socialism and collectivist values covering everything, but there was a core of pragmatism beneath the redness. The intention and goal was always to benefit the citizens, even though they went about things in a backwards manner.Prime minister L fven Today, it s as if the inmates are running the asylum. The politicians are participating in a chicken race of  goodness  where everybody tries to one-up each other in caring for the citizens of OTHER countries while Swedish retirees, school children, handicapped and other vulnerable categories of people are thorougly ignored. Violence is exploding. Jihadist Trojan horses are flowing through the porous border along with the tens of thousands ID-less refugees.But what makes me the most pessimistic about Sweden s future is how the social fabric itself has been undermined.Now, to be clear, it is my opinion that modest immigration is healthy for society and beneficial for trade, cultural development and so forth. Protectionism as a concept is counter-productive, while free trade and the ability for skilled labor to go where they re in demand is beneficial for everyone.Having said that, what Sweden is doing is something completely different. The once homogenous population has been forever altered by a rapid and massive addition of people from vastly different cultures and value-systems. 26,8% of the population is now foreign-born or with at least one foreign-born parent, and the national census bureau estimates that some 150 000 per year will arrive to the country of just 9,8 million residents.There simply is no possible way to absorb and assimilate such volumes of people, period. Then you are merely creating ethnic enclaves, which due to incompatible language, culture and job skills become ghettos, which in turns brews crime, misery and extremism. Once the inflow has exceeded the capacity for absorbtion, further immigration only makes the problem worse.It s like someone having read that a cup of green tea per day is healthy, so they make it a policy to chug four gallons per day, every day. It s a good thing overdone to the extreme until it becomes toxic.Then you have the Swedish school system. There really is no nice way to put it; it s a complete disaster. The minister of education is a man-boy who spends his time making Youtube-videos showing heart-signs with his hands to boost school results, while university-level students can t read and comprehend the course literature.Education minister Gustav FridolinSince there is a delay in the changes in the school system, it is only in recent years the full impact of the knowledge-averse  progressive  school system is starting to be felt. Hard facts are largely irrelevant; the important thing is to sit in a group and discuss things until a consensus is reached. But with no hard facts to base the conclusions on, it becomes an exercise in futility because it s all random assumptions and opinions. As a university-level history student (!) was quoted as saying in newspaper Svenska Dagbladet the other day:  Why would all these dates matter? Who cares in what order things happened? That s not exactly fertile soil for creating the researchers and engineers of the future.Financially, Sweden is an oddity in that it never had its real estate correction when Lehman Bros went belly-up and the housing market everywhere in the West crashed. Sweden just kept steaming ahead, which means housing is ridiculously overinflated. In Stockholm, the real estate prices increased 19% and in Gothenburg 24% in the last 12 months alone   from an already sky-high level.Tear-down abandoned house from 1932 with small, unremarkable lot in the outskirts of Stockholm. Current bid: 7,5 million SEK, or close to $900,000.As a result, personal debt of the Swedish population is at an all-time high. To keep all this afloat the normal mortgage interest rates are at 2% with central bank Riksbanken at -0,25%, and yet a significant portion of the borrowers are hanging by a thread. If and when foreign banks and investors decide it s time to turn their backs on Sweden (as happened in the early 1990s) there s going to be a lot of pain.Then you have the financial obligations going forward. Like much of the western world, there is a demographic change where fewer tax-paying adults are to support a glut of retirees. What makes it especially dire for Sweden is that in addition to the old Swedes, there s also a ton of elderly immigrants that are granted  family visas  based on younger relatives having been granted asylum. They ve never paid a dime in taxes, yet enter the system with full benefits from day one. In theory, this would be made up for by the younger relatives working and paying taxes. Sadly, this is not the case; while ethnical Swedes have a 82% employment rate, immigrants only have 57% with non-Europeans coming in at just 51%.If Sweden was a person, it d be like the guy with three mortgages, seven maxed-out credit cards and four collection agencies chasing him that just signed a lease for a brand new BMW X6. Simply put, there s a lot of red ink in the future; it just hasn t been fully realized yet.Finally, there s the sorry state of the Swedish defense. After decades of constant slashing of the defense budget, the extent of Swedish ambition is to stall an invader for a week in a limited area. This with war raging in Europe, Russian missiles pointed at Sweden in Kaliningrad, and Russian submarines and bomber jets openly thumbing their nose at Sweden as they intrude on Swedish territory on a regular basis. The power vacuum in Scandinavia is so tangible you can almost hear a sucking sound as you fly over it. This, too, will require massive investments when the penny finally drops amongst Swedish politicians.So while I can t claim to be any kind of authority on macroeconomics or social predictive models, I see red lights across the board.In some ways, I d compare the country to a farm. Previously, Sweden acted like a sensible farmer and planted wheat here, carrots there, potatoes over there et cetera, by implementing free schooling, sound infrastructure investments, state-financed research and so forth. A few decades later, they reaped the rewards and climbed the prosperity ladder.In the late 1960s, this pragmatic line was abandoned as leftist idealist Olof Palme took over. But there was plenty to harvest from previous years, so Sweden continued to be the land of milk and honey for a good long while. Then things started drying up, and the process has been one of gradual erosion and decline since the 1990s.The famous Swedish health care system is a good example. 120 000 hospital beds in the late 1960s became 20 000 today. Cancer patients are put on waiting lists for months. Entire emergency wards shut down for summer. The crumbling Swedish railroad system is another symptom I examined in-depth last year. The aforementioned defense that now consist of about three fat generals and a rusty rifle (bullets withheld for budgetary reasons).A sensible farmer would see the problems for what they are and hurry to plant new seeds, so as to return to bountiful harvests of wheat, carrots, potatoes etc. Instead, the Swedish politicians goes by dogma and plants what they think SHOULD grow. So they plant M & Ms, hot dogs and pretzels. The results won t be fully evident for a few years yet, but as the last reserves of the old harvests are depleted, things will get  Interesting.From what I can see, there simply is no plausible scenario where these social tensions and future financial committments will not lead to a downward spiral of hardship and strife. I hope I m wrong. I really do, because I have friends and family I care about that will remain here to see it all play out.But I won t. I ll be back in the US being mad at Obama for being a lying scumbag. And if Trump manages to get elected in 2016? Whoo boy. A racist ignoramus who takes pride in the worst qualities of a cranky eight-year old should make George  Dumbo  Bush seem like Abe Lincoln by comparison. So every country has its problems. USA has its corrupt yokel in office, just as Sweden has Stefan L fven. Via: The Sweden Report", "output": "0. Fake"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: 21st Century Wire says In previous articles, 21WIRE has consistently raised the question of whether or not the CIA and the Pentagon have been using Hollywood celebrities as soft power pawns in order to help grease foreign policy objects over seas. This charge has always been met by narrow mainstream minds as a  conspiracy theory    even though we have provided evidence which indicates this is a very real practice, and one with historic precedents. Seems that the mainstream claim that  the CIA wouldn t hire someone like that  won t fly anymore.  We have talked about Dennis Rodman, and George Clooney as two high-profile  ambassadors  of the US, inserted into trouble areas in order to achieve various PR, strategic or intelligence ends.This latest admission regarding actress Angelina Jolie is even more telling   where it is claimed she was being used as an expensive honey pot to lure the illusive (and possibly non-existent) Joseph Kony of the Lord s Resistance Army in the jungles of Uganda.Andrew Korybko Oriental ReviewIt s long been suspected that the actress willingly promotes CIA psy-op narratives in her films, but this time new leaks allege that Angelina Jolie had also at one time considered being the Pentagon s  bait  to  catch Kony , which draws into question the true motivation of other celebrities  foreign policy forays such as Dennis Rodman s  friendship  with Kim Jong-Un. Agent AngelinaAngelina Jolie is the poster woman for the  Hollywood-Intelligence Complex , the perfect example of a willing CIA asset who regularly goes along with  deep state  narratives in her films, such as the anti-Serb production  In The Land Of Blood And Honey . She s also been one of the loudest global cheerleaders for  humanitarian interventions  abroad, or in other words, imperialist wars waged under distorted or outright fabricated  humanitarian  reasons such as the one that she had been lobbying for in Darfur. Jolie often visits US troops abroad like in Afghanistan, though up until now there were no grounds for suggesting that she was anything other than a propagandist, as it would have been ordinarily absurd to even countenance her playing an active role in the battlefield.That s no longer the case anymore, though, according to a report by The Sunday Times, a UK-based media outlet, which claims to have read leaked International Criminal Court (ICC) documents alleging that the starlet told the organization s former chief prosecutor that she d be willing to volunteer herself as a bait to catch the phantasmal African warlord Joseph Kony. The Sunday Times article is mostly hidden behind a paywall, however, so the average information consumer needs to rely on second-hand sources such as People magazine in order to learn about what s in those leaks free of charge. According to the celebrity news site: A hoard of 40,000 ICC documents leaked to the French investigative website Mediapart reveals that Jolie once offered to act as human bait in a trap to arrest brutal Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony.She  has the idea to invite Kony to dinner and then arrest him,  reads an e-mail sent by former ICC Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, reports The Sunday Times. Forget other celebrities, she is the one,  Moreno Ocampo adds in another email.  She loves to arrest Kony. She is ready. Probably Brad [Pitt] will go also. According to The Sunday Times, which has seen the Mediapart documents, Moreno Ocampo hoped that Jolie and her now estranged husband would travel to the Central African Republic with a team of US Special Forces.It was thought that their presence would then draw Kony out of his armored compound and enable the US forces to take him into custody. If these allegations are true, then it would mean that Jolie had graduated from the usual propagandist class of Hollywood operatives to an in-field asset of the Pentagon in conspiring to carry out a globally important mission. Truth be told,  catching Kony , as the viral 2012 slogan went, isn t really that significant of a deal because the warlord is thought to have barely any supporters nowadays after years on the run in the transnational jungled space between his native Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic. In fact, the whole purpose of the CIA psy-op to  catch Kony  was to  justify  US special forces  presence in this strategic region long enough for them to manufacture civil wars in South Sudan and the Central African Republic, which would turn them into a  failed state belt  that forever prevents their crucial incorporation into a Chinese-built bicoastal Silk Road through their resource-rich territories.The geopolitics of the Kony diversion aren t the focus of this article, so it s recommended that readers review some of the author s hyperlinked analyses above if they re interested in learning more about this Hybrid War campaign. Instead, it s important to focus on the relationship between celebrities and the  deep state , both in the propaganda and   as can now be seen   in-field operational manifestations. Thus far, it doesn t seem like any of Jolie s peers attempted to follow in her footsteps by partaking in such a high-profile covert mission, but toning down the drama just a notch and removing the lethal risk involved in her extreme example, it s certainly possible that other  famous people  are doing something similar in serving their governments.ODD COUPLE: Joseph Kony & Angelina JolieThe Rodman-Kim CaseThe most relevant case that comes to mind is Dennis Rodman, who s the US   Kim whisperer  in passing along messages through what he calls  basketball diplomacy  but who actually functions as the best American pair of eyes and ears that has ever gotten to known the reclusive North Korean leader in person. It s been speculated for a few years already that Rodman might indeed be working for the CIA, but this was always dismissed by more mainstream voices who retort that he s either  too stupid  or that  the CIA wouldn t hire someone like that , but these critics never take the time to consider that Rodman might be coerced into doing this in order to avoid a hushed-up drug bust or something of that nature.In any case, his last visit to the communist country was a failure because he wasn t allowed to meet with Kim Jong-Un, although he did claim credit for jailed provocateur Otto Warmbier s release shortly before his death. Given that the American student was going to die anyway from what was likely complications from his unsuccessful suicide attempt in trying to overdose on sleeping medicine, he probably would have been released whether Rodman came to the country or not, but it s very telling that Kim Jong-Un refused to meet with his  best friend  during this time. Incidentally, it was shortly after this that the war of words and  insult diplomacy  between the North Korean and American leaders really took off, which might have been inspired by Trump finding out from his intelligence chiefs that they had lost their precious Rodman-Kim connection because Pyongyang could have figured out what the basketballer was really up to.Although it s only speculation at this point, it would indeed explain why Trump made a show out of appearing to go crazy and resorting to the  madman theory  in dealing with Kim Jong-Un, as the US Intelligence Community might have concluded that this is the only realistic way left for directly communicating with his North Korean counterpart. With Rodman s last reconnaissance mission cut short and ultimately unsuccessful, the US might have feared that Kim was signaling to them that he was prepared to imminently flex his muscles in vengeful showmanship for having been deceived this long, and while it s impossible to know exactly what he was in fact thinking, North Korea did end up staging several highly provocative missile launches this summer after Rodman s visit and even carried out a nuclear test.The above narrative might sound dubious upon first read, but it certainly deserves to be reconsidered in light of the revelation that Angelina Jolie was working with the Pentagon as part of a highly secret special operation to  catch Kony , which would in that case not make it sound so crazy to imagine that Dennis Rodman might have been doing similar field work for the CIA in collecting valuable personal intelligence about Kim Jong-Un.Even if the North Koreans are actually aware of what Rodman is up to nowadays, that doesn t mean that he ll never be allowed back into what some have derisively called the  Hermit Kingdom , as there s a certain value that could be derived from continuing to use him for informal diplomatic purposes and indirect communication with the US  deep state Continue this story at Oriental ReviewREAD MORE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hollywood FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV", "output": "0.

Now, a Yale Professor is taking on that very issue, saying that our fear of making Hitler comparisons is making us historically illiterate.Yale history professor, and author of  On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century,  Timothy Snyder isn t going so far to say that Trump is like Hitler, but he is saying that there are a lot of lessons to be learned from Hitler, specifically in how democratic republics fail and that our refusal to even talk about Hitler simply feeds our intellectual laziness.So the way to start the discussion about comparisons is to point out that Americans are extremely lazy about history. I mean that s one way in which were definitely number one among major nations. And one of the ways we re lazy about history is that as soon as anyone suggests that the past might be useful, then we say  but wait it s not exactly the same and therefore I m just going to discard it.  In that way in two or three seconds we give ourselves an excuse not to think about history.Source: Business InsiderHere s the video:var playerParam = {'pcode':'BhdmY6l9g002rBhQ6aEBZiheacDu','playerBrandingId':'6e12e8b3387a44daacfb73afba25a76e','skin': {'config': '//player.ooyala.com/static/v4/stable/latest/skin-plugin/skin.json'} };OO.ready(function() {window.pp = OO.Player.create('container', 'B1MWNzYTE6PYNvENSzDs8rjZyVjOKMu8', playerParam);        });The main reason for studying history, other than the fact that it s fascinating as hell, is to learn from what our forebears got wrong as well as from what they got right. Clearly, a hell of a lot went wrong during the late part of the 19th Century and the first half of the 20th Century. There were the robber barons, there was the Great Depression and there was the rise of fascism that killed millions of people. Perhaps if we weren t so lazy about history, we wouldn t need to talk about income inequality and banks wouldn t be too big to fail. If Mike Godwin hadn t been so wildly misinterpreted, perhaps we would not have have been silenced when comparing Trump s white nationalist following to that of Hitler. Instead, neo-nazis are now an actual voting bloc and the nation s press secretary can conveniently ignore the fact that Hitler gassed six million Jews. Hey, at least Spicer is getting us to talk about history.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", "output": "0. Fake"}

Trump tried to make the case that he fired Comey for being mean to Hillary Clinton, but even the most rabid Trump supporters have to acknowledge that his  Lock Her Up,  slogan is completely incompatible with Trump s given rationale.It doesn t take a tin foil conspiracy theorist to imagine that the real reason for the Comey firing is that he was getting too close to the truth in investigating Trump s Russia connections. NPR imagines even more scenarios, like the fact that Comey was becoming too big and was stepping on poor little Donnie s ego. It s becoming more and more likely though, that there were just two reasons Comey was fired and both of them should scare the hell out of you.According to two sources that CNN is calling  close to Comey,  the two reasons Comey was fired were:#2 confirms everything we ve been assuming since the news broke Tuesday night. #1, though, while not at all surprising, is almost more frightening.

He s clearly such a good catch (note sarcasm).Trump s going to tell us time and time again how wonderful he is, how great is for the nation, and what fantastic things he s going to do. Here s the thing   he s all talk. And now Buzzfeed has reminded us that he s not that great of a father either   or at least in the sense that a  great father  is one that actually wants to spend time with their kids.While he touts how well he can provide for his family, he apparently thinks that money can by love, and who knows, maybe it does. Yet, he most certainly made if very apparent during a 2006 interview on the Opie and Anthony show that he wants nothing to do with actually taking care of his children, besides monetary support.When asked if he changes diapers, he said: No, I don t do that There s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife and you know there s a lot of husbands that listen to that. So you know, they go for it. They  go for it ? Like their being conned into actually caring for their child. God forbid a father actually want to take part in raising a child.He added: If I had different type of wife. I probably wouldn t have a baby, ya know, cause that s not my thing. I m really like a great father but certain things you do and certain things you don t. It s just not for me. No, that s not being a  great father,  that s being a sperm donor that provides monetary assistance.To reiterate, he doesn t seem to think men should be acting  like the wife. He also said: I mean, I won t do anything to take care of them. I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. It s not like I m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park. And apparently during a 2005 Howard Stern interview Trump brought up how he hated the fact his ex-wife Marla Maples had the audacity to suggest he bring their daughter on a walk. Well, Marla used to say,  I can t believe you re not walking Tiffany down the street,  you know in a carriage. Right, I m gonna be walking down Fifth Avenue with a baby in a carriage. It just didn t work. This really just goes down deeper to the fact that Donald Trump doesn t respect women   at all. He seems to thoroughly believe in gender roles, and I bet the fact that he may be running against Hillary Clinton in the general election sends shivers down his spine. How dare a woman think they can do a man s work after all, right? I mean, he s made it clear a man shouldn t do  women s work. Trump can tout how  great  he is with women until he s blue in the face, but it s all a lie, just like with most everything else he says. He s a businessman trying to sell himself on being president, but he s clearly not remotely qualified. The fact that he s doing as well as he is speaks to the fact that he does know how to sell. However, come the general election with a far smarter electorate, that s reaches beyond the Republican base of voters, they will make sure he never sets foot in the Oval Office.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images", "output": "0.

It hasn t helped that the lower oil prices have devastated Brazil s economy:The impeachment of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff is about more than cooking the books to hide election-year spending or looting the state-owned oil company for her campaigns and cronies. What s really on trial are Rousseff s socialist policies.Those policies drove up deficits to win votes, bet too heavily on exports to China and not only failed to retool the world s ninth-largest economy to compete in the world but drove it into a recession.Rousseff was first elected in 2010 on the coattails of her mentor Luiz In cio  Lula  da Silva   a leftist labor leader who exceeded expectations as president from 2003-2011. Da Silva benefited from the windfall of revenue from exports of oil, natural gas, minerals and agriculture goods   which convinced him that his bloated anti-poverty programs were sustainable.Unfortunately, both da Silva and Rousseff ignored the dire need to improve education, reform tangled tax codes, fix stifling labor laws, invest in infrastructure or make it easier to create or operate a business.

Recipient Name Recipient Email => \nThe Iraqi armed forces are becoming bogged down in the battle for Mosul. Its elite special forces and an armoured division are fighting to hold districts in the eastern outskirts of the city against counter-attacks by Isis fighters using networks of tunnels to move about unseen. \n“In one day we lost 37 dead and 70 wounded,” said a former senior Iraqi official, adding that the Iraqi forces had been caught by surprise by the extent of the tunnel system built by Isis, said to be 45 miles long. \nThe Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) and the Ninth Armoured Division have been trying for two weeks to fight their way into that part of Mosul city, east of the Tigris River. \nIsis is sending waves of suicide bombers either as individuals who blow themselves up or in vehicles packed with explosives, snipers and mortar teams, to restart the fighting in a dozen districts that the Iraqi Army had said were already captured. \n“At first I was optimistic that we might capture Mosul in two or three weeks, but I now believe it will take months,” said Khasro Goran, a senior Kurdish leader familiar with conditions in Mosul, in an exclusive interview with The Independent . \nHe said he had changed his mind about the likely length of the siege when he witnessed the ferocity of the fighting in the outer defences of Mosul. He added that “if they [Isis] continue fighting like this then a lot of Mosul will be destroyed. I hope it will not be like Aleppo.” \nA prolonged siege of Mosul with heavy civilian casualties and the possibility of Turkish military intervention is likely to be the first international crisis to be faced by the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The slow and heavily-contested advance of the Iraqi armed forces into the city means that the attack will still be going on when he is inaugurated in Washington on 20 January. \nMr Trump would have to decide if he is willing to sanction an escalation in US-led airstrikes to destroy Isis defences, though this would inevitably lead to heavy loss of life among the estimated 1.5 million civilians in Mosul. \nA threatened military intervention by Turkey will also become more likely if the best Iraqi combat units suffer heavy losses and look for reinforcements from the Shia paramilitary Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) forces and the Kurdish Peshmerga. \nUnder an American-brokered agreement, these are being kept out of the city of Mosul itself to avoid sectarian and ethnic tensions between them and its Sunni Arab population. \nTurkey has sent tanks to the Turkish-Iraqi border and said it may invade if the Hashd or Peshmerga fight inside Mosul. \nThe problem for the Iraqi armed forces is that they have previously relied heavily on US-led airstrikes to destroy Isis fighters in fixed positions. There have been 10,300 such airstrikes in Iraq since 2014. \nIn the battle for Ramadi in 2015 some 70 per cent of the city was destroyed, but almost all of the 350,000 population had fled and Isis did not fight to the last man. The same was true of the outer ring of towns around Mosul like Bartella and Qaraqosh a dozen more miles from the city, which were empty of their largely Christian inhabitants, making it easier to target and destroy from the air buildings held by Isis. \nThe same tactics cannot be used in Mosul because its people are still there and the city is very big. The Baghdad government offensive that began on 17 October went well until it reached Mosul’s outskirts two weeks ago. \nSince then the fighting has swung backwards and forwards with districts being captured or recaptured three or four times. \nIn al-Qadisiyah al-Thaniya district, which the CTS had entered on Friday, the elite soldiers later retreated and Isis fighters returned. A local resident told a news agency that “they came back to us again, and this is what we feared. At night there were fierce clashes and we heard powerful explosions.” \nIn Intisar, another embattled east Mosul district, the Iraqi army’s Ninth Armoured Division has found that its tanks are vulnerable in street fighting for which its soldiers have neither experience nor training. Last Tuesday it lost two T-72 tanks. \nThere were some signs of Isis disarray at the start of the siege. Hoshyar Zebari, the former Iraqi Finance and Foreign Minister, says that by far “the biggest surprise for Isis was some months back when the Iraqi government and the leaders of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) agreed on a joint offensive against Isis in Mosul.” Isis did not expect this – Baghdad and the KRG had previously been barely on speaking terms because of economic and territorial disputes. \nWhen Iraqi forces first attacked east Mosul, there were reports of wavering morale among some Isis fighters, but the Isis leadership has mercilessly enforced its control. \nThe UN says that it has executed some 70 civilians in Mosul accused of collaboration with Iraqi forces over the last week. Last Tuesday alone 40 people were dressed in orange jumpsuits and shot for “treason and collaboration” before being hanged from electricity poles. \nAnother 20 civilians have been shot for using mobile phones to leak information to the Iraqi army and their bodies were hanged at traffic lights. \nThe real level of support for Isis in Mosul is unclear. The 54,000 people who have fled the city and sought refuge behind Peshmerga or Iraqi army lands all express their hatred of movement and deplore its atrocities. \nBut local Christians and Kurds view the displaced civilians from Isis with suspicion as possible covert Isis supporters. “I see that Isis are getting their families to safety,” said one Christian driving past a camp of white tents occupied by Internally Displaced People (IDPs) at Khazar, east of Mosul. \nMr Goran is an expert on the internal politics of Mosul where he was deputy governor between 2003 and 2009, and leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in the city until 2011. Speaking of the political sympathies of its people, he said that “a third of the population supports Isis, much of the rest is passive and only a small percentage actively resisted them.” \nHe believes that reports of extensive anti-Isis armed resistance inside the city was largely propaganda designed for the media. He pointed out that there might be a lot of foreign fighters in Mosul, but “the majority of fighters are Iraqis”. \nDuring the almost two-and-a-half years in which Isis has ruled Mosul since it captured it in June 2014 it has concentrated on recruiting young adolescents and teenagers to its cause. These are given extensive ideological and technical training to turn them into fanatical fighters or suicide bombers. \nIsis is holding out effectively in east Mosul and may be able to withstand a siege for many months, but it is likely to lose the battle for the city in the long term. Iraqi army units are approaching Mosul from the south and the Hashd are closing off the escape routes to the west. A last stand by Isis in the city, however, could lead to its destruction.

All the while, the woman most harmed by FBI Director Comey’s partisan attack has been suffering in silent agony, victimized first by her abuser and then by the men with badges. \nFBI agents claimed that they spoke with her to seek justice, only for Comey to turn around and betray her, to victimize her yet again, by thrusting her story into the white heat of the last week in a bitterly contested general election campaign’s final media feeding frenzy with one vaguely worded memo guaranteed to draw maximum questioning by the press. \nThe anonymous teen who only went to the FBI under the promise of anonymity and was grilled by agents for seven hours just last Friday. Only minutes after ending that interrogation, she was contacted by journalists who knew her identity only minutes after ending the discussions with the federal law enforcement officers. \nClearly, her identity was somehow no longer a secret. The media contacted the teen victim and her family before even the FBI case manager let her know about Comey’s memo, and it all happened before she could escape the public eye to safeguard her privacy. So she wrote this letter and delivered it to a national entertainment website : \nI am the 15-year-old (now 16) who was the victim of Anthony Weiner. I now add you to the list of people who have victimized me. I told my story originally to protect other young girls that might be a victim of online predators. \nYour letter to Congress has now brought this whole matter back into the media spotlight. Not even 10 minutes after being forensically interviewed with the FBI for seven hours, I received a phone call from a REPORTER asking for a statement. Why didn’t you communicate with the local FBI agents that I had just spoken to? They could have scheduled our interview sooner or scheduled a time to interview me later, or change locations of the interview. My neighborhood has been canvassed by reporters asking for details about me. \nIn your letter, you chose to use a vague approach, meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how. Every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my “story.” Why couldn’t your letter have waited until after the election, so I would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle? \nIn his “cooperation” with you and with his love of the spotlight, Anthony Weiner has given information that led to the media finding me. You have assisted him in further victimizing me on every news outlet. I can only assume that you saw an opportunity for political propaganda. \nI thought your job as FBI Director was to protect me. I thought if I cooperated with your investigation, my identity as a minor would be kept secret. That is no longer the case. My family and I are barraged by reporters’ phone calls and emails. I have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing Donald Trump to now be leading in some polls and costing Hillary the election. \nAnthony Weiner is the abuser. Your letter helped that abuse to continue. How can I rebuild my life when you have made finding out my “story” the goal of every reporter? When I meet with my therapist next time, she will already know what we are going to talk about before I get there by reading Friday, October 28th, 2016’s New York Times article. \nI may have been Weiner’s victim, but the real story here is that I am a survivor. I am strong, intelligent, and certain that I will come out from under this nightmare, but it will not be as a result of your doing your job to protect me. I hope that by making my letter to you public, you will think about how your actions affect the victims of the crimes you are investigating. The election is important, yes, but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me, is much more important. It’s time that the FBI Director puts his victims’ rights above political views. \n— Girl that lost her faith in America \nP.S. To all reporters: AP, FOX, CBS, NBC, and all other media outlets, please respect my position and stop interrupting my life! \nIt’s impossible to read this letter without tears for the teenage girl who was victimized by Anthony Wiener, and bravely stepped forward to alert the authorities so they could stop a sad sex predator so mentally ill, that after his out of control actions cost him his career and his public image, he continued his behavior until he lost his marriage and perhaps next his freedom for the safety of others. \nInstead, the very authorities at the FBI who pledged to maintain her anonymity and seek justice for her, and to prevent she, and others from facing the same ills, have turned into a political party with badges – and not a very well coordinated group of people with badges either. \nOur nation needs leaders who place their duty above partisan politics, and in law enforcement we need cops on the beat to protect the victims, not to abuse the victims for their own partisan games. \nOur nation needs for FBI Director James Comey to admit his mistakes and vacate his position, before the next victim of crime gets victimized by his unsavory political maneuvering using the country’s top law enforcement agency to slander someone else into political compliance.", "output": "0.

These templates insist that professors will wholeheartedly agree to  keep the white students from dominating all classroom discussions,  and  reflect a commitment to queer visibility,  while advising students against the temptation to  thoughtlessly reproduce the standard white and Western model of legitimate knowledge. More than 20 colleges enforce a requirement that faculty demonstrate their commitment to the ideals of  diversity, equity, and inclusion,  the OAS found. However, they say this is only the tip of the political correctness iceberg as many post-secondary institutions do not directly enforce the diversity requirement but administer it through coercion and that many institutions demand adherence to diversity statements for entrance to Ph.D. programs or when applying for a university job.The University of Oregon used a diversity statement scheme like this when it ordered that a faculty member s teaching must  reflect the diversity of the field, including the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of its scholars and practitioners.  The university also demands that professors exercise good faith in  incorporating issues of equity, implicit bias, and cultural understanding in new faculty searches.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: October 27, 2016 -  By Eduard Popov for Fort Russ - translated by J. Arnoldski - \n\n\nLast week, an event occurred capable of revolutionizing not only Ukraine, but all of Eastern and part of Central Europe. On October 20th, the Ukrainian parliament adopted the Declaration of Memory and Solidarity of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland and Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. This document condemned the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and modern Russian policy and remarked that “the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact concluded by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany led to the Second World War.” \nLet’s set aside pseudo-scholarly interpretations of what is officially called the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact but is more famously known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. This agreement was preceded by Western countries’ (England and France’s) unprecedented concessions to German Chancellor Adolf Hitler. These included the betrayal of Czechoslovakia by the Munich Agreement (which British Prime Minister Chamberlain praised as “peace for our time”) followed by the invasion of the country in late September 1938 by the troops of Hitler’s Germany, Poland, and Hungary. Stalin’s USSR (of which I am no supporter) consistently sought to create a common European system of defense against Hitler’s Germany in contrast to the USSR of Lenin and Trotsky which in the early 1920’s sought to bring revolutionary war to Europe. But England, the chief architect of interwar Europe, deliberately pushed Hitler to the East for the Third Reich and Soviet Union to collide.  \nAs early as 1934, the foreign policy leaders of the Second Polish Republic had concluded a nonaggression pact with Germany 5 years before the analogous agreement concluded by the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, but refused to sign a nonaggression pact with the USSR. Poland paid for its anti-Soviet (in fact anti-Russian) policies and complicity in the occupation of Czechoslovakia with the loss of its independence and enormous human losses. England paid for such with a one-on-one war with Hitler’s Germany that lasted a whole year, during which only the insular island position of the English saved them from German occupation. Soviet Russia paid for this with the bloodiest war in its history, from which it emerged as the victor and liberator of all of Europe. The leaders of today’s Europe are not inclined to gratitude towards Russia for its historic mission and the millions of Russians who laid down their lives on the altar of European freedom. \nUkraine, a state which can count only a quarter century of existence, has no historical tradition, historical memory, nor strategic thinking. Thus, its current establishment is incapable of even thinking about the immediate consequences of its resolution on the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. And these consequences will be very bitter for Ukraine. \nToday’s Poland is already talking about restitution, i.e., the return of Poles’ property in the Kresy, i.e., the eastern lands which belonged to Poland before the Second World War and amount to 5 regions of modern Ukraine (Galicia and Volyn) and Western Belarus and Lithuania. By condemning the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Ukraine is automatically condemning its sovereignty over 5 western regions therin recognized as illegally seized from Poland.  \nNot so long ago, Verkhovna Rada Speaker Parubiy called for a visa regime to be introduced with Russia, thereby depriving 5 million Ukrainian “guest workers” of bread and solid earnings. The consequences of the Rada’s resolution on October 20th go even further by questioning the territorial borders of contemporary Ukraine, of which President Putin once said half belong to Russia and half to Eastern Europe. \nThe condemnation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact done to curry favor with the Poles is not Ukraine shooting itself in the foot, but shooting itself in the head to spite its Russian neighbor.  \nPoles will undoubtedly take advantage of Ukrainians’ fantastic foolishness and will one day demand that their lands be returned, in particular Lvov, their “Cemetery of Eaglets” that is so sacred to Poles’ historical memory. They will also demand their territorial share of Czech Republic, the lands of Transcarpathian Rus that they lost in 1945 and are now Ukraine’s, Romanian Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina which were annexed in 1940 and transferred to Soviet Ukraine, and Hungary’s part of Transcarpathia, now also part of Ukraine. All of these lands were acquired by Ukraine thanks to Stalin’s Commissar of Foreign Affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov, who has now been condemned by the Verkhovna Rada as the initiator of the Second World War.  \nUkraine’s state actors, being so devoid of any historical and state experience and tradition, do not bother to look so “far” (beyond their own noses) into the future. The issue of territorial claims being raised against Ukraine by its current allies in the West is only a matter of time. As long as the West needs Ukraine as a springboard for war against Russia, Ukraine’s sovereignty over its western territories criminally acquired thanks to Stalin and Molotov will not be challenged. But as soon as the situation changes, the West will suddenly “remember” the territory of Soviet Ukraine, which today’s successor state of Ukraine has called “the totalitarian USSR”, and demand that its historical debts be paid off. \n\nThis will concern not only Ukrainians, but also Belarusians, Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Romanians, and Russians. The Ukrainians have launched a domino effect whose consequences will be felt across all of Europe.  \n\n     Follow us on Facebook!                                                   \n                                                   \n\n       Follow us on Twitter! \n                               \n\n             Donate!", "output": "0.

The judge said his decision had nothing to do with politics. “The local NAACP chapter questioned that assertion and wondered whether the Judge would have jailed Burton if she was wearing a ‘Support the Troops’ pin.” Atty. Andrea Burton ultimately agreed to wear her pin in the courthouse, but not in the courtroom. Social Justice Attorney Andrea Burton: Jailed for Refusing to Remove Black Lives Matter Lapel Pin by Bill Quigley \n“To remain neutral becomes an accomplice to oppression.” \nAndrea Burton, a 30 year old Ohio criminal defense lawyer, was rocketed onto the national social justice scene this summer after she was handcuffed and jailed for refusing to take off a Black Lives Matter pin while in court. \nBurton’s stance received international attention . “I think that you can’t remain silent or you remain a party to oppression,” she told The Washington Post . “I am usually a pretty agreeable person. I’m always smiling. I’m polite. I have manners. But at some point it eats away at you how any time people see you talk about Black Lives Matter, then you’re being sensitive, you’re the person who’s racist.” In interviews with local media Burton insisted “I'm not anti-police, I work with law enforcement and I hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record, I do believe all lives matter. But at this point they don't all matter equally.\" \nThe Black Lives Matter pin was about one inch across , the size of a nickel . Burton refused an order to remove the Black Lives matter pin by Youngstown Ohio Judge Robert Milich . Burton told the Judge she was asserting her First Amendment rights . “I said I’m respecting my first amendment right, that I’m not neutral to injustice, and to remain neutral becomes an accomplice to oppression.” The judge held her in contempt of court, jailed her and sentenced her to five days. After being jailed for five hours and the NAACP was called in to help, the judge released Burton pending an appeal of his decision. \nJudge Milich, who was already famous for announcing his refusal to perform any marriages on the day the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same sex marriage, told the media that his own personal opinions had nothing to do with the decision. The local NAACP chapter questioned that assertion and wondered whether the Judge would have jailed Burton if she was wearing a “Support the Troops” pin. When asked by The Daily Beast , whether he would jail a lawyer for wearing a pin that said Support Our Troops, he refused to say. “I can’t speculate on what a political pin might be until I look at it. I just used the definition in the Black’s Law Library Dictionary, and the standard dictionary of what’s political.” The Judge further muddied the waters when he said “There’s a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pin that’s on a political issue.” \n“Burton told the Judge she was asserting her First Amendment rights.” \nBurton paid a high price for her convictions. After she was jailed, Burton, who had been previously regularly appointed to represent numerous Youngstown Municipal criminal defendants , said she was “frozen out” of the appointment process for representing criminal defendants and received no appointments at all. \nBurton then filed a federal civil rights damages actio n against Judge Milich, the other Youngstown Municipal Judge, and the City of Youngstown for violations of her constitutional rights to Freedom of Speech, Due Process and Equal Protection. In the civil rights case, filed in the Northern District of Ohio, Burton pointed out police officers were in the same courtroom with black tape over their badges and the judge did nothing to them. After court monitored settlement discussions, Burton agreed to drop her federal civil rights case. In return the Judge agreed to drop her contempt charge. Burton said she will continue to wear her BLM pin in the courthouse but not inside the courtroom. Further, the settlement provided that local judges agreed not to retaliate against her and will fully consider her requests for future appointments to court-appointed cases. \nWho is this brave lawyer? \nBeginnings \nBurton grew up in Youngstown, Ohio in a family active in the civil rights movement. “My grandfather marched on Washington with Martin Luther King ,” said Burton. “He was a good friend of A. Phillip Randolph . He protested in the South during the Civil Rights Movements and attended the 1963 March on Washington. He was one of the first black Councilpersons for Youngstown. My mother was pretty active in the black awakening during the 60s. She was fairly militant about civil rights as a teen and was what we know now as a feminist.” \nSome of her courage is no doubt due to her upbringing. Burton’s older brother was born with a rare genetic disorder that left him mentally disabled and very sickly as a child. Dad operated a successful business despite addiction issues until his death when Burton was 15. Mom, a legal secretary and later a court bailiff, did heroic work caring for the family. \n“My mother’s compassion and dedication greatly influenced how empathetic I have become. She pushed me greatly to do more than what was expected, to excel when it would be simpler to be typical. She never told me that there was anything I could not do if I set my sights on achieving it. She worked hard to make the resources available to me if I actually wanted them. Both my parents were college educated. Both were heavily invested in learning. \n“My parents never really treated me as a child so I was often exposed to difficult realties and frank conversations. I was conscious of the ways people were different (i.e., gender, orientation, race, or class) but how it did not matter at all in determining their worth.” \nStudies \nBurton always did well in school. “I was expected to be a good student. My father was relentless about math grades and performances especially. I won a sport in the Junior Statesman Program at Georgetown University to study government when I was 16 years old. It was a highly competitive program that included people from all over the world. \nBurton earned a scholarship and graduated from Youngstown State University in 2008 in pre-law and journalism. She was awarded another scholarship to study for her Masters in Library and Information Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . \n“I decided to become a lawyer as I finished my bachelor’s degree.” So after she received her graduate degree she returned to Ohio and commuted from home to attend the University of Akron School of Law . “The best part of law school was working in the legal clinic.” There she wrote appellate briefs for prisoners, provided legal research to inmates, handled applications for clemency to the governor and other pro bono services to low income individuals. She took social justice classes when she could and wrote a major paper on Kelley Williams-Bolar who was convicted of a felony for enrolling her children in another better school district. “I wanted to study why anyone would commit a felony to educate their kids, why was it necessary? What differences where there?” \n“She wrote appellate briefs for prisoners, provided legal research to inmates, handled applications for clemency.” \nAfter becoming a lawyer, Burton began a small private practice and spent a lot of her time working as a public defender. “It was a shock,” Burton admits. “People with power and influence held some bigoted ideas. People were not treated fairly and it was quite disheartening. \n“As a criminal defense lawyer, I am motivated by humanity, compassion and the oath I took to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I am often asked how I could represent those accused of crimes, some heinous crimes. I see criminal defense work as an opportunity to make sure that the promise that the criminal justice system makes “innocent until proven guilty” is followed. Getting convictions and imparting justice are two very different things. My job is to make sure that statutes and rules are followed to guarantee a fair and impartial trial. Politics should not factor into that. I am merely an instrument of justice but I take my role extremely seriously. \n“It is sometimes challenging to work with other attorneys and people in the justice system who are oblivious to the discrepancies people of color and impoverished people experience within the system that is set up to eradicate those inequities. I am also disappointed in people who accept the status quo just because it is easy and convenient. We need to be willing to continually re-evaluate our role in furthering injustice. \nJustice \n“Justice sometimes comes slowly, through time, by the changing of minds through understanding and experience. Other times it is the result of tumultuous uncertain revolutions. The problem with maintaining justice is that often we only recognize what justice is by seeing injustice. Sometimes the world needs a major event, a major catalyst to stir change. That process is often frightening. To me, living in a world where we value some more than others is unjust. Especially when some are undervalued to the point that people are systematically dying. When people are too afraid to have an informed dialogue about how factors intersect to create injustice that perpetuates injustice. Willful blindness in the face of a wealth of information is the greatest threat to civilization today. \nSustainability \n“One of the ways I sustain myself is that I read continuously. I read philosophy as well as political and spiritual texts. I have a close friend that I speak with virtually every week. He has been a savior for me since I was 17 years old. We understand each other because we are both avid readers, with similar interests in philosophy and in that we both have always felt a sense of isolation and disconnection from our peers. This is important because I think that more and more people feel a sense of disconnect from the world despite the many connections created through social media. \n“When someone asks me for a book recommendation, I suggest Strength to Love by Martin Luther King Jr. It is a religious book, but I do not read it simply for the Christian aspects of it. I read it because it’s empowering, powerful and because King was an extremely smart compassionate person and it shows. I also read Nietzsche religiously. \n“I am involved in the YWCA which is dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all. \n“My dream is that differences in color would actually be as relevant as shoe size and that religious fanaticism would disappear.” \nAdvice to Law Students \n“Learn to see value in every human being and truly read the papers that are the foundation of this Country. Study and understand the Constitution and The Federalist Papers . They demonstrate how this democracy was formulated. Know your history because it shapes today in ways you will never appreciate fully otherwise. Be prepared to examine yourself for your own conflicts in logic and your own biases. Learn how lawyers can become accomplices to injustice, even if unintentionally. \nRole Models \n“ Harriet Tubman , Sojourner Truth , Alexander Hamilton , W.E.B Du Bois , Langston Hughes , James Baldwin , Gandhi , Malala Yousafzai , Martin Luther King , A. Phillip Randolph , Rosa Parks , Thurgood Marshall , Ralph Abernathy , and Joseph Lowery inspire me. Malcolm X of course. And our President Barack Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama . I am also inspired by the countless individuals who face oppression and injustice in their lives daily but continue to work toward a better world. I am inspired by those who fight for those who are limited in power or face nearly insurmountable odds. I think the work of those individuals is the key to making the world a place where love conquers hate and fear. \nConclusion \n“The day I wore that button and was found in contempt changed my life, the effect of it are still rippling, some in destructive ways and others in very inspiring ways. I wore it because my soul was so tired from all the inequities I had seen over my 4 years of practice. I was exhausted from losing a series of small battles for understanding for my vulnerable clients. I was tired of the indifference of the prosecutorial offices. And all I could think to do was wear this button for a little joy. For a small win. To hope to change someone’s mind. Bill Quigley teaches law at Loyola University New Orleans.", "output": "0. Fake"}

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Let’s Be Clear – A Vote For Warmonger Hillary Clinton Is A Vote For World War 3   \nBy Michael Snyder \nIf you want to see war without end, vote for Hillary Clinton. It is tremendously ironic that Hillary Clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray Donald Trump as “dangerous” and “temperamental”, because it is Clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable. She has a temper that is absolutely legendary, and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades . Hillary Clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in Syria, thanks to her Libya is a post-apocalyptic wasteland today, and now she is picking a fight with the Russians before she has even won the election. Of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle, there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as Hillary Clinton, and if she wins the election I am fully convinced that World War 3 will begin before her time in the White House is over. \nSomeone that shares this opinion with me is Donald Trump. According to Reuters , Trump recently stated that we are “going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton”… \nOn Syria’s civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict. \nClinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” on the ground to protect non-combatants. Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets. \n“What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,” said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. “You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.” \nIn order to have a no-fly zone in Syria, you would have to enforce it. \nAnd in order to enforce it, you would have to be willing to shoot at the Russians. \nAccording to National Intelligence Director James Clapper , that could have dire consequences… \nRussia could shoot down a U.S. aircraft if a no-fly zone were imposed over Syria, National Intelligence Director James Clapper said Tuesday. \n“I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,” Clapper said, speaking with CBS’ Charlie Rose at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York about several national security issues. \nOf course Clapper is not alone in that assessment. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Francis Dunford, says that imposing a no-fly zone over all of Syria “would require us to go to war” … \n“Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,… That’s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly I’m not going to make.” ( Senate Armed Services Committee, September 22, 2016, emphasis added) \nBut Hillary Clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants. \nYou see, the truth is that Hillary Clinton wants to win the war that she started in Syria. Back in 2011, she spearheaded an effort along with Saudi Arabia and Turkey to try to use the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East as an opportunity to try to overthrow President Assad in Syria. If it wasn’t for her meddling, millions of refugees would not be pouring into Europe and elsewhere, and there would be no “humanitarian crisis” in Syria at all. \nThanks to Russian intervention, the war in Syria is not too far from being over, but the Obama administration is desperate to keep it going. They understand that if Assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted, and that is why they are so determined to keep Aleppo from falling. Without Aleppo, many of the jihadist rebels that the Obama administration has been supporting won’t have anywhere to hide. \nSo the Obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the Syrian military, and the Russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen . If Obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against Syrian forces and the Russians start shooting back, that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control. \nOne recent survey found that current American leadership has a 1 percent approval rating in Russia right now, and the Russians dislike Hillary Clinton even more than they dislike Barack Obama. The Russians know that if Hillary Clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us, and that is why they desperately want Donald Trump to win in November. You can see this outlook reflected in comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin recently made about the two candidates … \n“Mrs. Clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country, against Russia. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, calls for cooperation – at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism,” Putin said. \n“Naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us. And we consider it wrong, that we always have to be in conflict with one another, creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world,” Putin noted. \nAnyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that Hillary Clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for Russia. The thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate, but it may soon become a reality. \nAnd even now, the Obama administration and our NATO allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with Moscow. This week it is being reported that NATO troops will soon be sent to Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania … Nine hundred US troops are to be sent to eastern Europe next year as America’s troubled relationship with Russia enters new, uncertain territory. A US-led battle group of NATO allied soldiers will be sent to Poland as part of the multi-nation operation. British forces will lead one of the four battle groups in Estonia, Canada will spearhead the presence in Latvia and Germany will be present in Lithuania. \nIn addition, Infowars is reporting that U.S. Marines will soon be stationed in Norway near the border with Russia… \nAfter accepting a Pentagon proposal, Norway will host US Marines at a base near the Russian border as Russia deploys nuclear-capable ships to Kaliningrad. \nA rotating force of approximately 330 Marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of Vaernes, just outside Trondheim, beginning in January. Norway and Russia share an 122-mile border in the Arctic. \n“The US initiative to augment their training and exercises in Norway by locating a Marine Corps Rotational Force in Norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship,” said Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Søreide. \nMost Americans aren’t aware of any of this, nor do they really care about our relationship with Russia. \nBut in Russia things are completely different. The possibility of war with the United States is the biggest news story over there these days , and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation … \nRussian authorities have stepped up nuclear-war survival measures amid a showdown with Washington, dusting off Soviet-era civil-defense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities. \nAt the Kremlin’s Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Cold War is back. \nThe country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the U.S.S.R., with what officials said were 40 million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats. \nI know that I have been writing about this over and over , but the truth is that we are on a path to war with Russia, and the election of Hillary Clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war. \nIn my controversial new book , I expressed my belief that war with Russia is coming, but at the time that I wrote it I didn’t know how the election would turn out. \nAt this point it looks like Clinton is very likely to win on November 8th, and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with Russia. \nIf you are reading this and you are considering voting for Hillary Clinton, please don’t do it . We simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the White House at this critical time. \nIf the American people do choose Hillary Clinton this November, I believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly, bitterly regret in future years.", "output": "0.

Currently, polls have Hillary Clinton ahead by ten to seventeen points. Clinton, who is ahead nationally by more than 200 pledged delegates and hundreds more superdelegates, will need to win her home state to continue momentum after Sanders  string of wins in the previous weeks.A New York win for Clinton will mean more delegates she desperately needs, and with that will come superdelegate support.But the superdelegates have continued to cause controversy within the Democratic primary. Supporters who back Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have decried the system, feeling the individuals who make up the superdelegate system have been manifestly unfair as to how they allocate their support.Supporters within the Sanders camp have demanded that the superdelegates vote the same way as the pledged   at the will of the voters for that state.But that isn t how the superdelegate system is set up (another word for superdelegates is unpledged delegates).However, that hasn t stopped the demands. And it hasn t stopped the harsh criticism, either. While these delegates have been regarded as  shills,   bought-and-paid-for  and  establishment, one superdelegate wants to remind the nay-sayers of one thing: they are still human.Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Congress  first openly-lesbian senator, is also a superdelegate. And she s pretty fed up with the inquisitions. On MSNBC s Morning Joe, the progressive senator claimed if Sanders clinches the popular vote by the time the convention is held in July, she will cast her vote for him. However, as Clinton continues her popular vote lead, she s supporting the former Secretary of State. She added, nervously: I am a human being and a Superdelegate. To put it plainly, based on how the rules are set up, Baldwin is free to vote her conscience, and her conscience says Hillary Clinton for now. Those who back Senator Sanders point to the fact he beat Clinton by 13 points in Wisconsin, thus Baldwin is somehow obligated to back him.It is important to remember that these superdelegates are party leaders who, in their own right, have been elected within the Democratic Party   whether it be a position within the DNC, or a senatorial, gubernatorial or representative position. It s also important to remember these delegates have nothing but the best of intentions for their party and the future of the country.Baldwin hasn t reported any harassment, but other superdelegates have (one s 12 year old child received the brunt of hrrasment when they answered the phone).Here s Baldwin s appearance on MSNBC:  Featured image via Astrid Riecken/Getty Images", "output": "0.

Even in the U.S. presidential debates, the arguing between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton has been almost exclusively about ISIS, not Al Qaeda. \nThough Al Qaeda got the ball rolling on America's revenge wars in the Middle East 15 years ago by killing several thousand Americans and others in the 9/11 attacks, the terrorist group has faded into the background of U.S. attention, most likely because it messes up the preferred \"good guy/bad guy\" narrative regarding the Syrian war. \nFor instance, the conflict in Aleppo between Syrian government forces and rebels operating primarily under Al Qaeda's command is treated in the Western media as simply a case of the barbaric Assad and his evil Russian ally Vladimir Putin mercilessly bombing what is portrayed as the east Aleppo equivalent of Disney World, a place where innocent children and their families peacefully congregate until they are targeted for death by the Assad-Putin war-crime family. \nThe photos sent out to the world by skillful rebel propagandists are almost always of wounded children being cared for by the \" White Helmet\" rebel civil defense corps , which has come under growing criticism for serving as a public-relations arm of Al Qaeda and other insurgents. (There also are allegations that some of the most notable images have been staged , like a fake war scene from the 1997 dark comedy, \"Wag the Dog.\") - Advertisement - \nRare Glimpse of Truth \nYet, occasionally, the reality of Al Qaeda's importance in the rebellion breaks through, even in the mainstream U.S. media, although usually downplayed and deep inside the news pages, such as the A9 article in Saturday's New York Times by Hwaida Saad and Anne Barnard describing a rebel offensive in Aleppo. It acknowledges: \n\"The new offensive was a strong sign that rebel groups vetted by the United States were continuing their tactical alliances with groups linked to Al Qaeda, rather than distancing themselves as Russia has demanded and the Americans have urged. ... The rebels argue that they cannot afford to shun any potential allies while they are under fire, including well-armed and motivated jihadists, without more robust aid from their international backers.\" (You might note how the article subtly blames the rebel dependence on Al Qaeda on the lack of \"robust aid\" from the Obama administration and other outside countries -- even though such arms shipments violate international law.) \nWhat the article also makes clear in a hazy kind of way is that Al Qaeda's affiliate, the recently renamed Nusra Front, and its jihadist allies, such as Ahrar al-Sham, are waging the brunt of the fighting while the CIA-vetted \"moderates\" are serving in mostly support roles. The Times reported: \n\"The insurgents have a diverse range of objectives and backers, but they issued statements of unity on Friday. Those taking part in the offensive include the Levant Conquest Front, a militant group formerly known as the Nusra Front that grew out of Al Qaeda; another hard-line Islamist faction, Ahrar al-Sham; and other rebel factions fighting Mr. Assad that have been vetted by the United States and its allies.\" - Advertisement - \nThe article cites Charles Lister, a senior fellow and Syria specialist at the Middle East Institute in Washington, and other analysts noting that \"the vast majority of the American-vetted rebel factions in Aleppo were fighting inside the city itself and conducting significant bombardments against Syrian government troops in support of the Qaeda-affiliated fighters carrying out the brunt of front-line fighting.\" \nLister noted that 11 of the 20 or so rebel groups conducting the Aleppo \"offensive have been vetted by the C.I.A. and have received arms from the agency, including anti-tank missiles. ... \n\"In addition to arms provided by the United States, much of the rebels' weaponry comes from regional states, like Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,\" Mr. Lister said, \"including truck-borne multiple-rocket launcher systems and Czech-made Grad rockets with extended ranges.\" \nThe U.S./Al Qaeda Alliance", "output": "0.

Trump dismissed the low unemployment rate as well, claiming that he  heard  that it was much higher, as high as 42 percent, which is an outrageous lie.Chris Wallace played footage of this while interviewing Trump s chief economic adviser and former Goldman Sachs executive. You know, the same Goldman Sachs that Donald Trump repeatedly vilified during the campaign because of Hillary Clinton s ties to them.Anyway, Wallace pointed out that while Trump is touting the recent February jobs report that shows the economy added 235,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dropped from 4.8 to 4.7 percent, he is clearly being a hypocrite because he called previous jobs reports  phony. If that s true, why should we believe these numbers?  Wallace demanded to know before noting that Trump inherited a strengthening economy from the Obama administration.  And the fact is, did you inherit an economy that has been for the last 18 months somewhere between 4.6 and 5 percent unemployment? Of course, rather than admit that Trump is full of shit, Cohn ignored the question and made it sound like Trump is an economic hero. The economy continues to grow and we are doing out part, Cohn said before claiming that CEOs are telling Trump that they are adding jobs because of him. We are creating these jobs because of you, Mr. President, and your policies.  Which have not, yet, come into any sort of effect.Here s the video via YouTube:The bottom line is that the economy is continuing to grow because of President Obama s economic policies. Many of the investment plans that companies are announcing right now were in motion well before the election in November. But Trump has been desperately trying to take credit for the economy.So let s all remember how Trump is currently taking credit for all the good economic news. Because once the economy implodes under his watch, he ll definitely try to blame the black guy for it.Featured Image: Screenshot", "output": "0. Fake"}

It turns out that after the stock market plunge and the feeding frenzy by the leftist media, ABC News got it wrong. Flynn was actually in contact with the Russian Ambassador during the Trump transition period, which is an entirely different story. In fact, according to a video that was uncovered by citizen journalist Jack Posobiec, Obama s State Department told reporters during the Trump transition period, that the State Department didn t have any problem with the transition team meeting with any foreign officials (See video below). According to CNN correspondent Jim Acosta, the Obama regime actually gave the  go-ahead  for Flynn to have conversations with the Russian Ambassador: On Friday, the White House said that it was the Obama administration that authorized former national security adviser Michael Flynn s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during President Trump s transition, according to CNN. Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Kislyak in the month before Trump took office, the first current or former Trump White House official brought down by special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian election meddling. Court records indicate that his communications with Kislyak were directed by a Trump transition official, with multiple news outlets reporting that official was Trump s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.  They are saying here at the White House that Flynn s conversations with Sergey Kisylak were quote,  authorized  by the Obama administration,  CNN correspondent Jim Acosta said.General Michael Flynn released the statement below: After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of  treason  and other outrageous acts.

One of the kids asked me if I saw (people) protesting and rioting in St. Louis. I said yes; I said,  Do you know why they are doing it?  said Coach Orlando Gooden.Coach Gooden said his player responded,  Because black people are getting killed and nobody s going to jail. Gooden, who played football at Mizzou, said the kids knew about the Jason Stockley decision. I felt like it was a good teaching moment for me to circle the team and have a meeting,  he said.Watch:Here are just a few shocking statistics the coach could have shared with his players about neighboring E. St. Louis, IL:WND- Before Ferguson exploded in reaction to the August shooting of black teen Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson, the St. Louis police chief raised eyebrows when he called for the use of drones to monitor high-crime areas.The proposal was a response to what St. Louis police authorities called  subhuman, antisocial, urban terrorist  behavior by criminals.St. Louis also is homeof the notorious  Knockout Game,  a random but racially motivated assault that has claimed at least six lives.St. Louis is 44 percent white and 49 percent black, but statistics shows a racial imbalance in crime. Based on the city s official crime data for 2012   the most recent year which data are available   97.6 percent of those arrested for murder were black and 2.4 percent were white. More than 82 percent of those arrested for serious crimes like murder, aggravated assault and larceny were black, while just 17.5 percent arrested were white.Black males in St. Louis were responsible for the vast majority (63.5 percent) of crimes committed. Other groups contribute significantly less to the serious crimes in St. Louis. White males made up 17 percent of arrests, black females were 14 percent of arrests and white females only 5.3 percent of arrests.There are other strange imbalances in arrests: Black females were arrested for 14 murders compared with three white males arrested for murder. Black females were arrested for more robberies, aggravated assaults and larcenies than white males.These are just a few of the lowlights in a city on the verge of becoming, as U.S. News said, the most dangerous city in America.Consider one violent night in St. Louis last June when 18 people were shot in seven different shootings. Bloody Night Leaves Many in St. Louis Outraged  read one headline.However, some of the shooting victims were not outraged enough to cooperate with law enforcement. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay described the  no snitchin  mentality of many crime victims: These are disputes, and there are victims who won t talk to the police,  the mayor said.  Trying to make an arrest isn t that simple. In one case, they ve got (multiple) people shot and not one of them would identify the shooter. Slay remarked,  In the vast majority of these cases, people are using their guns to settle their own petty feuds, and that s really what s very unfortunate and outrageous about this. Local news reported on a shooting in a housing complex involving an AK-47 in which  a black male armed with the AK-47 came around the corner [and] started shooting  at an 18-year-old woman and four of her friends.Juanita Sparks, 60, of St. Louis told reporters,  I am tired of thugs. Colin Gordon, author of  Mapping Decline: St. Louis and the Fate of the American City,  calls St. Louis  the poster child of white flight.  However, middle- and upper-middle class blacks are also leaving the city in significant numbers.The Cahokia football coach, who had the perfect opportunity to educate these young minds about getting a good education and staying away from a dead-end life of crime, instead, took the opportunity to disrespect the law enforcement officers tasked with protecting these crime-ridden neighborhoods.  The coach said he spoke to them about that and other situations that have happened in our country. He then explained why former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the anthem.

We must keep our hatred against them (the U.S.) alive and fan it to paroxysms!  -Che Guevara, head of Cuba s  Foreign Liberation Department,  Nov. 17, 1962We have a president who won t tie Islamic terrorists to Islam, has cut a one-sided deal with Iran, as they continue to chant  death to America,  and has made an open alliance with a communist country who has a long history of hating America. The same country Obama is fighting to normalize relations with, would have committed an unspeakable act of terrorism against us, had our FBI not thwarted their plans.  Why the rush to embrace so many nations and leaders who have a long history of wanting to harm us Barry?  On the morning of November 17th, 1962, FBI headquarters in Washington D.C. took on  all the trappings of a military command post,  according to historian William Breuer. The previous night an intelligence puzzle had finally come together. The resulting picture staggered the FBI men. And these had served at their posts during WWII and the height of the Cold War. They d seen plenty. Now they had mere days to foil a crime against their nation to rival Hideki Tojo s.The agents and officers were haggard and red-eyed  but seriously wired. Like hawks on a perch they d been watching the plot unfold, sweating bullets the whole time. It was nearing time to swoop down on Fidel Castro and Che Guevara s agents, busy with a terror plot that would have made ISIS drool decades later.Alan Belmont was second to J Edgar Hoover at the time. Raymond Wannall headed the Bureau s Intelligence Division. That nerve-jangling morning both were in Belmont s office just down the hall from Hoover s. Both were burning up the telephone lines to their agents in New York. On one phone they had Special Agent John Malone who ran the New York field office. On other lines they talked with several carloads of FBI agents slinking around Manhattan. These were keeping a touch-and-go, but more or less constant, surveillance on the ringleaders of the Cuban terror plot.Castro s agents had targeted Macy s, Gimbels, Bloomingdales, and Manhattan s Grand Central Station with a dozen incendiary devices and 500 kilos of TNT. The holocaust was set for detonation the following week, on the day after Thanksgiving.A little perspective: For their March 2004 Madrid subway blasts, all 10 of them, that killed and maimed almost 2,000 people, al-Qaeda used a grand total of 100 kilos of TNT. Castro and Che s agents planned to set off five times that explosive power in the three biggest department stores on earth, all packed to suffocation and pulsing with holiday cheer on the year s biggest shopping day. Macy s get s 50,000 shoppers that one day. Thousands of New Yorkers, including women and children actually, given the date and targets, probably mostly women and children were to be incinerated and entombed. ( We greeted each other as old friends,  gushed Jimmy Carter when visiting Fidel Castro in 2002.)At the time, the FBI relied heavily on  HUMINT  (Human Intelligence.) So they d expertly penetrated the plot. One by one the ringleaders were ambushed. The first was named Roberto Santiesteban and he was nabbed while walking down Riverside Drive. As the agents closed in, Santiesteban saw them and  took off! And as he ran, Santiesteban was jamming paper in his mouth and chewing furiously.But six FBI agents were after him, all fleet of foot themselves. Finally they closed the ring and  triangulated  the suspect. Santiesteban fell, raging and cursing, flailing his arms and jabbing his elbows like a maniac. They grabbed his arm and bent it behind his back just as he was reaching for his pistol.While this group got their man, another FBI squad arrested a couple named Elsa Montero and Jose Gomez-Abad as they left their apartment on West 71st Street. The FBI speculated that as many as 30 others might have been in on the plot, but these were the head honchos. Had those detonators gone off, 9/11 might be remembered as the SECOND deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil.Some of these plotters belonged to the New York Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, an outfit that became MUCH better known a year later on that very week. Incidentally, at the time of the Manhattan terror plot, the Fair Play For Cuba Committee also included among its members, CBS correspondent Robert Taber (an early version of Dan Rather, who conducted Castro s first network television soft-soaping on Aug. 30, 1957), along with The Nation magazine co-owner Alan Sagner. In 1996 President Clinton appointed Alan Sagner head of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.Terror-plotters Roberto Santiesteban, Elsa Montero and Jose Gomez-Abad belonged to the Castro-Cuban Mission to the U.N. and escaped prosecution by indignantly claiming  diplomatic immunity.

It s a brilliant tactic for a company who will probably never resort to its name because it understands how to build from American greed at its very core.

Bankruptcy is there to help people in severe financial situations put their debt behind them and move on. It s also a way for sheisters to get a bunch of free stuff, make a bunch of money and work the system. Donald Trump qualifies as the second type; working the system   and openly admitting it   4 times now. Trump s idea to  fix America  has taken a turn toward this mentality and the very thought of it is frightening,The New York Times reported that in an interview Thursday, Donald Trump talked about how he would approach the national debt. Thinking like a failed businessman, he insisted we should simply go to our creditors and ask them to take less. Yes, in one idiotic statement, Donald Trump exposed just how little he knows about the economy or how the debt works. As The Times points out, there is no credible evidence suggesting that our debtors would reduce we owe them by a nickel. Trump thinks he s dealing in people with real estate they can t move selling bad debt for more bad debt until one day so much of the debt is paper   bad paper   that there s nothing left to do but fail. Sound familiar? It should; it s what Wall Street and the Dubya administration did to us in 2008.Let s assume for a moment that our creditors would take less. The bulk of the national debt is money we owe to ourselves. Is Trump going to ask the Social Security trust fund to take pennies on the dollar because we had a couple of wars that were too expensive and some handouts to fix the mess? How much less should those people who won t be able to retire when the fund is wiped out take? They ve been putting 6.2 percent of their paycheck into that fund since they started working. How much less should they settle for?As for our other creditors, We re not defaulting on rented furniture. We owe other countries a great deal of money, plus interest, that they provided to us in cash. We use that money to fund the government. If creditors start seeing those kinds of tactics we ll have our credit rating lowered and lose credibility as a country. There s also a good chance the dollar would be removed as the world standard currency. Ask Donald Trump what he ll do when we can t just print more money.The bottom line is, Trump has no idea what he s talking about. The national debt is one of the most misunderstood components of the federal government. For someone to seek the office that holds much influence over how that debt shrinks or grows without understanding it is preposterous, but then again   we are talking about Donald Trump.Featured image from billingsgazette.com", "output": "0.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: October 30, 2016 4056 The intense anti-Russian campaign in the West is a sign of weakness rather than strength. The Russian air defence system in Syria has closed down the US's military options. Hillary Clinton knows it and her policies in Syria if she is elected President will be simply a continuation of Obama's. Share on Facebook October 2016 will one day be recognised as one of those months – like October 1962 and October 1973 – when the world passed through a period of great danger. The cause of the danger was the collapse in September of the Kerry-Lavrov agreement and the resulting stand-off this October between the US and Russia in Syria. This culminated in high level discussions within the US government about possible attacks on Syrian army bases , followed by public threats from Russia to shoot down US aircraft if such attacks took place. As The Duran reported – but as the Western media has conspicuously failed to do – following these threats from Russia, the US backed down . These events have been barely reported in the West. Instead what we have witnessed is a deafening cacophony of abuse of Russia for its actions in Syria, with the country baselessly accused of war crimes , and with things written and said about its political leadership which go far beyond what was written and said even during the height of the Ukrainian crisis in 2014. At one level this abuse is an attempt to embarrass the Russians to call off the Syrian army’s offensive on the Jihadi held districts of eastern Aleppo. However it undoubtedly also reflects the huge anger and sense of humiliation in Washington and in certain other Western capitals caused by the US climbdown earlier in the month. The intensity of the media campaign against Russia is however creating something of a climate of fear, with most people unaware that the most dangerous moment of the crisis has in fact already passed. Much of this fear is centred on the personality of Hillary Clinton, now widely expected to be the next US President. Based on her record and her statements, she is widely supposed to be a hardline foreign policy hawk who has never seen a war she didn’t like or want to join, and who is widely expected to escalate dramatically the confrontation with Russia in Syria and elsewhere. Many also point to Hillary Clinton’s known previous support for a no fly zone in Syria, and her comments on the campaign trail, which many see as suggesting that she plans one still. Is all this however true? Is the greatest moment of confrontation between the US and Russia in Syria still to come? Will things really get far more dangerous if Hillary Clinton becomes President? Are we really looking at World War III? In my opinion these fears are wrong. The great confrontation has already taken place, and it took place this October. A direct clash between the US and the Russian militaries in Syria was avoided, and there is now no possibility that it will happen. What this means is that there is now no possibility of Hillary Clinton imposing a no fly zone on Syria or of her ordering an armed confrontation with the Russians there. Nor is there any chance of Barack Obama doing so in the few months left to him. Nor is there any chance of either Obama or Hillary supporting Boris Johnson’s hare-brained idea for a no bombing zone in Syria, or of either of Obama or Hillary Clinton ordering US attacks on Syrian military bases. The reason none of these things will happen is because the US’s uniformed military opposes all of them. In the face of the US military’s opposition none of them can happen. The reason the US military opposes these schemes is because they would all require the US military to take on the very extensive and very sophisticated air defence system the Russians have set up in Syria. The US military has made it absolutely clear that it is completely opposed to doing this. In the days immediately following the US climbdown brave reports appeared in parts of the media which claimed the US military is confident of its ability to take on and defeat the Russian air defence system. It did not however take long for a report to appear in The Washington Post – obviously sourced from the US military – which made it clear that this is not the case. The Washington Post article, in addition to giving a comprehensive picture of the scale of the Russian air defence system in Syria, contains a frank admission that the US military is far from confident of its ability to defeat it “While there is some disagreement among military experts as to the capability of the Russian systems, particularly the newly deployed S-300, “the reality is, we’re very concerned anytime those are emplaced,” a U.S. Defense official said. Neither its touted ability to counter U.S. stealth technology, or to target low-flying aircraft, has ever been tested by the United States. “It’s not like we’ve had any shoot at an F-35,” the official said of the next-generation U.S. fighter jet. “We’re not sure if any of our aircraft can defeat the S-300.”” Since this article appeared in The Washington Post information has trickled out showing just how formidable the Russian defence system in Syria actually is. Whatever the precise purpose of the Russian military’s complaint about the alleged Belgian air raid on Hasajek , it does at least show that the Russians can now track US and NATO aircraft as they take off from their bases in Jordan, and almost certainly from Incirlik air base in Turkey as well. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz has also admitted that the Russian air defence system is restricting the operations of the Israeli force, with the US based internet journal Al-Monitor reporting – based obviously on information provided by Israeli sources – that “The S-300 and S-400 missile systems that Russia put in place cover all of Israel up to the southern Negev. Russian radar will immediately lock on Israeli jets taking off from any base, except for the Uvda air force base near the southern city of Eilat, and their flight patterns will be under constant surveillance . That is how the Russians keep an eye on the Israeli air force’s activities over “hotspots” along the borders between Syria and Lebanon. Should he want to, Putin can simply push a button and turn the lives of Israeli pilots and the commanders who sent them on offensive strikes in Syria into a living hell.” (bold italics added) Meanwhile we know US intelligence is advising the US government that the Russians not only have the capability to shoot down US aircraft, but are not bluffing when they say they will do so. No less a person than Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, speaking to the Council of Foreign Relations on Tuesday 25th October 2016, has said as much “I wouldn’t put it past them ( NB: the Russians – AM ) to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground. The system they have there is very advanced, very capable and I don’t think they’d do it – deploy it – if they didn’t have some intention to use it.” The Washington Post article confirms that the US military was always reluctant to impose a no fly zone over Syria because of Syria’s sophisticated air defences. In the face of the vastly more sophisticated air defence system the Russians have created in Syria the option of declaring a no fly zone over Syria or of undertaking any of the other US military options that have been talked about in Syria for all practical purposes no longer exists. In saying this I realise some people continue to imagine terrifying scenarios of the US swamping the Russian air defence system in Syria by launching hundreds of aircraft and missiles against it whilst daring Russia to escalate. In the real world of political and military decision making, it beggars belief the US military would be prepared to do this in view of the heavy casualties and the possibility of uncontrolled escalation it would risk. There is simply no chance of the US military willingly engaging in a military confrontation with the Russians in Syria and risking World War III in order to rescue a gang of Al-Qaeda led Jihadi terrorists in Aleppo and to fulfil some people’s fantasies of regime change there. None of this is going to change if Hillary Clinton is elected President in November. Whilst Hillary Clinton could in theory try to order the US military to take military action and risk confrontation with the Russians in Syria against its wishes, in practical political terms doing this is all but impossible since it would leave her catastrophically exposed in the very likely event that something went badly wrong. In addition Hillary Clinton would almost certainly face a massive groundswell of opposition from Congress and the nation, which would surely dwarf the one that caused Obama to back off his proposed missile strikes against Syria in 2013, if she tried to do such a completely reckless thing. Hillary Clinton, whatever her faults, is far too experienced a politician to take on these well-nigh unbelievable risks. It is not as if Hillary Clinton does not know the huge risks of ordering military action in Syria. Here is what she said about them back in 2013, when she discussed the prospects of imposing a no fly zone in Syria during a private speech to Goldman Sachs “They ( NB: the Syrians – AM ) are getting more sophisticated thanks to Russian imports. To have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we’re not putting our pilots at risk—you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians. So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians. In Libya we didn’t have that problem. It’s a huge place. The air defenses were not that sophisticated and there wasn’t very—in fact, there were very few civilian casualties. That wouldn’t be the case. And then you add on to it a lot of the air defenses are not only in civilian population centers but near some of their chemical stockpiles. You do not want a missile hitting a chemical stockpile.” Note that Hillary Clinton said all these things back in 2013, long before the Russians deployed their own vastly more sophisticated air defence system in Syria. If she had doubts about the wisdom of military action in Syria in 2013, then she will have far greater doubts about it now If a President as belligerent and confrontational as George W. Bush was unable to order the US military to attack Iran against its wishes – as he undoubtedly wanted – then there is no possibility Hillary Clinton – who despite her reputation is neither stupid nor a fanatic – can order the US military against its wishes to attack the Russian military in Syria now. What then of Hillary Clinton’s supposed campaign statements about wanting a no fly zone in Syria? When these are read carefully it becomes clear that Hillary Clinton plans no such thing. Here is what she had to say on the subject during her third debate with Donald Trump “First of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I’m well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general. This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation, and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe Zones on the ground .” (bold italics added) In other words what Hillary Clinton is really supporting is not a no fly zone across the whole of Syria, but a “safe zone” within Syria the terms of which would be negotiated with the Syrians and the Russians. That is of course exactly what the Turks – with US support – are already busy setting up in north east Syria through their Operation Euphrates Shield. In fact the more carefully Hillary Clinton’s comments are analysed the clearer it becomes that her policies if elected would be essentially the same as those of the current Obama administration. In her private 2013 comments to Goldman Sachs she made it clear that her preferred way of working in Syria was not through direct confrontation with the Syrians but covertly – in other words by arming and aiding the famously elusive “moderate rebels” in Syria in exactly the way the US under Obama has been doing “And there is still an argument that goes on inside the administration and inside our friends at NATO and the Europeans. How do intervene—my view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene . We used to be much better at this than we are now.” (bold italics added) However in her final third debate with Donald Trump she let slip that she is no more keen for Jihadis to get hold of sophisticated weapons (including by implication anti aircraft weapons) than Obama is, even if she tried to hide the fact by making a bizarre point about terrorists being prevented from buying guns across the counter in the US “That’s why I want to have an intelligence surge that protect us here at home while we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online. Why we have to make sure here at home we don’t let terrorists buy weapons. If you’re too dangerous to fly, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun.” This is consistent with what Hillary Clinton said in 2013 to the Jewish United Fund Advance & Major Gifts Dinner, where she admitted that the large scale presence of militant Jihadi groups sponsored by Saudi Arabia and Qatar in Syria has made distinguishing between “moderate rebels” and Jihadi militants – and preventing weapons supplied to “moderate rebels” from falling into the hands of Jihadi militants – all but impossible “Some of us thought, perhaps, we could, with a more robust, covert action trying to vet, identify, train and arm cadres of rebels that would at least have the firepower to be able to protect themselves against both Assad and the Al-Qaeda-related jihadist groups that have, unfortunately, been attracted to Syria. That’s been complicated by the fact that the Saudis and others are shipping large amounts of weapons—and pretty indiscriminately—not at all targeted toward the people that we think would be the more moderate, least likely, to cause problems in the future, but this is another one of those very tough analytical problems.” Overall it is impossible to see any real difference between the policies Hillary Clinton advocates and those Barack Obama is already following in Syria. Like Barack Obama Hillary Clinton does not intend to impose a no fly zone. Like Barack Obama Hillary Clinton is wary of supplying sophisticated weapons to the “moderate rebels” in case they might fall into the hands of Jihadi militants. Hillary Clinton does want to set up a “safe zone” in Syria, which she believes (almost certainly wrongly) will give her “leverage” over the Russians in future negotiations about Syria’s future. However she realises this has to be negotiated with the Russians, and besides it is what Erdogan and Obama are already busy trying to set up in north east Syria through Operation Euphrates Shield, so far with only very partial success. Even Hillary Clinton’s immediately declared objectives are the same as Obama’s . Like Obama her priority is not regime change in Damascus or the capture of Aleppo; it is the capture first of Mosul and then of Raqqah “The goal here is to take back Mosul. It’s going to be a hard fight. I’ve got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqah, which is the ISIS headquarters.” It is no coincidence that shortly after these comments the Obama administration openly discussed plans to capture Raqqah . The similarity of positions on Syria between Obama and Hillary Clinton in fact reveals an important truth about a future Hillary Clinton administration: it would not be a new administration at all, but rather it would be an extension of the present one. This is not surprising. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama worked closely together when Hillary Clinton was Obama’s Secretary of State. Obama obviously wants her to win the election and is pulling out all the stops to help her . it is a certainty she is being consulted about administration policy and has a role in making it, and that issues like the capture of Mosul and Raqqah are discussed with her. Just as Obama is less of a dove than he sometimes likes to pretend, so Hillary Clinton is less of a hawk than she sometimes wants people to think. It is often overlooked that Obama and Hillary Clinton are both lawyers. Both are skilled at using language to give a sometimes misleading impression of what they are about. There is no doubt about the huge anger and of the sense of humiliation in Washington at the climbdown Russia forced on the US this October. There is also no doubt that there are lots of people in the US foreign policy establishment who yearn for a President who will “put Putin in his place” and who will take a more confrontational line with Russia on Syria and elsewhere. These people unfortunately have achieved a lock-grip on the US and Western media, and this enables them to a great degree to shape the public discussion with the result that they have a disproportionate influence on policy. Unfortunately Hillary Clinton has chosen to fight her election campaign by pandering to these people. The result is that she gives the impression of intending a more confrontational policy in Syria than a careful analysis of her words shows she really does. Thus she has fostered the impression that she is looking to impose a no fly zone on Syria when a careful analysis of her words shows she intends no such thing. This is going to create many problems for Hillary Clinton if she does win the election. However that does not change the fact, which Hillary Clinton certainly knows, that following the events of this October a direct military confrontation between the US and the Russians in Syria because of the opposition of the US military quite simply cannot happen. The US is not going to declare a no fly zone over Syria, or ride to the rescue of the Jihadis in Aleppo, or take any other military steps there beyond those it has already taken, whether Hillary Clinton is elected US President in November or not. What we are unfortunately likely to see is a case of more of the same, even though that is a same which has already repeatedly failed. Thus we can expect more attempts to identify and train “moderate” Jihadis and to supply them with more weapons – this time inside the Turkish controlled “safe zone” that is being created for them – and perhaps more efforts to redirect the more radical Jihadis from Iraq to Syria to cause more trouble for the Russians and for the Syrian government. In my opinion these policies – which are simply continuations of the policies the US has been following in Syria ever since the war started there more than four years ago – are unsustainable, and are bound eventually to fail. With the populous areas of western Syria and the main cities all likely to fall soon under the secure control of the internationally recognised Syrian government, these policies cannot achieve regime change in Syria. If the US persists with them the US far more than Russia risks becomes bogged down in Syria in a war it cannot win. As a matter of fact there are tell-tale signs this is already happening, with the US plan to advance on Raqqah already causing problems with the US’s Turkish ally. Putting all that aside, the sound and fury of the current anti-Russian campaign should not mislead us. It is not a reason for fear. It is a product of weakness and failure, not of confidence and strength. Its exceptionally high volume and its ferocious tone are the product of the US’s feelings of humiliation and failure in Syria following the events of this October. It is after all natural for someone who feels defeated to over-compensate by being over-assertive, and that is what we are witnessing now. Certainly the anti-Russian campaign is not a sign the US is about to go to war with Russia, whether in Syria or anywhere else. On the contrary it is a reflection of the fact war cannot happen precisely because the US in the form of the Russian air defence system in Syria is now faced with an adversary it is not confident it can defeat at any remotely acceptable cost. Irrespective of whether Hillary Clinton wins the Presidency in November, that is the reality. The moment of greatest danger in the Syrian crisis has passed.", "output": "0. Fake"}

BREAKING: Rigging the Election – Video III: Creamer Confirms @HillaryClinton Involvement https://t.co/ozb1frZ7rR #Veritas @PVeritas_Action \n— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) October 24, 2016 \nThis third installment includes a shocking number of insights into how the Democratic Party has been running the Clinton campaign. Several of the most memorable quotes from the video include: \n“Nobody is really supposed to know about me.”-Aaron Black \n“So Brad, and Bob, and Lux, and myself are all part of the old school method where, it doesn’t matter what the freakin’ legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherf**ker.” -Aaron Black \n(In regards to the “Donald Duck” characters showing up at Trump events): “Skalar [Clinton operative] had gone to some buddy of his who is one of her body people and she explained the idea to Hillary. And Hillary just loved it. Let me tell you something, I think she has the right instinct here. This thing is working, is resonating but that story is not exactly what you want to hear about how presidential decision-making happens.” -Robert Creamer \nThe coordination between the Clinton Camp, the DNC, and Americans United for Change is a rather obvious violation of federal campaign finance laws regarding expenditures. DNC chair Donna Brazile was also involved in the coordination with the Clinton Camp as well. \nAdditionally, Robert Creamer discussed why the Donald Duck idea had to be owned by AUFC and not by the DNC. \n“The duck has to be an Americans United For Change entity. This had to do only with some problem between Donna Brazile and ABC, which is owned by Disney, because they were worried about a trademark issue. That’s why. It’s really silly.” \nLater in the video Creamer revealed why that is the case: \n“Donna Barzile had a connection with them and she didn’t want to get sued.” \nAnd finally, an explicit admission about Hillary’s desires, straight from Creamer himself: \n“We originally launched this duck because Hillary Clinton wants the duck.” \nWatch the full video below: \nThis certainly seems to be illegal campaigning, based on these videos. One of the interns even stated that there was a whole slew of reasons why responsibilities had to be divvied up, because the whole scheme was a mess. And why is that? Because they are violating campaign coordination law, so they have to. \nIt’s truly unbelievable. A plethora of revelations now show us how corrupt Hillary Clinton and the DNC are, yet there are still millions of people that support them. If these revelations continue, and they still support her, what can you really say? \nWhen corruption penetrates this deeply, and when the citizens still wholeheartedly back those who are driving the corruption, the country is in serious danger. \nGod help us.", "output": "0.

Shortly after his blockbuster movie appeared in theaters across America, Dinesh D Souza was charged with violating federal campaign finance laws and was sentenced to five years of probation, a $30,000 fine, and eight months in a San Diego  community confinement center  where he was forced to undergo  therapeutic counseling. Here is what Dinesh D Souza predicted:Driven by the alleged anti-colonialist ideology of a father he barely met, President Barack Obama systematically is undermining America economically and militarily   leaving it vulnerable to financial collapse, and even as unlikely as the possibility may seem, nuclear attack.And it charges as he slashes the defense budget, Obama is simultaneously pushing to reduce the nation s nuclear stockpile to as low as a few hundred missiles   even as other countries like China, Russia and North Korea are modernizing and expanding their arsenals, and Iran   widely believed to be close to developing nuclear weapons   is threatening to annihilate Israel.   From Dinesh D Sousa s controversial 2010 book,  The Roots Of Obama s Rage   WNDHere is what is actually happening today:The United States cut its nuclear stockpiles by 20 percent between 1996 and 2013, with more reductions likely to come, according to recently declassified information released by the White House.Stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, or HEU, which is used to fuel a nuclear weapon, were cut from 740.7 metric tons to 586.6 metric tons from 1996 to 2013, according to recently declassified information made available by the Obama administration. This reflects a reduction of over 20 percent,  the White House announced.  Moreover, further reductions in the inventory are ongoing; the U.S. Department of Energy s material disposition program has down-blended 7.1 metric tons of HEU since September 30, 2013, and continues to make progress in this area. The stockpile reductions are part of an effort by the Obama administration to eliminate nuclear materials and move away from these types of weapons.The move comes as countries such as Russia and North Korea move to increase their nuclear stockpiles. Russia, for instance, has made several announcements about its intent to boost its nuclear stockpile and number of weapons.However, the United States is moving in the opposite direction.Via:WFB", "output": "0.

Whitehead Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard by Congress, the President, or the people . Outwardly we have a Constitutional government. We have operating within our government and political system a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state . The important point to remember about this group is not its ideology but its organization It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government . This group is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically irremovable.\n Senator William Jenner, 1954 speech\n Unaffected by elections. Unaltered by populist movements. Beyond the reach of the law.\nSay hello to Americas shadow government.\nA corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are, in essence, running the country, this shadow government represents the hidden face of a government that has no respect for the freedom of its citizenry.\nNo matter which candidate wins the presidential election, this shadow government is here to stay. Indeed, as recent documents by the FBI reveal, this shadow government also referred to as The 7th Floor Group may well have played a part in who will win the White House this year.\nTo be precise, however, the future president will actually inherit not one but two shadow governments.\nThe first shadow government, referred to as COG or Continuity of Government, is made up of unelected individuals who have been appointed to run the government in the event of a catastrophe. COG is a phantom menace waiting for the right circumstancesa terrorist attack, a natural disaster, an economic meltdownto bring it out of the shadows, where it operates even now. When and if COG takes over, the police state will transition to martial law.\nYet it is the second shadow government also referred to as the Deep Statethat poses the greater threat to freedom right now. Comprised of unelected government bureaucrats, corporations, contractors, paper-pushers, and button-pushers who are actually calling the shots behind the scenes, this government within a government is the real reason we the people have no real control over our government.\nThe Deep State, which operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power, makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative government.\nSo who or what is the Deep State?\nIts the militarized police, which have joined forces with state and federal law enforcement agencies in order to establish themselves as a standing army. Its the fusion centers and spy agencies that have created a surveillance state and turned all of us into suspects. Its the courthouses and prisons that have allowed corporate profits to take precedence over due process and justice. Its the military empire with its private contractors and defense industry that is bankrupting the nation. Its the private sector with its 854,000 contract personnel with top-secret clearances, a number greater than that of top-secret-cleared civilian employees of the government. Its what former congressional staffer Mike Lofgren refers to as  a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies : the Department of Defense, the State Department, Homeland Security, the CIA, the Justice Department, the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a handful of vital federal trial courts, and members of the defense and intelligence committees.\nIts every facet of a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the citizenry powerless in the face of the governments power grabs, corruption and abusive tactics.\nThese are the key players that drive the shadow government.\nThis is the hidden face of the American police state that will continue long past Election Day.\nJust consider some of the key programs and policies advanced by the shadow government that will continue no matter who occupies the Oval Office.\nDomestic surveillance.\nNo matter who wins the presidential popularity contest, the National Security Agency (NSA), with its $10.8 billion black ops annual budget, will continue to spy on every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone. Thus, on any given day, whether youre walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. Local police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear, from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders. Technology now makes it possible for the police to scan passersby in order to detect the contents of their pockets, purses, briefcases, etc. Full-body scanners, which perform virtual strip-searches of Americans traveling by plane, have gone mobile, with roving police vans that peer into vehicles and buildings alikeincluding homes. Coupled with the nations growing network of real-time surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, soon there really will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.\nGlobal spying.\nThe NSAs massive surveillance network, what the Washington Post refers to as a $500 billion  espionage empire , will continue to span the globe and target every single person on the planet who uses a phone or a computer. The NSAs Echelon program intercepts and analyzes virtually every phone call, fax and email message sent anywhere in the world. In addition to carrying out domestic surveillance on peaceful political groups such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace and several religious groups, Echelon has also been a keystone in the governments attempts at political and corporate espionage .\nRoving TSA searches.\nThe American taxpayer will continue to get ripped off by government agencies in the dubious name of national security. One of the greatest culprits when it comes to swindling taxpayers has been the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), with its questionable deployment of and complete mismanagement of millions of dollars worth of airport full-body X-ray scanners, punitive patdowns by TSA agents and thefts of travelers valuables. Considered essential to national security, TSA programs will continue in airports and at transportation hubs around the country.\nUSA Patriot Act, NDAA.\nAmericas so-called war on terror, which it has relentlessly pursued since 9/11, will continue to chip away at our freedoms, unravel our Constitution and transform our nation into a battlefield, thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act. These laws completely circumvent the rule of law and the rights of American citizens. In so doing, they re-orient our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law, rather than the U.S. Constitution, is the map by which we navigate life in the United States. These laws will continue to be enforced no matter who gets elected.\nMilitarized police state.\nThanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge, police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military, complete with jackboots, helmets, shields, batons, pepper-spray, stun guns, assault rifles, body armor, miniature tanks and weaponized drones. Having been given the green light to probe, poke, pinch, taser, search, seize, strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance, all with the general blessing of the courts, Americas law enforcement officials, no longer mere servants of the people entrusted with keeping the peace, will continue to keep the masses corralled, controlled, and treated like suspects and enemies rather than citizens.\nSWAT team raids.\nWith more than 80,000 SWAT team raids carried out every year on unsuspecting Americans by local police for relatively routine police matters and federal agencies laying claim to their own law enforcement divisions, the incidence of botched raids and related casualties will continue to rise. Nationwide, SWAT teams will continue to be employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances including angry dogs, domestic disputes, improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer, and misdemeanor marijuana possession.\nDomestic drones. The domestic use of drones will continue unabated. As mandated by Congress, there will be 30,000 drones crisscrossing the skies of America by 2020, all part of an industry that could be worth as much as $30 billion per year. These machines, which will be equipped with weapons, will be able to record all activities, using video feeds, heat sensors and radar. An Inspector General report revealed that the Dept. of Justice has already spent nearly $4 million on drones domestically, largely for use by the FBI , with grants for another $1.26 million so police departments and nonprofits can acquire their own drones.\nSchool-to-prison pipeline.\nThe paradigm of abject compliance to the state will continue to be taught by example in the schools, through school lockdowns where police and drug-sniffing dogs enter the classroom, and zero tolerance policies that punish all offenses equally and result in young people being expelled for childish behavior. School districts will continue to team up with law enforcement to create a schoolhouse to jailhouse track by imposing a double dose of punishment: suspension or expulsion from school, accompanied by an arrest by the police and a trip to juvenile court.\nOvercriminalization.\nThe government bureaucracy will continue to churn out laws, statutes, codes and regulations that reinforce its powers and value systems and those of the police state and its corporate allies, rendering the rest of us petty criminals. The average American now unknowingly commits three felonies a day, thanks to this overabundance of vague laws that render otherwise innocent activity illegal. Consequently, small farmers who dare to make unpasteurized goat cheese and share it with members of their community will continue to have their farms raided.\nPrivatized Prisons.\nStates will continue to outsource prisons to private corporations, resulting in a cash cow whereby mega-corporations imprison Americans in private prisons in order to make a profit. In exchange for corporations buying and managing public prisons across the country at a supposed savings to the states, the states have to agree to maintain a 90% occupancy rate in the privately run prisons for at least 20 years.\nEndless wars.\nAmericas expanding military empire will continue to bleed the country dry at a rate of more than $15 billion a month (or $20 million an hour). The Pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety. Yet what most Americans fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense.\nAre you getting the message yet?\nThe next president, much like the current president and his predecessors, will be little more than a figurehead, a puppet to entertain and distract the populace from whats really going on.\nAs Lofgren reveals, this state within a state, concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue , is a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose.\nThe Deep State not only holds the nations capital in thrall, but it also controls Wall Street (which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater) and Silicon Valley.\nThis is fascism in its most covert form, hiding behind public agencies and private companies to carry out its dirty deeds.\nIt is a marriage between government bureaucrats and corporate fat cats.\nAs Lofgren concludes:\n[T]he Deep State is so heavily entrenched, so well protected by surveillance, firepower, money and its ability to co-opt resistance that it is almost impervious to change If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent, uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past. It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock: Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agenda.\nIn other words, as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , as long as government officialselected and unelected alikeare allowed to operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, the courts and the citizenry, the threat to our freedoms remains undiminished.\nSo the next time you find yourselves despondent over the 2016 presidential candidates, remember that its just a puppet show intended to distract you from the silent coup being carried out by Americas shadow government.\nConstitutional attorney and author John W.

She exposed his nonsensical view of the world in a searing national security speech, and now she did it over his dangerous, risky, and shameful career in the private sector.At a blistering speech in Columbus, Ohio (a very important swing state), Clinton worked in some very stinging zingers against the  billionaire  mogul, including a shot at his multiple bankruptcies:Trump has written a lot of books about business   but they all seem to end at Chapter 11.Clinton also referred to the pending lawsuit against Trump University (which the media has completely forgotten about since the shooting in Orlando), saying,  The same people he s trying to get to vote for him are people he s been exploiting for years. Trump and his campaign, of course, deflected, and accused her of running a  hedge fund  for the Clinton Foundation during her tenure as Secretary of State.Here s the difference between what Trump did (and his currently doing) and what Clinton has done:The Clinton Foundation took money from countries around the world and turned it into AIDS medication, schools and learning supplies for girls, clean drinking water in Africa, and hospital supplies in the Middle East. Trump tried to scam veterans out of a donation until the media called him out on it. And he scammed thousands of honest, hardworking Americans out of their money in a fraudulent  university. But Clinton s speech wasn t just an attack on Trump. She carefully and plainly laid out her economic agenda:Notably, even with the drawn-out battle against Bernie Sanders behind her, Clinton hewed closely to progressive goals and rhetoric. She vowed in her speech to veto any efforts to undo Dodd-Frank financial reforms and reiterated her opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, while noting that Trump s own businesses have engaged in the kinds of outsourcing he now attacks.Clinton s rhetoric is getting sharper, and her strategy is getting clearer: she s going to crush Donald Trump.Featured image via J.D.

The comment goes hand-in-hand with the theme Sanders has been hammering for months. I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires,  Sanders said during the CNN Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas on Oct. 13.  In fact, tonight, in terms of what a political revolution is about, there are 4,000 house parties   100,000 people in this country   watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country. Sanders war chest has been driven by smaller donations   he raised $26 million in small increments in the third fund-raising quarter.Jeff Weaver, Sanders  campaign manager, insists the fancy fundraisers and big-name donors are few and far between and that there is no contradiction in what the Vermont Democrat and self-described socialist practices and what he preaches. We don t have a super PAC,  Weaver told FoxNews.com.  We rely on small contributions. Average contribution is $27. Are there some, a few people in there who have more money, personal money who give larger contributions? Yeah, of course they do, but within the federal $2700 limit. No, you know, no 50, 100, 2 million contributions. But for years Sanders has enjoyed donations from a handful of wealthy donors including media moguls Leo J. Hindery and Steven C. Markoff.Markoff, who donated to Sanders  2012 Senate campaign, began trading rare coins when he was 11. By 2004, his company A-Mark Entertainment was listed as the 65th largest privately held company in the U.S., and the second largest in Los Angeles.Hindrey, managing partner of the private equity fund InterMedia Partners and former chief executive of AT & T Broadband and of the YES Network, also maxed out on contributions to Sanders. Hindrey, while advocating for fewer tax breaks for the wealthy, is among the biggest Democratic fundraisers in the country.Another big money donor to Sanders  campaign is David Geffen, co-founder of DreamWorks Animation and worth a cool $6.9 billion. According to campaign finance records, Geffen donated the max at the time   $2,500   to Sanders Senate campaign on Jan. 27, 2012.But Lara Brown, director of George Washington University s political management program, told FoxNews.com that she doesn t see a big push-back from Sanders supporters. By and large, Democrats tend to believe these individuals are giving because they have a strong progressive/liberal orientation in their politics and they are doing this because it equates to them giving to a cause,  she said, adding that the same would be true for big-money donors in Silicon Valley and the tech industry.Via: FOX News", "output": "0.

The Times compares this lie to “reports” that Trump adds an inch to his actual body height in his bio materials, and also repeated the gag line that he boasted about how long his penis is (no word on whether it is or is not actually longer than expected.)You have to wade down to paragraph 12 to learn other New York developers use the same count-the-basements levels gimmick to be able to advertise their buildings as taller. There is absolutely no news. The Russians Head over to Slate , which published an “investigative piece” alleging a Trump computer server was secretly communicating with a Russian bank. The story had previously been debunked by the New York Times and The Intercept, but Slate ran it as if they had uncovered the smoking gun proving Trump is under the control of the Russians.At Mother Jones , another article alleged that an anonymous, former intelligence officer provided the FBI with information on a Russian scheme to help Trump win the presidency.“There’s no way to tell whether the FBI has confirmed or debunked any of the allegations contained in the former spy’s memos,” the story said. “But a Russian intelligence attempt to co-opt or cultivate a presidential candidate would mark an even more serious operation than the hacking.”One more example, from Vox , which wrote without even bothering to source it at all “There is basically conclusive evidence that Russia is interfering in the US election, and that this interference has been designed to damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. There is strong evidence linking Trump’s foreign policy advisers to Russia, and Trump’s stated policy ideas are extremely favorable to Russian interests.” Journalism Much? I’ve chosen these examples because they are from publications that have in the past enjoyed decent reputations for reporting, and because these stories were run as “news,” not opinion columns, where the standards go right through the floor. Even Mother Jones, which clearly works left-of-center, used to do so with some solid journalism.Not any more.These places (never find fringe publications) are now working with the same standards once reserved for reporting on aliens at Roswell, Elvis sightings and the Illuminati New World Order. It is apparently now within the bounds of mainstream journalism to build a story out of, well, nothing, such as a factoid from 1979, or essentially accuse a presidential candidate of treason based on a single, anonymous source, or claim the Russians have taken over our electoral process based on no sources at all. And Clinton… On the other side, reporting on Clinton by many of these same publications swerves between hagiography and poo-pooing away anything unfavorable. Emails? Who cares! Questions about what her accomplishments as Secretary of State really were? If you ask, you hate women. Pay-for-Play with the Clinton Foundation? Hah, everybody does it, it doesn’t matter. The standard seems to be absent a notarized receipt for a donation matching an arms sale, or a criminal conviction, nothing matters. Next? So be it. The media has fully sh*t the bed this election. That’s where we find ourselves.But what’s next? Will the media reset itself after November 8, or will they run President Trump is Putin’s dog stories for the full term? Will President Clinton be given a pass on, well, everything, for four years, with apologists and explainers on the front page of the Times, never mind in editorials?At what point will the media dig themselves out of this and start real reporting again?

The economic realities of a stagnated economy are weighing heavily upon the masses, and they are looking for outlets to address their anger.\nIf the current protests against the election are any indication, the world is nearing ever closer to destruction, and those who can afford to do so are getting out of the path of violence, mayhem and property destruction ahead of a time. Though the dust will likely settle, the current atmosphere is somewhere between ‘anxious’ and ‘panicked’ :\nvia CBS in Dallas/Fort Worth :\nAn investor group is planning for a doomsday scenario by building a $300 million luxury community replete with underground homes. There will also be air-lock blast doors designed for people worried about a dirty bomb or other disaster and off-grid energy and water production. \nResidents will enjoy an equestrian center, 18-hole golf course, polo fields, zip lines and gun ranges. Retail shops, restaurants and a row of helipads are also in the works. For those looking to “get away,” they’ll also be able to enjoy three white sand beaches and a neighborhood spa .\n“We’ve evolved it into long-term sustainability instead of a survival community,” Trident Lakes CEO Jim O’Connor told the Houston Chronicle, adding that the 400 planned condos will house about 1,600 people.\n“It’s not just a hole in the ground to hide in — it’s going to be one of the most plush resorts in all of Texas, if not America,” Trident Lakes spokesperson Richie Whitt told the Sherman Herald Democrat.\n“People are getting fearful of this world … If need be, it’s going to be one of the safest places on Earth.”\nFor those already living in the luxury class, the expense of the elaborate underground community is not only grandiose, but to me, the extra expense on comfort, entertainment and the focus on above-ground activities only suggests that they are hedging seriously on the possibility that they might have to retreat to these places for considerable time periods.\nWe could use fancy words to describe what’s going on. Or we could just show you our Master Plan. pic.twitter.com/XYesGI7V68 \n— Trident Lakes (@TridentLakes) November 1, 2016 \n\nAt any rate, the 1% has taken cues from Occupy Wall Street, Tea Party protest voters, Black Lives Matter, Bernie supporters and the populist upsurge that elected Trump – namely, that whether or not some or all of these events are manufactured, the population itself has reached the point of revolt and uprising.\nWith such deep-seated anger and division, the wealthy are going to great lengths to ensure that they are able to live comfortably and, if necessary, completely apart from the rest of society.\nThis elitist self-sustaining community will not only set the bar for the rich and well-connected, but for anyone looking to ensure long-term survival through sustainable living that is either off the grid, or not dependent upon it if the grid goes down.\nWhether or not the world ever experiences a nuclear attack or apocalyptic disaster anytime in the foreseeable future, there is every sense that society itself could unravel, and that the disintegrated fabric will spread unrest, violence, riots and ruin for all that it touches.\nAs J.D. Heyes has reported , the elite are preparing their getaways with considerable urgency:\nWith growing inequality and riots such as those in London in 2011 and in Ferguson and other parts of the USA last year, many financial leaders fear they could become targets for public fury. \nThe president of the Institute of New Economic Thinking, Robert Johnson, told attendees at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos (itself, ironically, representative of a class of uber-rich that exists apart from the 99.9 percent of the rest of the world) that a number of hedge fund managers and others with the means to do so were already busy planning their getaway.\n“I know hedge fund managers all over the world who are buying airstrips and farms in places like New Zealand because they think they need a getaway,” he said. \nFood, water, electricity, fuel (and other forms of power), firearms, medicine and skills in everything from agriculture, animal husbandry, mechanics, engine repair, shoes and clothing, tools, hunting and camoflauging will all become vital assets in building that lifeline – and people of all income brackets will need to take measures to prepare, or remain wide open and vulnerable to a society that continues to flirt with total disaster, while scoffing at measures to reduce risk and normalize.\nThe underground shelter market is gaining in size, especially as more and more sectors are preparing to deal with the increasing importance of the threat of EMP attack.\nNotably, engineers just announced the development of ‘conductive concrete,’ which they designed as a low cost way to shield against an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack.With the potential of grid failure and system wide disabling of communications, data centers, military structures, government buildings and more are investing in defensive protections, though theoretically anyone could create their own shielded room or home using these materials:\nAccording to Phys.org :\nNebraska engineers Christopher Tuan and Lim Nguyen have developed a cost-effective concrete that shields against intense pulses of electromagnetic energy, or EMP. Electronics inside structures built or coated with their shielding concrete are protected from EMP. \n“EMP is very lethal to electronic equipment,” said Tuan, professor of civil engineering. “We found a key ingredient that dissipates wave energy. This technology offers a lot of advantages so the construction industry is very interested.” \nEMP-shielding concrete stemmed from Tuan and Nguyen’s partnership to study concrete that conducts electricity [creating] – the ability to block electromagnetic energy.\nTheir technology works by both absorbing and reflecting electromagnetic waves. The team replaced some standard concrete aggregates with their key ingredient – magnetite, a mineral with magnetic properties that absorbs microwaves like a sponge . Their patented recipe includes carbon and metal components for better absorption as well as reflection.\n[…] Today’s shielding technologies employ metal enclosures that require expensive metal panel or screen construction, limiting their feasibility in large structures. […] The resulting patent-pending product protects building interiors from electromagnetic interference, such as radio waves and microwaves, as well as electronic eavesdropping. \nFurthermore, this type of concrete, known as Shotcrete, can be sprayed on over existing structures – meaning that existing buildings can be upgraded for a fraction of the cost of new construction.\nThe wealth gap that divides a few from a country devolving into desperate, revolutionary masses will be nothing compared to the doomsday gap that could follow widespread unrest, violence, war or an EMP attack.\nPrepping has never made more sense.\nRead more: \nLanding Strips, Farms and Hideaways: Secret Escapes of the Elite: “The Rich Are Worried and They Should Be” \nElite Bunker Down in “Secure, Safe Rooms Hidden in Plain Sight”… And You Can, Too \nHow This Man Converted “Underground Shelter Using a 20 Ft.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: As commander-in-chief, shouldn t the Army field manual apply to the president as well as the men and women he commands?Because one psychiatrist brilliantly used the Army field manual to demonstrate that Donald Trump is mentally unfit to be president.Dr. Prudence L. Gourguechon wrote an editorial for the Los Angeles Times detailing how Trump s behavior makes him an unfit leader and she proved it by consulting the field manual used by the United States Army.After pointing out that the 25th Amendment of the Constitution has been getting a lot of attention recently because of Trump s behavior, Dr. Gourguechon said that after searching through  thousands of articles and books written on leadership, primarily in the business arena, I have found only one source where the capacities necessary for strategic leadership are clearly and comprehensively laid out: the U.S. Army s  Field Manual 6-22 Leader Development. That is particularly interesting since Trump is the commander of America s armed forces.Specifically, the manual discusses the areas of trust, discipline and self-control, judgement and critical thinking, self-awareness, and empathy. And as Dr. Gourguechon notes, Trump fails in every category.On trust, the manual states that  Leaders shape the ethical climate of their organization while developing the trust and relationships that enable proper leadership. Gouguechon elaborated.A leader who is deficient in the capacity for trust makes little effort to support others, may be isolated and aloof, may be apathetic about discrimination, allows distrustful behaviors to persist among team members, makes unrealistic promises and focuses on self-promotion.As we know, Trump doesn t trust people and he sows an environment of distrust. And let s not pretend that Trump hasn t made unrealistic promises or promoted himself.On discipline and self-control, the manual mentions traits such as selflessness, respect, integrity, and courage. If you are laughing, it s because you know that Trump has none of these traits. In fact, he is the most undisciplined and selfish person on the planet. Or at the very least the most undisciplined and selfish person who has ever lived in the White House. Without discipline and self-control, a leader may not be able to resist temptation, to stay focused despite distractions, to avoid impulsive action or to think before jumping to a conclusion,  Dr. Gourguechon wrote.  The leader who fails to demonstrate discipline reacts  viscerally or angrily when receiving bad news or conflicting information,  and he  allows personal emotions to drive decisions or guide responses to emotionally charged situations. On judgement and critical thinking, the manual makes it clear that Trump has no business being the commander-in-chief.A leader with the capacity for critical thinking  seeks to obtain the most thorough and accurate understanding possible,  the manual says, and he anticipates  first, second and third consequences of multiple courses of action.  A leader deficient in judgment and strategic thinking demonstrates rigid and inflexible thinking.The manual also makes it clear that Trump lacks self-awareness. It describes him perfectly. Self-aware leaders know themselves, including their traits, feelings, and behaviors,  the manual says.  They employ self-understanding and recognize their effect on others.  When a leader lacks self-awareness, the manual notes, he  unfairly blames subordinates when failures are experienced  and  rejects or lacks interest in feedback. The same goes for empathy.A good leader  demonstrates an understanding of another person s point of view  and  identifies with others  feelings and emotions.  The manual s description of inadequacy in this area:  Shows a lack of concern for others  emotional distress  and  displays an inability to take another s perspective. So if we go by the military leadership standards outlined in the Army field manual, Trump should be removed from office as soon as possible. He definitely should not have been allowed to take office in the first place. Americans need to take Trump s behavior seriously. He literally controls the most powerful military in the world, and the military would never voluntarily make him their leader if they follow this manual. That speaks volumes.Featured Image: Ralph Freso/Getty Images", "output": "0. Fake"}

{"instruction": "Task: Please determine whether the text is 0. False, 1. TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Email \nEvery four years, Americans are treated to a tawdry, months-long spectacle pitting two typically (but not always) establishment-anointed candidates against one another for the ultimate prize: a four-year stint as the “most powerful person on Earth.” That, at least, is the establishment media’s term for the president of the United States. And it would have appalled the Founding Fathers and framers of the Constitution, who never intended to create in the office of the U.S. presidency a magistracy far more powerful than the English monarchy they had only recently shaken off. \nBut the de facto reality of modern America is that the executive branch of the U.S. government has usurped an enormous portion of government powers reserved by the Constitution in its original form to other branches of the federal government or to state governments. The president, for example, now sends U.S. troops into war at his personal whim, completely ignoring the constitutional stipulation that Congress issue a declaration of war first. A huge percentage of federal laws that control virtually every activity are issued in the form of federal regulations — which are created not by the legislative but by the executive branch of government, under the direction of the president. \nThe president also wields tremendous power with his authority to nominate Supreme Court justices — since the Supreme Court is regarded as a body whose decisions cannot be appealed or overturned. Presidents from FDR to the present have tried to customize the court to their preferred ideology, and the court has responded by issuing a range of unpopular decisions, from abortion on demand to the recent vindication of ObamaCare, that have left ordinary Americans frustrated and angry. By all accounts, the will of the people is systematically ignored by Washington, and there appears to be nothing that can change this state of affairs. This is the reason that every presidential race has become the ultimate high-stakes battle of partisan wills; the winner — and his party — will wield enormous de facto (if not de jure) power over the affairs of the nation and the world, and has the ability, via Supreme Court appointments, executive orders, involvement in foreign wars, regulations, and many other powers now accorded to him, to shape the destiny of the nation decades after his term in office ends. \nIn recent decades, most of the power in government has migrated from Congress — the only part of the government truly elected by the people — to the two unelected branches of government, the executive branch and the Supreme Court. In particular, the power to legislate has largely been usurped by the executive branch via a noxious system of federal regulatory agencies staffed by unelected bureaucrats wielding enormous, unaccountable power, and by an unelected Supreme Court that does not hesitate to legislate from the bench. The sheer volume and scope of federal regulations promulgated every year far surpasses the number of laws passed by Congress. \nIn its original form, things were far different. The Founders intended Congress to be the most powerful branch of government, with the Senate representing the interests of the states and the House of Representatives those of the people. The president was largely a caretaker. Bereft of any “bully pulpit,” “big stick,” or other tools of modern American autocracy, he largely acted under the direction of Congress, which, in turn, carried out the will of the people and of the state legislatures. The executive branch as a whole was primarily concerned with foreign affairs and with adjudicating disputes between the states. Few Americans prior to the early 20th century had any contact with the federal government other than at the post office, and many would not have recognized the president had they passed him on the street. \nToday, of course, the U.S. president is the superstar of superstars, an elected Caesar who controls the destinies of billions, thanks to his ascendency over the U.S. military and economy. Small wonder that Americans focus all their combative energies on getting “their man” elected. In the modern American game of thrones, the presidency has become the ultimate spoils. \nBut there are constitutional remedies for all of this. The Constitution has not yet been repealed or amended beyond recognition — though there are many who are pushing to do just that, via a modern constitutional convention. And the Constitution provides a series of ingenious remedies, some of them all but forgotten, for the disfigurement of our original checks and balances that generations of unscrupulous political elites have created. Here are a few of them. \nCut the Purse Strings \nNo federal program can operate without funding, and on paper at least, the House of Representatives still holds the purse strings for the entire government, as the Founders intended it to. As the first clause in the Constitution, Article 1, Section 7, clearly stipulates, “All bills for raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.” The House of Representatives, be it remembered, was designed to represent the voice of the people directly; this is why House members are reelected more often than any other officials in the federal government (every two years), and also why House members have the smallest constituencies. To change the direction of the federal government, it is first necessary to change the House, and it just happens that it is the House where turnover is the highest and candidacy the easiest. The House being the largest elected body in government, it is impossible for all House races to be controlled by special interests (although many of them certainly are). \nAll this being the case, the House is the first line of defense against an abusive and overweening executive branch. If the House refuses to authorize spending for a given bill, program, initiative, or policy, it will not be funded. \nWhat if the president ignores Congress, and uses unauthorized funds, as the Clinton administration did in the 1995 bailout of the Mexican government? In 1995, President Clinton, frustrated by Congress’ refusal to authorize an emergency bailout of the Mexican economy to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in loan guarantees, went ahead and did it anyway. These funds were taken from a then little-known fund controlled by the Treasury Department, the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), which was created in 1934 as part of the Gold Reserve Act, to provide emergency funds to shore up the dollar in the event of severe foreign exchange fluctuations. The ESF was made necessary by the United States’ departure from the gold standard, along with most other countries, during the 1930s. Absent the discipline and stability imposed by a precious-metal standard, currency values are prone to wild swings as governments engage in various inflationary policies. With the passage of decades, the central banks of the world have learned to coordinate their inflationary policies in secret, but the ESF remains, and as of 2009, held more than $100 billion — enough to fund a significant amount of presidential financial and economic priorities, should Congress demur. \nAnother clever way that the executive branch has discovered for circumventing congressional checks on funding is via Department of Justice lawsuits. This trick has been used to particular effect by the Obama administration, and it works like this: The Justice Department launches a lawsuit for perceived violations of federal regulations (bank regulations, for example) against a well-heeled target or targets, and as part of the settlement, directs large payments to be made to selected special interests — for example, anti-bank activist groups. Hundreds of millions of off-budget dollars have been funneled to a wide panoply of leftist activist groups in this way, in return for their support of Obama’s anti-business policies. Of particular notoriety is the Obama administration’s recent disposal of hundreds of millions in settlement monies from the likes of Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan, of which an appreciable amount was permitted, under Justice’s terms of settlement, to be “donated” to various activist groups that serve the Democratic Party’s interests. This money all belongs, in theory, to the Treasury, and therefore cannot be disposed of without Congress’ say-so. In fact, Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution anticipated the potential for executive monkeyshines with Treasury funds, stipulating that “no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law; and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time.” But that hasn’t stopped the Obama administration from using vast sums of extortion payments originating in legal settlements to finance many left-wing NGO (non-governmental organization) allies. \nThe executive branch has devised and continues to devise methods to circumvent constitutional prohibitions on executive authority to raise money. For as one congressman closely allied with President Grover Cleveland is alleged to have told a fellow congressman who criticized one of his initiatives as unconstitutional, “What’s the Constitution between friends?” \nBut can Congress do anything about it? All executive expenditures, from the constitutionally dubious ESF to DOJ settlement monies, must originate with the Treasury — but, as the Constitution makes crystal clear, although the Treasury pertains to the executive branch, its funds cannot be disbursed without congression­al authorization. It is this stipulation, even more than the “origination” clause in Article 1, Section 7, that assigns the purse strings ultimately and unavoidably to Congress. \nAll Congress needs to do in cases of executive innovation, such as the creative use of DOJ settlement monies, is to pass a law clarifying constitutional limits on Treasury spending. In the case of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, it could simply legislate the unneeded entity out of existence, for example. In the case of the DOJ settlement slush fund, legislation outlawing such practices is already working its way through Congress. \nThe framers of the Constitution anticipated that the executive branch would seek to raise funds by going around Congress. This is why the Constitution makes plain that measures for raising revenue must originate in the House, and that no money may be spent from the Treasury except by congressional authorization. \nThis congressional authorization applies not only to money raised by taxes, but to all other ways the government has to raise money. In the latter category the most traditional way, of course, is borrowing money. Since the beginning of the Republic, this has been accomplished by the issuance of various “Treasuries,” financial instruments such as Treasury bonds that can be purchased by anyone wishing to loan money to the U.S. government in the hope of achieving a modest return upon maturation. The Constitution delegates the authority to “borrow money on the credit of the United States” to Congress in Article 1, Section 8. Yet this power was quickly delegated to the secretary of the treasury upon ratification of the Constitution, in 1789, and has been carried out by the Treasury, ostensibly under congression­al oversight, ever since. Today, all decisions made regarding the issuance of debt emanate from the Office of Debt Management (ODM) within the Treasury. Congress takes little notice of the day-to-day operations of this office, which has broad discretionary power to issue as much or as little debt as it sees fit, constrained only by the congressionally mandated debt limit — which Congress raises as frequently as political pressure, mostly orchestrated by the executive branch, demands. In other words, even though the Constitution assigns responsibility for the issuance of debt — as with all other fiscal powers — to Congress, the legislative body has delegated almost all of its authority over the creation of debt to the executive, reassuring itself that its authority remains supreme as long as the constantly rising debt ceiling limits are respected. Added to this is the fact that a large part of U.S. Treasury debt ends up being monetized by the Federal Reserve, an entity under neither presidential nor congressional control, whose financial activities are completely opaque to Congress and the president alike. In practice, though, the Fed is an ally of the executive branch, inasmuch as its “open market operations” (the purchase and sale of Treasury-issued debt on the secondary markets) has created a vast and constant demand for government debt that would not exist were private investors and foreign governments the Treasury Department’s only customers. \nThus the executive branch may have little de facto authority to raise revenue directly, but it has come to enjoy — thanks to two centuries of congressional neglect — enormous and almost unchallenged de facto power over the issuance of debt, buttressed by the modern Federal Reserve System, and restrained only by occasional feeble congressional blandishments regarding the debt ceiling. \nThis is a much knottier problem than reining in executive abuse of Treasury funds. It will require nothing less than the repeal of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and the re-assertion of congressional responsibility for the issuance of debt. The transfer of the ODM and its operations to full and constant congressional oversight via the congressional Ways and Means Committee would be a good start in this regard, as would the instatement of a robust, long-term debt ceiling. But the best measure of all would be to begin shrinking the size and cost of government to within constitutionally mandated limits, and to pay down the massive debt that is now used as a political weapon to hold the entire country hostage — usually by ambitious, big-spending presidents and their allies in Congress. \nOther Remedies \nBut what if the president starts another war? War is a powerful political distractor and disincentive for dissent. The laws, as Cicero once observed, have a tendency to fall silent in times of war. In our time, the very waging of war has become a lawless act, since no U.S. president since FDR, at the onset of World War II, has gone to war authorized by a congressional declaration. The Korean, Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars have all been waged by presidential edict, as have countless smaller military actions from the former Yugoslavia to Haiti to Panama to Libya, among many others. The constitutional authority to declare war, delegated to Congress in Article 1, Section 8, has become all but a dead letter, not by direct repeal but by decades of congressional spinelessness and public apathy. For 15 years, the United States has been engaged in a series of international wars under the banner of a “War on Terror,” costing trillions of dollars and thousands of lives, without a constitutionally mandated declaration against any hostile power — and with no end in sight. Quite aside from the horrific human toll, the vaguely defined, open-ended War on Terror has created a constant rationale for more and more debt, mostly urged on a reluctant Congress and ever-more-hard-beset American people by an executive branch energized by the prospect of war without end. \nThe solution to the executive war card is simple, but will require considerable political will: restore the congressional declaration of war as a check on the war-making ambitions of the executive branch. This would include determining whether America’s seemingly endless involvement in Middle Eastern broils is worthy of a declaration of war, and winding down our commitments in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan once and for all if it isn’t. Such would not lead to instant relief from our gargantuan war debts, but it would be a huge step in the right direction, reducing the likelihood of future foreign wars for our descendants to die in and pay for. \nHow can we stop the growth of federal regulations by unelected bureaucrats? The easiest way would be for Congress to legislatively shut down and defund the departments and agencies that produce them. For decades, conservatives have vowed to close various executive branch departments, with the Department of Education a perennial favorite. But because of public apathy, such promises have not been kept. \nWhat about the Supreme Court? Another area in which the executive branch, bolstered by a sympathetic majority in Congress, might seem unstoppable is in the matter of Supreme Court appointees. One of the major self-justifications of the Trump campaign has been that a President Hillary Clinton will stack the Court with ultra-liberal justices who will roll back the gains of the Scalia/Roberts court, ensuring that abortion on demand continues and possibly overturning the recent ruling in favor of an expansive interpretation of the Second Amendment under the District of Columbia v. Heller. But the actions of the Republican-controlled Senate have already shown how such concerns can be exaggerated. The Senate notified President Obama after the untimely death of Justice Antonin Scalia that it would not consider any of his nominations so close to a presidential election. Despite withering pressure from Democrats and the kept media, Senate Republicans have been as good as their word — so far. Left out of the discussion, however, is that there is no constitutional stipulation on the number of Supreme Court justices, nor even that the number be odd to ensure a tiebreaker vote. The original Supreme Court had six justices, requiring that a tiebreaker be by a two-thirds majority (four out of six). Such a configuration was itself a powerful limit on the ability of the Supreme Court to impose its will. But there is nothing save perhaps an act of legislation that prevents the Supreme Court from returning to such an arrangement — or to any other number of judges Congress might deem appropriate. \nBut aside from the number of justices, Congress possesses an even more powerful check against the Supreme Court. One of official Washington’s best-kept secrets is the fact that the Constitution provides, in Article 3, Section 2, for Congress to limit the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The precise wording of this oft-overlooked provision is: In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction . In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction , both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make. [Emphasis added.] \nIn other words, Congress may pass legislation instructing the Supreme Court that it has no jurisdiction over cases involving, for example, gun rights or abortion. In this way, a court deemed a threat to the body politic could be hamstrung. In practice, this option has seldom been used, and is almost never discussed in “respectable” Washington circles, because it poses a mortal threat to the legal hegemony the supremes have enjoyed for so long — usually to the advantage of Big Government and their cultural Marxist allies. Indeed, Congress might easily have gotten rid of ObamaCare by now if it had chosen this option instead of relying on the Supreme Court — which, of course, refused to find yet another Big Government program unconstitutional. \nIf All Else Fails? \nFrom time to time, presidents (and Supreme Court justices) simply refuse to acknowledge limits on their power, and persist in defying the will of the people and the authority of Congress. In such cases, there is one final recourse: impeachment and removal from office. Congress has been reluctant to exercise this option, but were it used more freely, presidents and Supreme Court justices would be much more leery of abusing their powers. \nIn short, there is an array of options available to keep the executive and judicial branches from running roughshod over Congress and the American people. The only thing required is better understanding of the Constitution’s intricate checks and balances and the political will to put them into effect. \n\nThis article is an example of the exclusive content that's available by subscribing to our print magazine.

A Government of Scoundrels, Spies, Thieves, Ruffians, Rapists and Killers “There is nothing more dangerous than a government of the many controlled by the few.”— Lawrence Le... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/a-government-of-scoundrels-spies.html “There is nothing more dangerous than a government of the many controlled by the few.”— Lawrence Lessig, Harvard law professor The U.S. government remains the greatest threat to our freedoms. The systemic violence being perpetrated by agents of the government has done more collective harm to the American people and our liberties than any single act of terror. More than terrorism, more than domestic extremism, more than gun violence and organized crime, the U.S. government has become a greater menace to the life, liberty and property of its citizens than any of the so-called dangers from which the government claims to protect us. Image: They Live film This is how tyranny rises and freedom falls. As I explain in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , when the government views itself as superior to the citizenry, when it no longer operates for the benefit of the people, when the people are no longer able to peacefully reform their government, when government officials cease to act like public servants, when elected officials no longer represent the will of the people, when the government routinely violates the rights of the people and perpetrates more violence against the citizenry than the criminal class, when government spending is unaccountable and unaccounted for, when the judiciary act as courts of order rather than justice, and when the government is no longer bound by the laws of the Constitution, then you no longer have a government “of the people, by the people and for the people.” What we have is a government of wolves . Worse than that, we are now being ruled by a government of scoundrels, spies, thugs, thieves, gangsters, ruffians, rapists, extortionists, bounty hunters, battle-ready warriors and cold-blooded killers who communicate using a language of force and oppression. Does the government pose a danger to you and your loved ones? The facts speak for themselves. We’re being held at gunpoint by a government of soldiers — a standing army. While Americans are being made to jump through an increasing number of hoops in order to exercise their Second Amendment right to own a gun, the government is arming its own civilian employees to the hilt with guns, ammunition and military-style equipment, authorizing them to make arrests, and training them in military tactics. Among the agencies being supplied with night-vision equipment, body armor, hollow-point bullets, shotguns, drones, assault rifles and LP gas cannons are the Smithsonian, U.S. Mint, Health and Human Services, IRS , FDA, Small Business Administration, Social Security Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Education Department, Energy Department, Bureau of Engraving and Printing and an assortment of public universities. There are now reportedly more bureaucratic (non-military) government civilians armed with high-tech, deadly weapons than U.S. Marines. That doesn’t even begin to touch on the government’s arsenal, the transformation of local police into extensions of the military, and the speed with which the nation could be locked down under martial law depending on the circumstances. Clearly, the government is preparing for war — and a civil war, at that — but who is the enemy? We’re being robbed blind by a government of thieves . Americans no longer have any real protection against government agents empowered to seize private property at will. For instance, police agencies under the guise of asset forfeiture laws are taking property based on little more than a suspicion of criminal activity. In one case, police seized $53,000 from the manager of a Christian rock band that was touring and raising money for an orphanage in Thailand. Despite finding no evidence of wrongdoing, police kept the money. Homeowners are losing their homes over nonpayment of taxes ( for as little as $400 owed ) and municipal bills such as water or sewer fees that amount to a fraction of what they have invested in their homes. And then there’s the Drug Enforcement Agency, which has been searching train and airline passengers and pocketing their cash , without ever charging them with a crime. We’re being taken advantage of by a government of scoundrels, idiots and cowards. American satirist H.L. Mencken calculated that “Congress consists of one-third, more or less, scoundrels; two-thirds, more or less, idiots; and three-thirds, more or less, poltroons.” By and large, Americans seem to agree . When you’ve got government representatives who spend a large chunk of their work hours fundraising , being feted by lobbyists, shuffling through a lucrative revolving door between public service and lobbying, and making themselves available to anyone with enough money to secure access to a congressional office , you’re in the clutches of a corrupt oligarchy . Mind you, these same elected officials rarely read the legislation they’re enacting, nor do they seem capable of enacting much legislation that actually helps rather than hinders the plight of the American citizen. We’re being locked up by a government of greedy jailers . We have become a carceral state , spending three times more on our prisons than on our schools and imprisoning close to a quarter of the world’s prisoners , despite the fact that crime is at an all-time low and the U.S. makes up only 5% of the world’s population. The Prison Industry in the United States: Big Business or a New Form of Slavery? Which is in contrast with... Netherlands is Closing 19 Prisons Because of Criminal Shortage . The rise of overcriminalization and profit-driven private prisons provides even greater incentives for locking up American citizens for such non-violent “crimes” as having an overgrown lawn . As the Boston Review points out, “America’s contemporary system of policing, courts, imprisonment, and parole … makes money through asset forfeiture, lucrative public contracts from private service providers, and by directly extracting revenue and unpaid labor from populations of color and the poor. In states and municipalities throughout the country, the criminal justice system defrays costs by forcing prisoners and their families to pay for punishment. It also allows private service providers to charge outrageous fees for everyday needs such as telephone calls. As a result people facing even minor criminal charges can easily find themselves trapped in a self-perpetuating cycle of debt, criminalization, and incarceration.” We’re being spied on by a government of Peeping Toms . The government is watching everything you do, reading everything you write, listening to everything you say, and monitoring everything you spend. This is George Orwell's 1984 on steroids. Omnipresent surveillance is paving the way for government programs that profile citizens, document their behavior and attempt to predict what they might do in the future, whether it’s what they might buy, what politician they might support, or what kinds of crimes they might commit . The impact of this far-reaching surveillance, according to Psychology Today, is “ reduced trust, increased conformity, and even diminished civic participation .” As technology analyst Jillian C. York concludes, “Mass surveillance without due process — whether undertaken by the government of Bahrain, Russia, the US, or anywhere in between — threatens to stifle and smother that dissent, leaving in its wake a populace cowed by fear .” We’re being ravaged by a government of ruffians, rapists and killers . It’s not just the police shootings of unarmed citizens that are worrisome. It’s the SWAT team raids gone wrong that are leaving innocent citizens wounded, children terrorized and family pets killed. For trying to run from the principal’s office . For, at the age of 12, getting into a fight with another girl . We’re being forced to surrender our freedoms — and those of our children — to a government of extortionists, money launderers and professional pirates . The American people have been repeatedly sold a bill of goods about how the government needs more money, more expansive powers, and more secrecy (secret courts, secret budgets , secret military campaigns, secret surveillance) in order to keep us safe. Under the guise of fighting its wars on terror, drugs and now domestic extremism, the government has spent billions in taxpayer dollars on endless wars that have not ended terrorism but merely sown the seeds of blowback, surveillance programs that have caught few terrorists while subjecting all Americans to a surveillance society, and militarized police that have done little to decrease crime while turning communities into warzones. Not surprisingly, the primary ones to benefit from these government exercises in legal money laundering have been the corporations, lobbyists and politicians who inflict them on a trusting public. Whatever else it may be — a danger, a menace, a threat — the U.S. government is certainly no friend to freedom. To our detriment, the criminal class that Mark Twain mockingly referred to as Congress has since expanded to include every government agency that feeds off the carcass of our once-constitutional republic. In fact, there’s a very good reason you don’t hear much in the way of specifics about the government’s tyranny from politicians: it’s because they can’t afford to upset the apple cart (i.e., jeopardize their posh lifestyles). So no matter which party wins the White House, controls Congress or appoints future Supreme Court justices, rest assured that the menace of the shadow government — the permanent, unelected bureaucracy that operates beyond the reach of the Constitution, the courts and the citizenry — will continue uninterrupted. Our backs are against the proverbial wall. The government and its cohorts have conspired to ensure that the only real recourse the American people have to express their displeasure with the government is through voting, which is no real recourse at all. The penalties for civil disobedience, whistleblowing and rebellion are severe. If you refuse to pay taxes for government programs you believe to be immoral or illegal, you will go to jail. If you attempt to overthrow the government — or any agency thereof — because you believe it has overstepped its reach, you will go to jail. If you attempt to blow the whistle on government misconduct, there’s a pretty good chance you will go to jail. For too long, the American people have been made to act like puppets dancing to a tyrant’s tune. We have obeyed the government’s dictates, no matter now extreme. We have paid its taxes, penalties and fines, no matter how outrageous. We have tolerated its indignities, insults and abuses, no matter how egregious. We have turned a blind eye to its indiscretions and incompetence, no matter how imprudent. We have held our silence in the face of its lawlessness, licentiousness and corruption, no matter how illicit. We have suffered. How long we will continue to suffer depends on how much we’re willing to give up for the sake of freedom. America’s founders provided us with a very specific explanation about the purpose of government and a roadmap for what to do when the government abuses its authority, ignores our objections, and establishes itself as a tyrant. We must choose between peaceful slavery (in other words, maintaining the status quo in servitude to the police state) and dangerous freedom . That will mean carving out a path in which we begin to take ownership of our government, starting at the local level, challenging the status quo, and raising hell whenever a government official steps out of line.

TrueAnswer directly without explanations.", "input": "Text: Yesterday, The New York Times ran a story in which they gave moving accounts of two women who say that Donald Trump sexually assaulted them. Trump maintains that his boasts about being allowed to assault women because he s got star power were just words, and that he s never done such a thing. In a sorry attempt to maintain the illusion that he s a good person, Trump has had his lawyers send the Times an official cease-and-desist, claiming the story amounts to libel.The strange thing is that the bulk of this letter appears to be directed at the women that the Times spoke to than it is to the Times itself: [Y]ou apparently performed an entirely inadequate investigation to test the veracity of these false and malicious allegations, including why these two individuals waited, in one case, 11 years, and, in another case, more than three decades, before deciding to come forward with these false and defamatory statements. And there it is. Assassinating the characters of the victims by saying that, if they d really been assaulted sexually, they d have come forward right away, is a very typical ploy for those trying to defend themselves against such allegations. But there s still nothing in there about what, specifically, is false in the Times  story and how they know the Times knowingly published a false story.Trump s victims could all find their names and characters dragged through the mud because of this, and make no mistake, he will do that as loudly as he can. The fear of having that happen, and of not being believed, keeps many sexual assault victims from coming forward.And that could easily be why Trump is doing this. However, his method appears to be two-fold: In addition to intimidating and bullying his victims, he s also intimidating and bullying press outlets. The hope there would be that they won t give a voice to any more of his victims out of fear of getting sued.This isn t the only absurdity in the letter, but it is the most damning, given its possible intent. The letter also makes it political instead of naming specific falsehoods, which is outright ridiculous if this is a serious cease-and-desist: Your article is reckless, defamatory and constitutes libel per se. It is apparent from, among other things, the timing of the article, that it is nothing more than a politically-motivated effort to defeat Mr. Trump s candidacy Clearly, The New York Times is willing to provide a platform to anyone wishing to smear Mr. Trump s name and reputation prior to the election irrespective of whether the alleged statements have any basis in fact. Really? That s a hell of a thing to say in a cease-and-desist. The letter itself is politically motivated   it s actually quite difficult to believe that an actual lawyer wrote this baloney. Here s what a strong cease-and-desist letter should contain, and this is a template of a decent cease-and-desist. This idiocy meets none of the conditions it needs to.CNNMoney reports that Trump has also threatened the Palm Beach Post for publishing a separate story from yet another victim. Besides that, the Trump campaign told Times reporter Megan Twohey that he would sue if they published the story. She received her own letter yesterday afternoon and was called a  disgusting human being. A lawsuit against the Times would uncover everything and probably sink Trump entirely, because these allegations are the tip of the iceberg. He knows that. But, if nothing else, the discovery phase of this would be interesting.You can read the letter in full here:BREAKING: Trump demands retraction from @nytimes, threatens lawsuit.https://t.co/GBwomM7tgA pic.twitter.com/Htm9uaEsne  Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) October 13, 2016Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images", "output": "0.

While the intelligence docu-dump supposedly sheds additional light on covert war programs, psychic research and the Cold War era, it also contains more evidence confirming the symbiotic relationship between the CIA and American media. In late January the UK s Guardian reported that the CIA themselves released millions of documents online: The CIA has published more than 12 million pages of declassified documents online, making decades of US intelligence files more easily accessible and searchable.The agency published the roughly 930,000 documents that make up the CIA Records Search Tool (Crest) on Tuesday. The online publication of the files was first reported by BuzzFeed News. Although all of the documents in Crest were part of the public record before Tuesday, they could only be inspected by visiting the National Archives in Maryland in person. Once at the archives, just four computers available only during business hours provided access to Crest. A lawsuit from the open-government nonprofit MuckRock prompted the CIA to make the documents available online. Further pressure to publish the documents came from the transparency advocate and journalist Michael Best, who began steadily scanning and uploading the documents one by one. Continuing, the Guardian reported that the CIA also kept files and documents on media organizations and individual reporters. In 2014, Best from MuckRock, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit in order to get the CIA to post all of its documents online. Along the way, Best reportedly crowd-funded more than $15000 to  print out and then publicly upload the records, one by one, to apply pressure to the CIA. Although some mainstream outlets have been somewhat congratulatory of the CIA, many of the files released remain heavily redacted.In the early 1950 s, the CIA ran a wide-scale program called Operation Mockingbird that was said to have infiltrated the American news media in particular, which propagandized the public through various front organizations, magazines and cultural groups.

(Image Source: zerohedge.com)In recent years, there has been a series of surreal and unreal news stories since the Smith-Mundt Act was effectively rendered obsolete by US lawmakers on July 2nd 2013, as published by RT below: Until earlier this month, a longstanding federal law made it illegal for the US Department of State to share domestically the internally-authored news stories sent to American-operated outlets broadcasting around the globe. All of that changed effective July 2, when the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) was given permission to let US households tune-in to hear the type of programming that has previously only been allowed in outside nations. The Smith-Mundt Act has ensured for decades that government-made media intended for foreign audiences doesn t end up on radio networks broadcast within the US. An amendment tagged onto the National Defense Authorization Act removed that prohibition this year.

Dulles, director of the CIA. By this time, Operation Mockingbird had a major influence over 25 newspapers and wire agencies. The usual methodology was placing reports developed from intelligence provided by the CIA to witting or unwitting reporters. Those reports would then be repeated or cited by the preceding reporters which in turn would then be cited throughout the media wire services.The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) was funded by siphoning off funds intended for the Marshall Plan [i.e. the rebuilding of Europe by the U.S. after WWII]. Some of this money was used to bribe journalists and publishers.In 2008, the New York Times wrote:During the early years of the cold war, [prominent writers and artists, from Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to Jackson Pollock] were supported, sometimes lavishly, always secretly, by the C.I.A. as part of its propaganda war against the Soviet Union. It was perhaps the most successful use of  soft power  in American history.A CIA operative told Washington Post owner Philip Graham   in a conversation about the willingness of journalists to peddle CIA propaganda and cover stories:You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl, for a couple hundred dollars a month.Famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein wrote in 1977:More than 400 American journalists   in the past twenty five years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents on file at CIA headquarters.***In many instances, CIA documents show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America s leading news organizations.***Among the executives who lent their cooperation to the Agency were [the heads of CBS, Time, the New York Times, the Louisville Courier Journal, and Copley News Service. Other organizations which cooperated with the CIA include [ABC, NBC, AP, UPI, Reuters], Hearst Newspapers, Scripps Howard, Newsweek magazine, the Mutual Broadcasting System, the Miami Herald and the old Saturday Evening Post and New York Herald Tribune.***There is ample evidence that America s leading publishers and news executives allowed themselves and their organizations to become handmaidens to the intelligence services.  Let s not pick on some poor reporters, for God s sake,  William Colby exclaimed at one point to the Church committee s investigators.  Let s go to the managements.***The CIA even ran a formal training program in the 1950s to teach its agents to be journalists. Intelligence officers were  taught to make noises like reporters,  explained a high CIA official, and were then placed in major news organizations with help from management.***Once a year during the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS correspondents joined the CIA hierarchy for private dinners and briefings.***Allen Dulles often interceded with his good friend, the late Henry Luce, founder of Time and Life magazines, who readily allowed certain members of his staff to work for the Agency and agreed to provide jobs and credentials for other CIA operatives who lacked journalistic experience.***In the 1950s and early 1960s, Time magazine s foreign correspondents attended CIA  briefing  dinners similar to those the CIA held for CBS.***When Newsweek was purchased by the Washington Post Company, publisher Philip L. Graham was informed by Agency officials that the CIA occasionally used the magazine for cover purposes, according to CIA sources.  It was widely known that Phil Graham was somebody you could get help from,  said a former deputy director of the Agency.  Frank Wisner dealt with him.  Wisner, deputy director of the CIA from 1950 until shortly before his suicide in 1965, was the Agency s premier orchestrator of  black  operations, including many in which journalists were involved. Wisner liked to boast of his  mighty Wurlitzer,  a wondrous propaganda instrument he built, and played, with help from the press.)***In November 1973, after [the CIA claimed to have ended the program], Colby told reporters and editors from the New York Times and the Washington Star that the Agency had  some three dozen  American newsmen  on the CIA payroll,  including five who worked for  general circulation news organizations.  Yet even while the Senate Intelligence Committee was holding its hearings in 1976, according to high level CIA sources, the CIA continued to maintain ties with seventy five to ninety journalists of every description executives, reporters, stringers, photographers, columnists, bureau clerks and members of broadcast technical crews. More than half of these had been moved off CIA contracts and payrolls but they were still bound by other secret agreements with the Agency. According to an unpublished report by the House Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired by Representative Otis Pike, at least fifteen news organizations were still providing cover for CIA operatives as of 1976.***Those officials most knowledgeable about the subject say that a figure of 400 American journalists is on the low side  . There were a lot of representations that if this stuff got out some of the biggest names in journalism would get smeared   .An expert on propaganda testified under oath during trial that the CIA now employs THOUSANDS of reporters and OWNS its own media organizations. Whether or not his estimate is accurate, it is clear that many prominent reporters still report to the CIA.A 4-part BBC documentary called the  Century of the Self  shows that an American   Freud s nephew, Edward Bernays   created the modern field of manipulation of public perceptions, and the U.S. government has extensively used his techniques.More from Washington s Blog here READ MORE PROPAGANDA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Propaganda FilesREAD MORE PENTAGON NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Pentagon FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE by subscribing and becoming a MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV", "output": "0.

He s now a Class 2 director on the board of Reynolds American Inc, the company that makes his beloved Camel cigarettes. Yes, his job will be to lobby Congress to help prevent and eliminate those pesky regulations that tobacco companies have to jump through   you know, like the ones that say the tobacco companies can t market to children, although a Boehner spokesman spun it to sound like just the opposite. RAI is striving to transform the tobacco industry through innovative strategies that include speeding the decline in tobacco use among young people and reducing the harm caused by smoking,  said a Boehner spokesman.  These are objectives Speaker Boehner supports and looks forward to helping RAI advance through his service on the board. Source: NPRHere s the video:The reality is much bleaker. There is a tiny grain of truth in the statement that fewer young people are using tobacco, but one of the things tobacco companies are trying to sell as a safer alternative to tobacco are e-cigarettes, which for children, are even worse than traditional cigarettes, just because the cartridge can be broken and children have been known to swallow toxic doses of nicotine.Not only that, tobacco companies are specifically marketing e-cigarettes to young children, often with ads touting their candy-like flavors.If you recall, Boehner stepped down from his speakership and announced that he would be leaving Congress immediately after a congressional visit from Pope Francis. He seemed to imply that the Pope had put the  pro-life  Speaker into a crisis of conscious. In truth, Republicans wanted him out, badly, but what happened to the man who claimed his life was changed after meeting the Pope?Nothing that the Pope would approve of. Smoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in this country. Nearly half a million Americans die from smoking ever year. While not as many children are picking up cigarettes, hence the panic and the hiring of Boehner, more than 3,200 new smokers each day are younger than 18. Of those, 2,100 will become addicts. This is what John Boehner is promoting. He s almost better back in Congress. At least there, he got nothing done. Now, he ll be personally responsible for the deaths of millions and he ll be pushing cigarettes on children.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.", "output": "0. Fake"}

They reveal the story of the world economy. Central bankers have done their best to conjure forth inflation in the hopes that this will vanquish deflation but the risk is that our daily lives, and the sustainability of governments, will be affected by an ongoing battle between these two forces. There will be important consequences. Quantitative Easing is now catching people in a vice by pushing up their cost of living even as their income is still falling. This breaks the vital social contracts between citizens and their governments and sets in motion many seemingly unrelated outcomes: social unrest in emerging markets, the movement of manufacturing and jobs back to the US and the West, improvements to the value added of emerging market firms, higher food and energy prices. The rising price, but shrinking size, of a steak, a candy bar and an apartment not only cause pain at home, they also propel some nations to deploy their militaries to secure resources and protect their citizens from the ill effects of inflation and deflation alike. This is already resulting in military confrontations, incidents and near misses between American, Chinese and Russian planes, warships and submarines. The solution is growth and innovation. Luckily, anonymous individuals are balancing their hubris against the risk of failure and proceeding to build a more dynamic economy and the new social contracts that will exist tomorrow. The only question is whether governments are hostile or hospitable to these efforts. By being alert to the many signals around us anyone can better navigate through the turbulence to the treasures of the world economy instead of being continuously overwhelmed and surprised by it. \nAll the Presidents’ Bankers: The Hidden Alliances that Drive American Power – Who rules America? \nAll the Presidents’ Bankers is a groundbreaking narrative of how an elite group of men transformed the American economy and government, dictated foreign and domestic policy, and shaped world history. \nCulled from original presidential archival documents, All the Presidents’ Bankers delivers an explosive account of the hundred-year interdependence between the White House and Wall Street that transcends a simple analysis of money driving politics—or greed driving bankers. \nPrins ushers us into the intimate world of exclusive clubs, vacation spots, and Ivy League universities that binds presidents and financiers. She unravels the multi-generational blood, intermarriage, and protégé relationships that have confined national influence to a privileged cluster of people. These families and individuals recycle their power through elected office and private channels in Washington, DC. \nAll the Presidents’ Bankers sheds new light on pivotal historic events—such as why, after the Panic of 1907, America’s dominant bankers convened to fashion the Federal Reserve System; how J. P. Morgan’s ambitions motivated President Wilson during World War I; how Chase and National City Bank chairmen worked secretly with President Roosevelt to rescue capitalism during the Great Depression while J.P. Morgan Jr. invited Roosevelt’s son yachting; and how American financiers collaborated with President Truman to construct the World Bank and IMF after World War II. \nPrins divulges how, through the Cold War and Vietnam era, presidents and bankers pushed America’s superpower status and expansion abroad, while promoting broadly democratic values and social welfare at home. But from the 1970s, Wall Street’s rush to secure Middle East oil profits altered the nature of political-financial alliances. Bankers’ profit motive trumped heritage and allegiance to public service, while presidents lost control over the economy—as was dramatically evident in the financial crisis of 2008. \nThis unprecedented history of American power illuminates how the same financiers retained their authoritative position through history, swaying presidents regardless of party affiliation. All the Presidents’ Bankers explores the alarming global repercussions of a system lacking barriers between public office and private power. Prins leaves us with an ominous choice: either we break the alliances of the power elite, or they will break us. About author", "output": "0. Fake"}

For years, Barack Obama has weathered a barrage of race-based hatred, with people who would become Trump’s Basket of Deplorables calling him “monkey” and “ape” and “n*gger”— and, yes, complaining that President Obama (who was born in Hawaii) needs to go “back to Africa.” In this case, Deplorable Fox News contributor Sean Hannity told the President to get on a plane to Kenya after the election and never return. \n“I have an offer for the President. I will charter a plane for you and your family,” Hannity said on his radio show. “I will charter it to the country of your choice. You want to go to Canada? I’ll pay for you to go to Canada. You want to go to Kenya? I’ll pay for you to go to Kenya. Jakarta, where you went to school back in the day, you can go back there.” \n“I will charter Donald Trump’s plane if he’ll let me,” Hannity added, noting that there is “one stipulation”—“You can’t come back!” \nNaturally, this message of “go back to Africa and stay there” resonated with conservatives, with many chiming in to offer their own suggestions on right-wing lie-factory Western Journalism’s comment section . Some suggested he be flown to Guantanamo Bay to be tortured for 50 years. Others suggested outright assassination. One man even made a creepy remark about stalking Malia Obama in the bathroom: \nAll of these people will be voting for Mr. Deplorable on November 28. Make sure you’re out there on November 8, when it’s actually Election Day. Listen to Hannity’s remarks below: \nFeatured image via screengrab/Getty Images(Chip Somodevilla) Related Written by John Prager John Prager is an unfortunate Liberal soul who lives uncomfortably in the middle of a Conservative hellscape.
